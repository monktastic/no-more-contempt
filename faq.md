### How are we supposed to fight evil, if not for contempt?

This work is primarily intended to answer the question "_why_ should we avoid contempt?" We can't give a complete answer as to *how* (other than "become enlightened"). Still, some things can be said.

As we've noted, people are _exquisitely_ sensitive to our motivations. It is entirely possible to fight fiercely (and even violently[^dalai-lama-gun]) without resorting to contempt. In that case, people can sense that our action is fundamentally benevolent, and so it doesn't reinforce the evil in their minds (though any latent evil may still play out for a while, which may make us fear it's not working).

This is only possible to the degree you recognize the evil as not being intrinsic to their minds (or, equivalently, to the degree you see yourself in them). Ultimately, everything comes down to that, and that in turn requires first discovering how your _own_ self-deception operates (see below).

Such behavior could be considered next-level "tough love." It can also be called compassion (more on that below).


### Self-deception (aka willful ignorance)

Have you ever done something that deep down you felt was wrong, but convinced yourself it was okay? Try and recall what that state is like. You knew perfectly well that what you were doing was wrong—according to your own conscience—but that knowledge was carefully hidden from conscious self-reflection. You somehow _knew_ but simultaneously _didn't_. It is a kind of schism in the mind, and it is where evil hides.

This mechanism is ultimately responsible for _all_ misbehavior. Even the most evil person could not do what they do without it, and conversely, you yourself are capable of almost anything under the right circumstances[^right-circumstances].

The more self-deception we harbor, the more eagerly we seek it out in others. We then try to force them to own up to theirs, but this backfires miserably: they can sense that we are in no position to be doing such a thing, and so they simply return the favor.

We act dismayed, but part of us secretly _wants_ this outcome...


### Contempt

> "When wickedness comes, so does contempt..." —Proverbs 18:3

Contempt is the feeling that you're fundamentally better than someone[^contempt]. Not just that you hold better views, or act better, but are *intrinsically* better. For example, "bad people" are fundamentally morally defective—unlike you. It's not necessarily a conscious belief, but a feeling and a perception.

There is a profound sense in which you are fundamentally the _same_ as everyone else. In fact, you _are_ everyone (and everything) "else." This isn't realized fully until enlightenment, but everyone can sense it at some level at all times. That's why [certain literature speaks to us so powerfully](/unity.md). Contempt is a way to hide this from yourself, and is thus self-deceptive.

You may not be able to detect this in yourself, but others can sense it—even if only subconsciously. They know the game you're playing, so they can't help but see _you_ as a "bad person" and feel compelled to fight your evil in return. You act dismayed by this recalcitrance—but you were secretly _hoping_ to provoke it, because it justifies your contempt. (This is the "game you're playing.")

Consider how much more satisfying it is to watch a bad person "get owned" than to see them have a change of heart—despite the latter actually being helpful. Part of us is more than happy to throw people under the bus in order to uphold our self-image as "good people" (if we have that self-image)—but this requires plausible deniability. This is why we must see them as _irredeemably_ bad: it leaves zero doubt that our malice is _good_.

It can be _extremely hard_ to admit (or even detect) that we're doing this, for obvious reasons. But it is not until we see exactly _why_ it's so hard that we begin to understand what prevents the "bad people" from consciously recognizing _their_ self-deception—and we can't fix what we don't understand. Until then, we are liable to unknowingly amplify it.

To summarize: all evil is enabled by self-deception, which itself is rooted in misperception. Contempt is a cleverly disguised attempt to induce this misperception in others—target, allies, and bystanders alike. It thereby enables more evil, regardless of who it is directed at—and part of us _needs_ this, to justify our misperception.


### Isn't it a little hyperbolic to call contempt "evil"?

Pause and notice how contempt, malice, hatred, and malevolence all have the same "flavor" or "signature." Once contempt is fully unmasked for what it is, you can literally _feel_ the malevolence—as though you are gleefully injecting evil into your target's very soul, while winking at them as if to remind them that you will get away with it. The trouble is, you ultimately won't.

It still sends a shudder down my spine to recall being forcefully shown that I was doing this—and that part of me _always_ knew.


### Inner light

The Buddhists (amongst others) believe that the fundamental nature of mind is pure compassion. But it's not just a belief: anyone with the time and desire can discover this for themselves. You can also get a taste of it on psychedelics. From this layer of mind, you can perceive that the same is true of all others, too. It's a feature of mind itself, strange as that may sound.

However, for various reasons, we lose contact with our "absolute goodness," which forces us to seek it _relatively_; that is, at the expense of others. We _need_ to see others as "bad" so that we can know ourselves as "good." This gives us an incentive to _make_ them bad. But even as we do so, part of us knows that we're doing this, so we have to hide it even harder, thus intensifying the process in a horrifying feedback loop. The worse we become, the harder it is to realize it.

In this state I _need_ evil to exist, so that I have something to fight, to prove my goodness.

Ironically, it is our memory of our original goodness that is the root cause of our misbehavior. Only by coming back into direct contact with it can we can stop contributing to this horrific cycle. That requires inner work. Evil keeps our attention fixated outward, on the evil "out there," precisely to prevent us from doing the one thing that could actually end it.


### Kindness / compassion

Compassion (which we're using interchangeably with "kindness") is the hardest word to define, but also the most important, since it is the only thing that actually fights evil.

We could say that it's acting in accordance with one's inner light. We could also say that it's being free of misperception / self-deception / malice, which amounts to the same thing. But it can be _exceptionally_ hard to detect self-deception in ourselves. In fact, the more righteous we feel, the more surely we are engaged in self-deception. Self-righteousness exists _only_ as a cover.

There are a few ways we usually get the definition wrong:

1. It does not simply mean "nice." Sometimes, being sweet and loving is the most compassionate response, and sometimes not. See the Dalai Lama quote, for example.

2. It is not about obeying some "moral principles." Reality is in constant flux, whereas principles never change. It is certainly not about _enforcing_ your principles on others, however "kind" they may be.

3. Hating bad people is not kind; it is evil. [Also see pseudo-kindness.]

Ultimately, it is about being radically honest with oneself. You could say that kindness is never "for" a particular person, but only ever for reality as a whole. It feels like a fierce, uncompromising love for the world. By this definition, it is _always_ the right motivation in every circumstance—though even this should not be thought of as a "principle," but as a pointer.

How does this "end evil"? By cutting through self-deception; i.e., reminding people of _their_ inner light. Yes, even shooting someone can do that under the right circumstances—though be very careful here: violence is almost always self-deception. Most situations require much more gentle reminders. Part of you always knows what you're really up to, and you _will_ have to confront it sooner or later.


### How do I know that my "inner light" knows what's best?

It doesn't. It merely ensures that you're acting with complete honesty and clean intention. You still need to learn which behaviors are helpful and harmful in which situations. This is wisdom, which compassion must be paired with to be truly effective.


### Pseudo-kindness

This is when we are cruel to one person in the name of helping another. This is cleverly-disguised evil, and is painfully common because it is somehow still socially acceptable.

For example, I am a vegetarian. I am embarrassed to admit that there was a time when I thought that contempt for non-vegetarians was good. That was pseudo-kindness.

(And on the flip side, I believe that veganism is even kinder, but have not been able to bring myself to commit fully. This is probably self-deception—though to be perfectly clear, your own compassion may point you to a different answer, and that is perfectly fine.)

I'm sure you can identify other pseudo-kind ideologies. There are many today.


### Idiot compassion

(Coined by Chogyam Trungpa.)

This is the inverse of pseudo-kindness: it is when we are _nice_ to someone in a way that enables bad behavior, because we can't bring ourselves to do the difficult but right thing.


### Impersonation

> _And no wonder, for even Satan masquerades as an angel of light. So it is not strange that his ministers also masquerade as ministers of righteousness._ —2 Corinthians 11:14-16

The trickiest thing about evil is that it masquerades as our light. When we are in close contact with our light, they are easy to tell apart. But each time we confuse them, it becomes progressively harder. Eventually there is no memory of the light at all, and "good" refers to some arbitrary (and secretly self-serving) principles. This is a difficult place to work your way back from.


### Does evil really exist?

> _For so long as the root of wickedness is hidden, it is strong. But when it is recognized, it is dissolved. When it is revealed, it perishes. ... It is powerful because we have not recognized it._ — The Gospel of Philip

Reality is actually one seamless interdependent whole. When we misperceive this, and attempt to separate ourselves out from it, we then behave in ways that reinforce that illusion. In a sense, evil is nothing but this process of reinforcement.

Perhaps, then, we could say that evil exists as a real misperception. What began as an innocent mistake spiraled out of control, and has taken on a seeming life of its own. It can thus be very useful to perceive evil as a distinct entity—as long as we remember that it's not separate from our own minds.

When did this "innocent mistake" begin? After all, evil clearly existed before our birth. What makes this so hard to communicate is that we're not describing not a process that began in time and space—those are constructs that our mind uses to make sense of reality once it has been (apparently) divided. This renders the "who started it" question moot. You could say we restart it in each moment of perception.

It may not be useful to get too into metaphysics here, but it can be helpful to recognize that all evil stems from the unwillingness or inability to recognize the humanity in other people; to _see_ yourself in them[^genocide]. It's actually broader than just people: destroying nature can be evil. It's a failure to recognize that what happens to the world ultimately happens to us, because in a profound and surprising sense, we _are_ the world. Harming it *always* comes back to bite us.

Ultimately, all self-deception boils down to feigned ignorance of this fact. Again, some literature is good at reminding us of this[^literature].


### What does the evil want?

As long as we're anthropomorphizing it, we could say that it attempts to escalate toward a full-blown Armageddon, in which each side can violently prove just how righteous they are, once and for all.

This is why the US is headed toward civil war, with nobody aware of their own complicity. It is also what [leads to bitter divorces](https://www.gottman.com/blog/this-one-thing-is-the-biggest-predictor-of-divorce/), in which each side feels like the exclusive victim / hero.


### Are there really evil people?

Some beings have become so separated from their inner light that there's effectively no memory of it left, and thus no discernible desire to be "good" in any meaningful sense. (Note that by this definition, even Hitler may not qualify: he believed he was doing good for humanity; loved his dog; etc. True _malevolence_ is exceedingly rare, thankfully.) It seems fair to apply the label "evil" to such people, but there are two important caveats.

First, contempt and malice are *still* the wrong response, for exactly the same reason as before.

Second, we often use the term "evil" as a cudgel for people who are nowhere near it: from their perspective, they really are doing what they consider "good." Our political rivals are a common example. This is just a license to be cruel.

The greatest risk when confronting such evil is that it will trigger our own, as described before. I genuinely don't know what to do in such situations, but I like to remember this fact:

While it is surely true that "evil wins when good people do nothing," the only thing worse than letting evil win is secretly joining forces with it. And the greater the evil, the more likely this becomes. Again, it's not that you join their particular _brand_ of evil, but that you elicit your own.

(Also note that "good people" as used here can be problematic since it implies the existence of fundamentally "bad people.")


### The role of psychedelics

This deserves its own piece. For now, I'll just share this question and answer from a [forum](https://web.archive.org/web/20150628081721/http://duncantrussell.com/forum/discussion/89/a-blessed-curse-psilocybinempathy/p1):

> Like many of you (I'm sure), psilocybin has changed the way I see this world, and the people around me. It has torn my heart open on many occasions and revealed to me how my actions effect other people in ways I would've never imagined. In addition (and to the point), **psilocybin has increased my ability to empathize with people to a degree I never thought possible**.
>
> I consider this a blessing, but it has also led me to a very troubling conclusion:
>
> The lack of compassion, empathy and love we (society) feel for each other is staggering. Especially between people who don't know each other. The more love and empathy I feel for others, the more aware I am of society's inability to feel it for each other.
>
> Does this make sense? Does it mean this blessing is really a curse? Because sometimes, it feels that way.

> *Nail on the head brother. My most recent mushroom trip (also the largest dose I've ever taken) I became fixated on a news story I had heard that week. About an 8 year old girl from a tribe in the Amazon, who was [tied to a tree and burned alive](https://www.survivalinternational.org/news/8033) in order to scare her people off their land so it could be logged. I realized that at the moment he did it, whoever lit that gasoline actually felt / thought more or less okay about what he was doing. **And my mind was illuminated with dozens of the parallels between that man's malformed, horrific perceptual / behavioral state, and mine. I saw the same mistakes in value attribution, the same willful ignorance of the consequences of my acts and words. And there was nothing I could do to deny the similarity.***
>
> *Reminds me of something (I think) Duncan [Trussell] said on some recent podcast, quoting somebody else: it isn't the victim of violence you have to pray for so much. It's the perpetrator. They are the one who is more trapped in delusion, more estranged from love, etc.*


### Near-death experiences

These can have a similar effect as psychedelics.

> I wasn’t just watching the events; I was actually reliving them again, while at the same time I was also re-experiencing the actions from other people’s points of view. I _was_ them. I was reliving the experience from their point of view and at the same time (and I don’t know how this works) I was also experiencing it from a higher reality; the truth of the matter. So what I saw was my own lies and my own self deception to myself, which I had used to convince me that doing certain things was okay because people had deserved it. Then I was experiencing the emotional impact it had on other people. I felt their pain. I felt the shock on them. At the same time I also saw that they have their own lies and self-deceptions.
>
> The result was that I felt like a failure as a person. I wasn’t the person I had thought I was. It was humiliating. I felt really dreadful and it was completely humbling.
>
> The judgment came all from myself. It was not from an outside source. But then this being that was with me was also sending me comforting messages – thank goodness! – and one of them was it was alright as I was only human.
>
> The entire experience gave me a second chance to live a more meaningful life. I felt I had a chance now to change things so that the next time I get back to the life review it wouldn’t be the same or at least they would say, “He tried.”

You _will_ have to confront your hidden misbehavior sooner or later; it doesn't just evaporate from reality. Might as well make it sooner.


### Are _you_ a saint / enlightened?

Hell no.


### Then what gives you the right to lecture me on morality?

Sorry, that's not the intent. I am a complete hypocrite and have no right to lecture anyone. I'm just sharing something I've seen, because I believe it is helpful.


### What is this crazy background image?

I made it with DALL-E 3. [Here it is](img/buddha.png).

## Footnotes

[^contempt]: To be clear, contempt for ideas or behavior can be perfectly healthy.

[^genocide]: Note that genocides generally start with dehumanization. The Nazis referred to Jews as 'vermin' and during the genocide in Rwanda, Tutsis were referred to as 'cockroaches.'

[^right-circumstances]: You have _no idea_ how slippery the slope to full-blown evil is. Thank your lucky stars that the right circumstances haven't manifested to send you down it. If you believe you are immune, this is the surest sign that evil has already colonized the deepest part of your mind.

[^dalai-lama-gun]: The Dalai Lama was once asked what you should do if a gunman is trying to shoot you and you have a gun. [He said "shoot back."](https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/dalai-gun/)
