When you look into the eyes of a depraved person, it can feel like something in them *wants* you to hate them—like a secret invitation to join them in darkness. In fact, it's almost as though the *darkness itself* is issuing this invite, while the person is merely a carrier for it. That dark force is more than happy to sacrifice them for its grander vision: dominion over our world.

This is an admittedly mystical framing, but for an important reason. The more deeply we see how this dynamic operates in our own minds, the more obvious it becomes that our usual frameworks for understanding evil are part of the problem—almost as if by design. An alternate framing is needed if we are to get to the root of the problem, which is prerequisite to solving it.

The painful truth is that as long as we still mentally divide the world into *fundamentally* good and bad people, or find it possible to feel contempt for *anyone* for *any reason*, we will fall into some version of this trap without realizing it. We will use the darkness in others to license some sort of self-serving behavior of our own that we will struggle to recognize as such—and which will thereby invite others to do the same, in a self-perpetuating cycle whose ultimate origin will continue to escape our notice.

It is not only contempt for *people* that is the problem. Our ecological and climate problems can also be seen as the result of a fundamental contempt—for nature itself

When you look into the eyes of a depraved person, it can feel like something in them *wants* you to hate them—like a secret invitation to join them in darkness. In fact, it's almost as though the *darkness itself*, and not the person, is issuing this invite. The person is merely a carrier for that ancient parasite, which is more than happy to sacrifice its host to expand its sinister empire. The only reason we ever fall for this trap is that we ourselves have the capacity for darkness, which theirs is finding resonance with.

When we're aware of this trap, we usually have the good sense not to fall for it. We may still do whatever is necessary to *stop* them, but we refuse to let their evil infect our own minds—for example, by refraining from cruelty, which we know would only feed it. Therefore, the darkness has evolved to express itself in far subtler ways that escape our conscious notice—that indeed, we refuse to believe, even when it's clearly pointed out.

It is why we feel compelled to mock and shame our enemies. Their darkness is provoking us into this behavior—and although we may have the good sense not to respond with overt cruelty, we still can't help but take the bait in *some* form. It's not that shaming is inherently wrong, but we find a way to infuse it with a subtle malice that provokes our enemy into doubling down and fighting back harder—which we then use as an excuse to escalate, never realizing that *we* have become the ones inviting others into the dark.

Our apparent fights with our enemies are merely decoys. The darkness in our minds is actually *collaborating*, using our supposed fights as a way to entrench itself more deeply in all of us while making us feel flawlessly certain we are valiantly fighting it.

It's impossible to overstate just how subtle this trap has become. Mocking and shaming aren't required. It's enough to simply harbor *contempt*—the belief that others are *fundamentally defective*; that we are *intrinsically superior* to them. It feels impossibly righteous, but the truth is that the only reason we ever feel this way is that our darkness is trying to find resonance with that in others—be they friend or foe. And given the state of our society, it *always* finds it.



[Another reason we don't respond with overt cruelty is that we know it would make us look bad. Alternate story:

There's something primally satisfying about violently punishing evil, so part of us has the perverse incentive to create more of it, continually escalating until finally we are forced to unleash the full extent of our righteous wrath. But if we knew we were doing this, it wouldn't work, because it is the furthest thing from righteous. So we find incredibly clever ways to reinforce the darkness under the guise of good. The most devious of all is this...]
