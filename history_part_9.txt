**Note**: *This essay explores uncomfortable truths about the nature of evil and our own hidden roles in perpetuating it. It asks for honest self-reflection — not as judgment, but as a necessary step towards healing ourselves and our world.*

> _Be kind, for everyone you meet is fighting a great battle._ —Author unknown

What is kindness? It is the only thing that actually fights evil. Everything else just makes it worse.

---

The deepest part of you can perceive yourself in literally everyone and everything, strange as that may sound; yet you hide this knowledge from your conscious mind, so that you don't have to feel their suffering. It is this same mechanism that enables the "bad people" to do what *they* do: their minds are shielding them from fully perceiving the *life* in their victims — be they other people, animals, or nature at large. This is the secret principle behind *all the evil there ever was.*

Any time any one of us employs this shielding, we lower the threshold for everyone else to do the same — no matter how noble our intent. For example, when we witness evil, we often feel compelled to not only *stop* the evildoer, but to *harm* them — quite independently of any good it will do. This is hard to admit. We tell ourselves that it is "for the greater good," but part of us simply enjoys seeing the "bad people" suffer.

Is this wrong? So long as our behavior produces some good — which it actually might, at least in the short term – why does it matter how we feel about it? All that should matter is the outcome. *So what* if we get to feel a bit of glee from watching "bad people" suffer? It is a private pleasure that has no bearing on the result.

But this is a dark lie.

Not only can our target sense our malicious intent, but we secretly *want* them to. It telegraphs that we're under the sway of the very sickness we're viciously judging *them* for, thus baiting them into behavior we can use as justification to escalate. Something in us *wants* to be forced to unleash the full extent of our righteous wrath — and it will stop at nothing to ensure this outcome.

This is the *only* purpose of contempt (for other people). It is a fundamentally malicious attitude secretly meant to drive the darkness deeper *into* people's minds, where we can violently judge them for it, while giving ourselves plausible deniability: we are only *fighting evil,* after all — and how could that ever be wrong?

It is worth pausing to reflect on the cleverness of this ruse. Simply *entertaining* the darkness in your own mind is sufficient to spread it, despite there being no external evidence of it. The deepest part of us *knows* when we've done this, but we carefully hide this knowledge from our conscious minds, thereby disowning it. Yet that darkness continues to live on in the world, orphaned; giving rise to countless knock-on effects that we never recognize our own connection to.

It is not until we appreciate the terrifying genius of this mechanism that we begin to recognize exactly what is going on in the minds of the "bad people," and how we can be of service in ending it. It's not that they *don't know* that they're doing wrong, but something is preventing them from fully confronting it — and this "something" is profoundly intertwined with our own decisions, much as we hate to admit it. In fact, it is this *refusal to admit it* that allows it to thrive.

> _And no wonder, for even Satan masquerades as an angel of light. So it is not strange that his ministers also masquerade as ministers of righteousness._ —2 Corinthians 11:14-16

Evil is a kind of mind-virus. We recognize it easily in others but never in ourselves. It tricks us into perceiving them as *fundamentally defective* and thus completely unlike us; never realizing that this very attitude is the surest sign that we are under its dark command. By acceding to this misperception, we are silently affirming that *darkness is the way.* It is like a secret handshake between our darkness and theirs — which it turns out aren't separate at all.

<p align="center" width="100%">
    <img width="300px" src="img/parasite.png"> 
</p>
The Darkness behaves more like a _singular distributed malevolent entity_, manipulating all of humanity from beneath our conscious thresholds. The Christians know it as the Devil, and the Buddhists call it the ego. You can treat it as a metaphor, but it is as real as anything you can touch. It is why we sometimes suspect the existence of an evil global conspiracy. It is the _primordial_ evil conspiracy; the one to which all the rest owe their existence and to which they ultimately filter up.

This entity drives us relentlessly toward Armageddon — situations in which everyone is violently proving how _righteous_ they are. It is why the US may be headed toward civil war, and explains bitter [divorces](https://www.gottman.com/blog/this-one-thing-is-the-biggest-predictor-of-divorce/)  where each side feels like the exclusive victim / hero. Nearly the whole world is caught in its terrible sway, evil provoking evil at every turn, without anyone recognizing its true origin deep within our psyches.

Every act of unkindness we've ever perpetrated on anyone; all the hardness we carry in our hearts; has only ever been in service of humanity's ultimate nemesis.

<p align="center" width="100%">
    <img width="300px" src="img/evil-above-world.png"> 
</p>

---

To be clear: there really *are* people who knowingly serve the Darkness, and who conspire to cause great harm. They must be stopped, and this isn't always "nice." But to the extent that we perceive them as *fundamentally* defective, or ourselves as *intrinsically superior* — in short, with contempt — we are falling into the ultimate trap. Contempt for *beliefs* or *behaviors* isn't necessarily harmful, but contempt for people always is. It exists only to help us hide our own darkness from ourselves by reinforcing it in others — allies, enemies, and bystanders alike.

The vast majority of dark behavior feels **absolutely nothing like evil**. It simply feels like "business as usual." We find all kinds of ways to justify self-serving behavior, using the sorry state of the world as an excuse. Corporations cheat us, so what's wrong with skimming from them? Our political opponents are morally defective, so why shouldn't we mock and shame them? An infinite variety of examples abounds, most of which are too subtle to capture in words.

It is not that skimming or shaming are inherently wrong, but we disregard that quiet voice warning us that we are lying to ourselves. The more we lie, the more we lose the ability to even detect that it *is* a lie. The "little voice" gets increasingly drowned out by clever justifications, which we fail to recognize as such — because why would our own minds lie to us? 

This is the trap in which modern humanity is caught. We have abandoned our inner knowing for clever judgments, writing off such knowing as religious myth.

<p align="center" width="100%">
    <img width="300px" src="img/angel-devil-shoulders.png"> 
</p>

Every time any one of us makes this mistake — which happens *far more often* than we realize — we are strengthening the same capacity in everyone else. The dark lies that politicians use to foment wars are made of the very same "stuff" as the lies we tell ourselves. Again, it's not just the same *kind* of stuff. Every act of self-deception gets woven into the very fabric of our reality, accumulating in the body politic, reconfiguring itself, eventually erupting in the form of atrocities that we feel *absolutely no connection* to — and which then serve as justification for *more*.

Without recognizing our own role in all this, it is impossible to do actual good in the world. Instead, we will continually buy into whichever narratives sound best — never recognizing that no matter how "good" they are, we are secretly just feeding the Beast. If we really want to know whether a cause is "good" or not, we cannot simply evaluate its *contents*. We must be able to feel into its *origin.* **So much suffering** could be avoided if we only learned to recognize this.

Thus, the entire fight against evil comes down to recognizing this "deeper knowing." For it is only by seeing how cleverly the darkness has manipulated our own minds that we discover the true meaning of *kindness* — and to appreciate its unique power to defeat our common nemesis.

> _For so long as the root of wickedness is hidden, it is strong. But when it is recognized, it is dissolved. When it is revealed, it perishes. ... It is powerful because we have not recognized it._ — The Gospel of Philip

There can be moments in life — such as during psychedelic trips, near-death experiences, or deep meditation or prayer — when you are confronted with the full depths of your own self-deception. You are shown every single instance where you skirted your conscience; every act of lying to yourself for your own personal gain. You are brought face-to-face with all the harm you've ever perpetrated from time immemorial, and it is more than you could hope to clean up in a single lifetime. The pain is beyond what you can fathom; more than you can bear. How widely and quickly it spread! How many it affected! The darkness exploited your fear and pride, enabling you to do things you couldn't have if only you had been totally honest.

The guilt is overwhelming. But then it dawns on you: the only reason it hurts so much is that you never actually wanted to do this. It is only profound confusion that enabled it. Your whole being is absorbed into that part of you that never wanted to hurt anyone; never _could_ want such a thing. Then, suddenly, the full mass of darkness lifts from your mind. It feels like being freed of a demonic possession. Beneath it is a Light so vast that it defies description; an infinite Love for all of reality that excludes nothing and forsakes no-one. This Light is what you ultimately are — *wonder of wonders* — and surprisingly, *so is everyone else*.

In fact, you ultimately _are_ everyone and everything else, just pretending that you're not. One consciousness, peering out through countless eyes. There are many ways to say this, all of which sound absurd to the rational mind. But when you fully unveil the Light in yourself, you automatically see it in everyone else — including those who convincingly seem not to have any. This is what the darkness is trying to hide.

Everything we do to each other — or to Nature herself — we ultimately do to ourselves. It is impossible to benefit ourselves at the world's expense, because we *are* the world. How crazy to think otherwise! How foolish to judge others for not seeing it, when we couldn't see it yet ourselves! In fact, this is the only way we *could* judge them. 

We are continually shoving each other into the abyss to prevent others from waking up, because we're not ready to wake up ourselves. Seeing this, we lose all desire to "get away" with anything. Why would we want to? How did we ever think we could?
<p align="center" width="100%">
    <img width="300px" src="img/tribe.png"> 
</p>
---

The strangest part is discovering how you simultaneously _knew_ all this and yet somehow _didn't_. You convinced yourself that your unkind behavior was "for the greater good," even as you knew better. You could always perceive the Light in the "bad people," but chose to violently smother it anyway — believing that if you compartmentalized knowledge of this crime carefully enough, nobody could blame you for it, because _you yourself_ would no longer know. Yet they somehow always knew.

You now see _how_ they knew despite your astonishingly clever attempts to hide it. At the very deepest level, your mind is not separate from theirs. It's not that others can read your mind, per se, but your inner motivations inevitably leak into your outer reality; the two being fundamentally inseparable. Everything you do "in here" has an impact "out there," whether you see it or not.

The deepest motivation of all is to be of service to the Whole and not just to a part. This is a choice you make in every moment, whether you know it or not. Others can sense this choice at a subconscious level, and it influences their own. Your unwillingness to forsake them under any circumstances slowly reminds their darkness of the *one thing* it can never truly hide from. This is the *only* way that evil evaporates from our world. If you been freed from your own, it is only due to the grace of countless "others," whom you now honor by paying it forward.

There is no way to force others to see any of this; force being a manifestation of the same fundamental mistake. Those who are most powerful at inducing this realization in others are simply those who hold it most strongly themselves. They are literally incapable of feeling malice, contempt, or self-righteousness toward *anybody* for *any reason*, having thoroughly recognized them as weapons of the Darkness. Yet such people are not weak. They are unafraid to fiercely confront the darkness in others. 

This is true kindness, and it has nothing to do with being nice. It need not take any form in particular. Its only defining characteristic is that it is utterly free of self-deception. It surgically targets the parasite itself, instead of the confused being who unwittingly harbors it. The profound integrity of this act prevents their parasite from finding the excuse it would otherwise use to reinforce itself, and is weakened as a result. The more entrenched a person's darkness, the more fierce the kindness required to uproot it. It may be tough love, but it is always Love.

In the same way that your darkness can extend a secret handshake to others, your Light can do the same. It is nowhere near as violently pleasurable as subjugating them, but infinitely more valuable.

---

If we ultimately are the Light, how on Earth did we get to this place that looks nothing like it? This process is extremely tricky to convey, because it doesn't fit into our culture's standard metaphysics. We began as undifferentiated Light, but then made the mistake of subtly turning away from it. Then, fearing that we'd lost contact with our _absolute_ goodness, we went out seeking for it _relatively_ — that is, at the expense of "others." This simultaneously *created* those "others," who we then felt compelled to violently defeat, in order to prove our own goodness and thereby return Home. But this just made things worse, and the whole thing quickly spiraled out of control. This is the apparent reality in which we now live.

The hardest thing to communicate about this story is that it does not unfold in what we normally conceive of as linear time. In a profound and surprising sense, every moment is the very first. Thus, every instant is an opportunity to rediscover our primordial Home, a place we never truly left. Each time we see this, we increasingly discover how our judgements of others are actually pointers back to an unhealed part of ourselves. As we heal ourselves, we discover how to heal our relationship with the "other," until it slowly dawns on us that there was never truly an "other."

The more we see this, the more we vow to hold the Light for these seeming others, even when — indeed, _especially_ when — they cannot hold it for themselves. Far from being a burden, we discover that this has always been our true purpose; our deepest calling. Every encounter with evil becomes an opportunity to strengthen our commitment to the Light.

Looked at this way, kindness is anything that brings us all closer to remembering the truth, and evil is anything that pushes us away from it. Forsaking others is thus always a form of evil. It is a form of forsaking ourselves, because we are not ready to come Home yet. If this language feels too religious for you, feel free to find your own framing. In the end, there is only one Truth.

> *Darkness cannot drive out darkness, only light can do that. Hate cannot drive out hate, only love can do that.* ― Martin Luther King, Jr.

Unlike the Light, the darkness is not a real entity. It is a profound absence masquerading as a presence. This is why it cannot be defeated by more absence. Yet make no mistake: it still behaves like a sinister presence. It manipulates our perception at such a fundamental level that we simply cannot fathom that we're being fooled. We're certain that we're seeing reality _as it is_. It is an _impossibly_ clever trick, but one we can learn to see through.

Revenge fantasy films, YouTube videos of "Karens getting owned," Facebook threads full of casual cruelty and jokes about "Darwin awards" — each is a breeding ground for our collective Demon. It all seeps into our physical reality, slowly poisoning it. Everything from our unhealthy air, water, and soil, to our myriad societal ills and the climate crisis itself, is ultimately an external manifestation of a sickness within. As long as we perceive it to exist only in others, we will never discover its hidden aspect in ourselves. This is in no way suggesting that we are all equally complicit. Yet we each have a unique role to play in leading us all back to the Light.

To be clear: it does no good to pretend that we can see the Light in others when we can't. Doing so can backfire miserably. Thus, both pretending to see the Light in others and overlooking it can be harmful. The only solution is to learn to *actually* see it, which happens as a natural consequence of unveiling our own. Similarly, it is astonishingly easy to lie to ourselves about whether our violent behavior is "radical kindness" or merely self-deception. This is a common way for the darkness to sneak in.

Perhaps the clearest measure of our ability to deceive ourselves is how much contempt we still feel for our enemies. To the degree that this potential is still present, we are susceptible to sliding down the dark path that has enabled every genocide, without ever realizing that we are. All that is required is the right — or wrong — confluence of circumstances. To believe yourself immune is the greatest of follies, and the surest indication that you are *not.*

---

There are vast and subtle networks of causality that we normally hide from ourselves, and that secretly drive the fate of the world. Everything we do makes a difference, in ways that we can hardly fathom. If we pay attention only to the surface activity, we miss out on the bulk of what actually shapes our reality. Evil can look sweet and pretty, while kindness sometimes looks nothing of the sort. It is impossible to know which is which — and easy to convince ourselves otherwise — until we have done the deep inner work that eradicates the core confusion. 

We each catch glimpses of the Light from time to time, and it is our duty to carry them into the world as best we are able. I wish I could tell you that I have completed the journey myself, but alas, I am a mere fledgling. I am still liable to mess things up royally, and I only ask that you hold my feet to the fire when I do — for all of our sakes. I promise to do the same for you.

May all beings be free from suffering and its causes. Amen.

If we ultimately are the Light, how on Earth did we get to this place that looks nothing like it? This process is extremely tricky to convey, because it doesn't fit into our culture's standard metaphysics. We began as undifferentiated Light, but then made the mistake of subtly turning away from it. Then, fearing that we'd lost contact with our _absolute_ goodness, we went out seeking for it _relatively_ — that is, at the expense of "others." This simultaneously *created* those "others," who we then felt compelled to violently defeat, in order to prove our own goodness and thereby return Home. But this just made things worse, and the whole thing quickly spiraled out of control. This is the apparent reality in which we now live.

The hardest thing to communicate about this story is that it does not unfold in what we normally conceive of as linear time. In a profound and surprising sense, every moment is the very first. Thus, every instant is an opportunity to rediscover our primordial Home, a place we never truly left. Each time we see this, we increasingly discover how our judgements of others are actually pointers back to an unhealed part of ourselves. As we heal ourselves, we discover how to heal our relationship with the "other," until it slowly dawns on us that there was never truly an "other."

The more we see this, the more we vow to hold the Light for these seeming others, even when — indeed, _especially_ when — they cannot hold it for themselves. Far from being a burden, we discover that this has always been our true purpose; our deepest calling. Every encounter with evil becomes an opportunity to strengthen our commitment to the Light.

Looked at this way, kindness is anything that brings us all closer to remembering the truth, and evil is anything that pushes us away from it. Forsaking others is thus always a form of evil. It is a form of forsaking ourselves, because we are not ready to come Home yet. If this language feels too religious for you, feel free to find your own framing. In the end, there is only one Truth.

> *Darkness cannot drive out darkness, only light can do that. Hate cannot drive out hate, only love can do that.* ― Martin Luther King, Jr.

Unlike the Light, the darkness is not a real entity. It is a profound absence masquerading as a presence. This is why it cannot be defeated by more absence. Yet make no mistake: it still behaves like a sinister presence. It manipulates our perception at such a fundamental level that we simply cannot fathom that we're being fooled. We're certain that we're seeing reality _as it is_. It is an _impossibly_ clever trick, but one we can learn to see through.

Revenge fantasy films, YouTube videos of "Karens getting owned," Facebook threads full of casual cruelty and jokes about "Darwin awards" — each is a breeding ground for our collective Demon. It all seeps into our physical reality, slowly poisoning it. Everything from our unhealthy air, water, and soil, to our myriad societal ills and the climate crisis itself, is ultimately an external manifestation of a sickness within. As long as we perceive it to exist only in others, we will never discover its hidden aspect in ourselves. This is in no way suggesting that we are all equally complicit. Yet we each have a unique role to play in leading us all back to the Light.

To be clear: it does no good to pretend that we can see the Light in others when we can't. Doing so can backfire miserably. Thus, both pretending to see the Light in others and overlooking it can be harmful. The only solution is to learn to *actually* see it, which happens as a natural consequence of unveiling our own. Similarly, it is astonishingly easy to lie to ourselves about whether our violent behavior is "radical kindness" or merely self-deception. This is a common way for the darkness to sneak in.

Perhaps the clearest measure of our ability to deceive ourselves is how much contempt we still feel for our enemies. To the degree that this potential is still present, we are susceptible to sliding down the dark path that has enabled every genocide, without ever realizing that we are. All that is required is the right — or wrong — confluence of circumstances. To believe yourself immune is the greatest of follies, and the surest indication that you are *not.*

---

There are vast and subtle networks of causality that we normally hide from ourselves, and that secretly drive the fate of the world. Everything we do makes a difference, in ways that we can hardly fathom. If we pay attention only to the surface activity, we miss out on the bulk of what actually shapes our reality. Evil can look sweet and pretty, while kindness sometimes looks nothing of the sort. It is impossible to know which is which — and easy to convince ourselves otherwise — until we have done the deep inner work that eradicates the core confusion. 

We each catch glimpses of the Light from time to time, and it is our duty to carry them into the world as best we are able. I wish I could tell you that I have completed the journey myself, but alas, I am a mere fledgling. I am still liable to mess things up royally, and I only ask that you hold my feet to the fire when I do — for all of our sakes. I promise to do the same for you.

May all beings be free from suffering and its causes. Amen.

> _For so long as the root of wickedness is hidden, it is strong. But when it is recognized, it is dissolved. When it is revealed, it perishes. ... It is powerful because we have not recognized it._ — The Gospel of Philip

Consider the "bad people" of the world — the murderers, rapists, child abusers; the greedy bankers, hypocritical CEOs, corrupt politicians, etc. Don't they seem *fundamentally different* from the rest of us — as though they are somehow *intrinsically* morally defective? Sure, the rest of us may occasionally get up to some trouble, but it's not the same thing at all.

The truth is that the aspect of your mind that lets you believe this is precisely the same aspect that allows the "bad people" to do what *they* do — and by giving in to yours, you *reinforce* that same capacity in them. This requires a bit of unpacking.

Think back to a time when you skirted your conscience — that is, behaved in a way that went against your own deepest values, but somehow convinced yourself was okay. It can be hard to admit that you've done this, but we all have. In that state, part of you knew *perfectly well* that you were doing wrong, but this knowledge was carefully hidden from conscious self-reflection, so that it didn't *feel* wrong. All you consciously heard were your own clever justifications.

It is precisely this state that has enabled *all the evil there ever was,* from the tiniest act of unkindness to the most horrific atrocity — and any time any one of us engages in it, we strengthen that same capacity in everyone else. By its very nature, the vast majority of this behavior is hidden from our conscious minds, so that we only see the very tip of the iceberg.

> _Be kind, for everyone you meet is fighting a great battle._ —Author unknown

Reflect on how it feels to mock and shame your political enemies. Part of you *knows* that you're judging them for a flaw that you yourself are highly susceptible to — but this is nearly impossible to admit. At the same time, your enemy can sense that this is what's really happening, and so it makes them see *you* as evil in response. This, in turn, convinces you that you were *right* about them: after all, only a *fundamentally defective* person could think that *you* are the evil one here.

The darkness in your mind — the thing that allows you to hide from your own conscience — is infinitely more clever than you can fathom. It secretly orchestrated this whole ruse. It hides itself perfectly from your own mind while sensitizing you to its presence in others, precisely so that you will treat them with contempt, thereby *strengthening* its grip on both of you, while leaving you each feeling like you were acting righteously.

This is an incredibly subtle point, and one that's easy to misunderstand. In fact, the darkness *needs* you to misunderstand. Of course evil actions must be "judged" — so long as judgement simply means wise discernment. And appropriate action must be taken, even if it requires outwardly violent behavior. None of this by itself creates darkness. But there is a kind of "inward violence" — best captured by the word *contempt* — that always sullies even the most well-intended behavior. This is contempt not just for beliefs or behaviors but for *people themselves*.

---

The hallmark of evil is that the perpetrator's mind is shielding them from perceiving the *life* in their victims — be they other people, animals, or nature at large. There can be moments in life — such as in deep meditation, or on psychedelics, or near-death experiences — where one can be shown the full depth of depravity possible in a mind. It is a profoundly harrowing experience. At the same time, one discovers that it is **exactly** the same trick that has enabled one's own contempt for the "bad people." Hating them is how I hide my own self-deception from myself, thereby ensuring that I never heal the one bit of darkness I actually have full power over.

Believe me when I say that **nothing** is more painful than being shown how I've been shoving my fellow beings deeper into the abyss while claiming not to know what I was doing. I've been *smothering* their inner Light by pretending they don't have any. This makes me the **ultimate** hypocrite. I saw how every bit of news that triggers my contemptuous outrage is actually a place where my *own* unkindness has leaked out into the world, enabling me to safely judge it from afar. Again, the key word is *contemptuous.* There is nothing wrong with outrage, per se.

The darkness *needs* you to see yourself as different and special — if only in the sense of being "good person" — because once you do, the rest is all but guaranteed. It is always the same trick, and it always has the same effect. You *will* license yourself to engage in subtly self-serving behaviors that you will not recognize as such — and by doing so, secretly license others to do the same. And because you won't know that you've done this, you will then judge them for it, reinforcing the whole cycle without any awareness of your own complicity.

> _And no wonder, for even Satan masquerades as an angel of light. So it is not strange that his ministers also masquerade as ministers of righteousness._ —2 Corinthians 11:14-16

This is why some people fear the existence of an "evil global conspiracy" pulling the strings behind the scenes. The darkness in of all of our minds is indeed conspiring, behaving more like a singular *distributed malevolent entity*. The Christians know it as the Devil, and the Buddhists call it the Ego. It is the *primordial* evil conspiracy; the one to which all the rest owe their existence, and to which they all ultimately filter up. Every attempt to destroy it without being free of it yourself only ends up strengthening it, thus causing you to externalize it *even harder*.

This is why there is no substitute for evicting the darkness from your own mind first. Until then, you are always liable to run directly into this trap — and you will almost certainly not realize it until it's too late. You will then have to rely on someone wiser than yourself to help pull you out. Everyone else will be too busy contemptuously judging *you,* not realizing what *they* are doing.

The darkness is like a parasite — and like all parasites, it can be evicted. What lies underneath —what you ultimately *are* in your innermost being — is an infinite Love for all of Reality. Not a gentle, passive love, but a **ferocious compassion** that excludes nothing and forsakes no-one. It can manifest as fearsome wrath when necessary to protect the Whole, but its root is always Love; never malice or contempt.

This Love **is** all of Reality: One Life, peering through countless eyes, longing to come Home to itself; to remember itself. That is what you are — what everyone is — which is why your deepest longing is to be of service to the Whole. This is why any harm you cause others, or Nature herself, ultimately harms you; and why forsaking them ultimately only forsakes yourself.

---

To be clear: there are people whose infection runs so deep that naively "trying to see the good" in them can backfire miserably. Thus, pretending to see their Light when you can't, or believing they have none, both lead to terrible outcomes. The only solution is to learn to **actually** see it in them — a capacity that awakens naturally as you unveil the Light within yourself. The more you do this, the more you are able to subdue their darkness without accidentally reinforcing it. A mind that is free of self-deception simply cannot feel malice, contempt, or self-righteousness, no matter the circumstances, because it sees where these inevitably lead.

I know this may all sound bizarre, but part of you recognizes this truth, even if your mind describes it in different language. Find that part of you and trust it above all else. Everything that distracts from this inner knowing, every justification for contempt or self-deception, is a whisper from the darkness. By remaining steadfastly connected to this source of Good within, you not only heal yourself but contribute to the healing of the world – achieving far more in the true "fight against Evil" than all the cunning strategies your darkness could ever devise.

May all beings be free of suffering and its causes. Amen.

> _Be kind, for everyone you meet is fighting a great battle._ —Author unknown

Reflect on how it feels to mock and shame your enemies. Part of you *knows* that you are not fundamentally superior to them; that any harm they cause is the result of a kind of self-deception that you yourself are susceptible to. But this is nearly impossible to admit to oneself. Still, your enemy can sense what you're really up to, making them see *you* as evil in response. This, in turn, convinces you that you were *right* about them: after all, only a *fundamentally defective* person could think that *you* are the evil one.

The darkness in your mind — the thing that allows you to hide from your conscience —  secretly orchestrated this ruse. It telegraphed itself to your enemy while hiding itself from you, specifically to provoke their darkness in a way that would leave you both feeling righteous. It is like a *secret handshake* between your darkness and theirs.

Of course evil actions should be "judged" — so long as judgement simply means wise discernment. And appropriate action *must* be taken, even if it requires outwardly violent behavior. But we rarely leave it at that. The darkness in our mind usually finds a way to inject itself into our behavior in a way that we can plausibly deny. We weren't *provoking* their darkness — we were fighting it!

But that's what contempt *is*: our darkness leaking in a way that feels *righteous*. To be clear, this means contempt for *people.* Contempt for beliefs or behaviors can sometimes be wielded wisely. Mockery and shaming aren't inherently wrong — but we almost always inject them with contempt, turning them vehicles of our darkness.

The hallmark of evil is that the perpetrator's mind is shielding them from perceiving the *life* in their victims — be they other people, animals, or nature at large. There can be moments in life — such as in deep meditation, or on psychedelics, or near-death experiences — where we glimpse the full depth of depravity possible in a mind.

Again, the key word is *contemptuous* — there is nothing wrong with outrage itself.

The darkness *needs* us to see ourselves as different and special — because once we do, the rest is all but guaranteed. Ironically, simply by seeing ourselves as *fundamentally good* people — in contrast to those who are *fundamentally bad* — we will *necessarily* license ourselves to engage in some subtly self-serving behavior that we will not recognize as such — and by doing so, secretly license those "bad people" to do the same. We then judge them for it, reinforcing the whole cycle without any awareness of our own complicity.

This is how the darkness spreads.

> _And no wonder, for even Satan masquerades as an angel of light. So it is not strange that his ministers also masquerade as ministers of righteousness._ —2 Corinthians 11:14-16

The darkness in of all of our minds together behaves like a singular *distributed malevolent entity*. The Christians know it as the Devil, and the Buddhists call it the Ego. It is why some believe in an evil global conspiracy. It is the *primordial* conspiracy; the one to which all the rest owe their existence, and to which they all ultimately filter up. Every attempt to destroy it without being free of it ourselves only strengthens it, causing us to externalize it even harder, in a vicious cycle.

There is no substitute for evicting the darkness from your own mind first. Until then, you are always liable to run into this trap. We all think we would have been *fighting* the Nazis instead of being one of them — but to the degree that we can still feel contempt for them (or anyone else), we've got it backwards. That is the surest sign that we're susceptible to going down a dark path ourselves.
