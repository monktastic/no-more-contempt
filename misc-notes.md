## Notes


- By now we know that "you cannot reason someone out of a position they didn't reason themselves into," and that we are biased toward information that confirms our positions and against any that question it. But you also cannot fix this bias with more reasoning, because...

 
- Your darkness (i.e., your parasite) is like the classic devil on your shoulder. But it doesn't just whisper obviously-bad ideas in your ear; it _alters your very perception_ at such a fundamental level that you don't even realize you're being fooled. It just looks like "reality."
  - In fact, it doesn't just "alter" your reality; it _literally creates it_. It is the part that [hallucinates your conscious reality](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyu7v7nWzfo) (though even this is not the full picture, as you will read).
  - It is what the Buddhists call the _ego._
  - This is why the whole piece may be hard to believe. Our view of reality feels so obviously and objectively true that questioning it seems insane.
  - This is why we see "the speck in our brother's eye" and overlook the plank in our own.
  - The angel on your shoulder _is_ actually intrinsic to your mind. It is what the Buddhists call your "true nature."


- Something in us _wants_ to see the worst in people, and we use contempt to goad people into justifying this perception. Watch any heated debate and you can see both people doing this — except that you will almost certainly only see it in the side you disagree with, whereas your enemies will see the opposite.


- When in a contemptuous crowd or atmosphere, it is very easy to get swept up yourself. But if you're aware of this dangerous pattern and resistant to it, you provide a kind of "buffer" for others. The more people who do this, the harder it is for evil to spread. I think of this as **"herd immunity to evil."**


- Revenge fantasy films (like The Equalizer) and those "[Karens Getting Owned](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88CqPl_HqS4)" YouTube videos exist only to stoke our darkness. They are a manifestation of our evil — again, masquerading as our goodness. Notice how they feel _so goddamn righteous._ That's it: that's the feeling.


- "Outrage" can mean (healthy) anger directed at correcting an injustice, but it quickly gets corrupted into self-righteous indignation. Similarly, "judgement" can refer to wise discernment, but it quickly devolves into disdain. Just like "compassion" doesn't really mean "being nice," these words get redefined by our evil so that we make a mess of what is actually quite simple.


- When you fight people using contempt, you can feel your evil allying with theirs. Conversely, when you fight them with compassion, you can feel your inner light allying with theirs. It provides them with the safety to confront their misbehavior while not letting them off the hook for it. Part of them (and of bystanders) can sense what's really happening, and this makes all the difference.


- You know how you can sense when someone is out "looking for trouble" — and how they somehow usually seem to find it? A contemptuous attitude is like that.
