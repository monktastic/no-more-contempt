# Short summary

Many people have the intuition that there are dark forces operating in the world — secretly running the show from behind the scenes, tricking us into fighting each other to distract us. This is much closer to the truth than most of us realize — but not in the way that we may imagine.

If you look carefully enough into your mind while mocking and shaming your enemies, you'll find that part of you secretly _wants_ to see them dig in their heels, so that you are "forced" to escalate. It is serving a part of you that needs to set itself apart from the world; to see itself as different and special. Of course, it doesn't come out and tell you this. It has very clever justifications for why you _must_ behave this way; how you would be shirking your moral responsibility if you _didn't._ Your enemy subconsciously senses your self-deception, which makes them feel compelled to fight back — but since you "don't know" that you're doing this, their recalcitrance proves you right. This is how _all_ evil works: by cleverly hiding itself from our own minds while loudly displaying itself to others, it secretly provokes them into returning the favor, so that we are both none-the-wiser.

On the surface, you and they may be enemies, but under the covers, this aspect of both of you is secretly _allied._ It doesn't matter who your enemies _are_ — everyday Joes across the political aisle, the evil elites, or anyone else — the contempt you feel for them is _only ever_ your darkness secretly conspiring with theirs, to create a darker world in which both of you feel increasingly justified and morally obligated to escalate. The Darkness works beneath our conscious thresholds, effortlessly slithering between minds, behaving like a singular _malevolent distributed entity_ — or perhaps an evil global conspiracy. Any time any one of us skirts our conscience — which is _far_ more often than we realize — we secretly empower it. You can treat this as an allegory, but you can also learn to perceive it clearly and directly. Part of your mind is secretly "in on it." We are all card-carrying members.

This isn't something I can convince you of, because the Darkness is infinitely more clever than I am, and it has access to the deepest layers of your mind. But you can discover it firsthand deep within the crevices of your own mind — and the first time you do, you will be brought to your knees in profound agony and horror. You were listening to the wrong voice all this time, even as you convinced yourself otherwise. Even the most "evil" person is ultimately in the grip of a fiendishly clever parasite that _nobody_ could want if they could see it clearly; almost like a form of Stockholm syndrome. Yet we spend most of our lives gleefully shoving each other into its arms; humanity's ultimate foe; in the name of "good." The more trapped a person is, the more easily their darkness tricks us into shoving them deeper into the abyss while feeling impossibly righteous about doing so. It is the ultimate tragedy.

The **only way** to actually fight evil is to see its true nature; to recognize it as a mental parasite that has cleverly commandeered minds, and to apply the right dose of the right medicine at the right time. It's a skill. Sometimes it can be sweet and gentle, and other times it must be fierce or even [violent](https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/dalai-gun/). It can look like almost anything whatsoever. But regardless of how it manifests, it can be called kindness. All else is unkindness — aka _evil_ — and every action taken from that place makes the world darker, in ways that we aren't conscious of, but that secretly serve our egos. If there is even a trace of malice, contempt (for the _person_), or self-righteousness, then it is unkindness — though it will almost certainly present itself to your mind as the _opposite_ of evil. You have _no idea_ how clever it is.

The world is at a crucial juncture. It seems to be bifurcating into people who recognize this trap and those who are getting lost deeper in it. Of course, to feel any pride in being on the "right" side, or contempt for those on the "wrong" side, is itself to place ourselves on the "wrong" side. In fact, to even _think_ of there being "sides" is to be seduced by the wrong voice. Your enemy isn't ultimately other people; it is the Darkness that is cleverly manipulating _all_ of our minds. May we all awaken to it before we destroy ourselves.
