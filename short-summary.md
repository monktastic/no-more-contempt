Any time you feel self-righteousness or contempt, it is your mind secretly trying to darken the minds of others so that you don't have to confront something in yourself. This makes the world worse.

Each of us has our own perspective on "what's wrong with the world." When we focus on the people responsible, we often feel contempt. We believe that it's there to help us fix the problem, but it's precisely the opposite: contempt is the fuel that powers the engine that encourages others to act in the self-deceptive ways that cause us to feel contempt in the first place.

**Part of us _knows_ that this is the secret purpose of our contempt.** Contempt is therefore _itself_ such an act of self-deception (that encourages others to feel contempt for *us*), whose **only purpose** is to enable us to feel _even more_ contempt. You don't even have to express it directly to your target; merely by harboring it, you ensure that it will somehow leak out into the world and accomplish its sinister goal. This results in a horrifying feedback loop, which all of humanity is trapped in.

This is not merely wild speculation. Everyone who introspects carefully enough eventually discovers it. Until you see the source in your own mind, you cannot understand the true cause of other people's misbehavior, and therefore cannot fix it. You can only encourage *more*. Their misbehavior is enabled (and hidden from their minds) by _precisely_ the same mechanism as your contempt. There is no greater gift you can give the world than healing whatever is causing it.
