What do you see when you look into the eyes of an "evil person"? You probably perceive them as _fundamentally morally defective._ Check if that's true. It's more of a perception or feeling than a conscious belief that we're looking for.

The person doesn't even have to be Hitler. See if you feel a mild version of this when thinking about, say, your political opponents. This perception naturally leads to _contempt._

It probably feels like the contempt is there to help you "fight evil," but this is a sinister lie. It is actually preparing your mind to license itself to engage in some sort of behavior that goes against your conscience — your very deepest sense of right and wrong. You would normally never go against it, but your contempt always finds some clever way around this.

In particular, it will license you to do something that elevates or otherwise enriches yourself at the world's expense — but you will not (consciously) recognize the harm you are causing. It will feel not just okay, but positively _righteous_. It isn't until much later (if ever) that you will realize how badly you hoodwinked yourself.

This is precisely what is going on in the minds of the "evil people"; the very thing that you perceive as a moral defect. Now they will see _you_ as evil for exactly the same reason that you did them. Far from being a bad thing, this is exactly what they wanted: reassurance that the people they're harming actually deserve it. Now they don't have to work as hard at hiding it from their conscience.

And how will that look to you? Evil, of course. Mission accomplished: you now get to feel self-righteous about having pushed someone further into the dark. Obviously you don't consciously feel that you did any such thing. If they dug in their heels, that's on them. After all, any decent person would have introspected and repented. But this is exactly the lie: whatever caused you to feel contempt knew _exactly_ how to press their buttons so as to maximize the chance of this outcome.

If you don't believe me, that's perfect: you're getting a taste of just how hard it is to detect this self-deception in yourself. It is all the harder for the "bad people" — _and your contempt is carefully designed precisely to make it even harder_. That's what it's there for.

There is something that lives in all of our minds — call it a parasite — that causes this behavior. The first sign it is operating is that you perceive others as _fundamentally defective_ in some way. That's exactly the feeling that is fostered to allow for genocides and other atrocities. And it is operating in you right now.

Now for the shocker: our parasite isn't limited to our individual mind. Each of ours is more like a limb of a "distributed malevolent entity" that is continually manipulating _all_ of our minds. When you see someone as _bad_, a kind of secret handshake takes place between your parasites. They are subconsciously exchanging information that will teach them how to convince you to hand more power over to them.

This isn't just a wacky hypothesis or metaphor: you can actually learn to see it directly. The whole world is caught in its terrible sway. We are facing a nemesis that is infinitely more clever than we are willing to believe — and each one of us is _protecting_ our portion of it out of a misguided sense of righteousness. It is the **perfect** trap, and we keep falling for it.

Every "evil conspiracy" that exists out there (some of which must surely be real) ultimately filters up to this one — one that your own mind is secretly in on. Every single time you feel contempt, malice, or even just self-righteousness, you are feeding the Beast. You have a duty to do something about this.

Yes, you have a duty to fight the evil "out there" — but you must first see that this is impossible without dealing with the hidden evil "in here." If you don't, then every single thing you thin you're doing to "fight evil" is secretly strengthening it.

It is only once you see how easily you've been seduced that you begin to understand what's happening in the "bad people." And only then can you do anything genuinely useful about it.

This is called compassion. It's not about being nice. It can be as fierce — or even violent — as the situation warrants. But it will be completely free of the misperception that you are in any way fundamentally better than anyone. It feels _completely_ different. You  actually begin to perceive the parasite within people's minds, and how your compassion weakens it, instead of strengthening it like we normally do.
