Nobody _wants_ to be depressed. Or rather, people may act like they do, and even say that they do — in which case it is probably kindest to believe them — but the very deepest aspect of their mind simply _couldn't_ want such a thing if it could see clearly what it was choosing. A person may recognize this only after being free of it, and look back on it like a bizarre dream.

It wasn't until recently that empathy for depression became a social norm. Until then, contempt seemed to many like a perfectly healthy response, and sympathy was equated with coddling. Today, we know it's more nuanced: depending on the person and situation, either firmness or gentleness may be appropriate — but in neither case does an underlying attitude of contempt help anything.

Advances in neuroscience certainly helped drive this cultural shift, but were they really necessary? Once we knew that brains and genes were a thing, did we really need to know the exact details to feel empathy for the depressed? Did anyone ever doubt that it had _some_ physiological basis? Anyone "with the eyes to see" could directly perceive that contempt was the wrong approach. It served only to make the attacker feel superior, and it was harmful.

The same is true for alcoholism, addiction, obesity, and countless other conditions. It seems we have to re-learn the same lesson each time, using new science as justification — but it is always possible to see that the deepest aspect of our mind simply couldn't want to suffer. This "empathy shortcut" makes it clear that contempt makes zero sense in such situations. Our descendants will surely wonder how this wasn't obvious from the start.

What may be harder to see is that the base layer of our mind also doesn't want _others_ to suffer. People certainly act like they want this, and even sometimes say that they do — in which case it is dangerously naive not to believe them — but something surprisingly similar is going on beneath the surface. Their confused state is generated by a haze of profound delusion that will horrify them should they manage to break free of it. I do not have the neuroscience to prove this to you (yet), but it is plain for anyone with the eyes to see. It is not merely a belief.

Contempt for "bad people" makes zero sense for exactly the same reason as before: it merely compounds the delusion that's causing the problem to begin with. They are simply under the sway of a different form of mental illness. Our contempt doesn't exist to help anyone; it just helps us feel superior. The very deepest part of us knows this, but that knowledge somehow isn't reaching our conscious awareness.

Social norms have largely (and thankfully) robbed us of our ability to feel superior when treating mentally ill people (or mentally retarded people, or those with different skin color, ...) with contempt. People who do that are rightfully seen as wrong in the head themselves. But then we turn right around and treat _them_ with contempt — unable to see that we are repeating the same fundamental mistake.

If you don't yet have the "eyes to see" this, then it may sound hopelessly naive. But the truth is that the very deepest layer of your mind _cannot want to feel contempt for **anyone**_. If you could clearly see the choice you were making, you wouldn't make it. It is only tempting when in the grip of profound delusion. You may *say* that you want it, and deeply believe that it's helpful, but there will (hopefully) come a time when you are horrified by this confusion.

Just like you can't talk people out of depression, addiction, or evil, I can't talk you out of contempt[^talk-you-out]. Something must be _seen_.

---

Now, an important clarification: in the same way that we might need to be firm with someone with mental illness, we may need to be even more firm — perhaps even violent[^dalai-lama-gun] — with people who "want" to cause harm. Our response may even *look* like contempt. But *genuine* contempt comes from a completely different source; a deeply malicious one. They should not be confused.

It can be very hard to see how this change in motivation makes any difference. After all, violence is violence, right? But it's not. People are _ridiculously_ sensitive to our intentions, and malice generates very different long-term consequences than benevolence. This difference may not be obvious from the immediate (or even second- or third-order) effects, but again, it is visible to those with eyes to see.

When all desire for harm (for oneself and others) is eliminated from the mind, what remains isn't apathy or neutrality. Surprisingly, it is an impossibly fierce and uncompromising love for the world — one that is able to deal with all kinds of situations in a healthy way[^jesus].

My hope for humanity is that we discover this. I believe our very existence depends on it.

> _Be kind, for everyone you meet is fighting a great battle._ —Author unknown

It is easy to be kind to someone when we can see that they're trying. Otherwise, we have two options: find some part of them that _is_ trying and be kind to it, or else be unkind to their whole being. The latter is contempt, and it is lazy and harmful. There is literally _always_ a part that is trying.

Consider depression. Nobody _wants_ to be depressed. Or rather, people may _act_ like they do, and even _say_ that they do — in which case it is probably kindest to believe them — but the very deepest aspect of their mind simply _couldn't_ want such a thing, if it could see clearly what it was choosing. A person may recognize this only after being free of it, and look back on it like a bizarre dream.

It wasn't until recently that empathy for the depressed became a social norm. Until then, contempt seemed to many like a perfectly healthy response, and sympathy was equated with coddling. Today, we know better: depending on the person and situation, either firmness or gentleness may be appropriate, but in neither case does an underlying attitude of contempt help anything. The justification that "coddling is bad, so cruelty is good" is clearly self-serving nonsense: it is an excuse for our dark tendencies.

Advances in neuroscience certainly helped drive this cultural shift, but were they really necessary? Once we knew that brains and genes were a thing, did we really need to know the exact details to see that empathy was right? Did anyone ever doubt that depression had _some_ physiological basis? Anyone "with the eyes to see" could directly perceive that contempt was the wrong approach without waiting for proof.

The same is true for alcoholism, addiction, obesity, and countless other conditions. It seems we have to re-learn the same lesson each time, using new science as justification — even though it is always possible to see that the deepest aspect of people's minds simply couldn't want to suffer. This "empathy shortcut" makes it clear that contempt makes zero sense in such situations. "Tough love" may still be required, but it is still a form of love, not contempt — and the deepest aspect of *our* mind knows the difference. Our descendants will surely wonder how we ever overlooked it.

What may be harder to see is that this "base layer of mind" also doesn't want _others_ to suffer. People certainly act like they do, and even sometimes say that they do — in which case it is dangerously naive not to believe them — but something surprisingly similar is going on beneath the surface. Their confused state is generated by a haze of profound delusion that would horrify them should they manage to break free of it. I do not have the neuroscience to prove this to you (yet), but it is plain for anyone with the eyes to see. It is not merely a belief.

Contempt for "perpetrators" is bad for exactly the same reason as for "victims": it merely compounds the delusion that's causing the problem to begin with. It is a more cleverly disguised form of mental illness. The very deepest part of us knows this, but that knowledge somehow isn't reaching our conscious awareness.

Social norms have largely robbed us of our ability to feel superior when treating mentally ill people (or mentally retarded people, or those with different skin color, ...) with contempt. People who do that are rightfully seen as wrong in the head themselves. But then we turn right around and treat _them_ with contempt — unable to see that we are repeating the same fundamental mistake.

If you don't yet have "the eyes to see" this, then compassion for evildoers may sound hopelessly naive. But if so, then I contend that your mind is still under the grip of a powerful delusion. You may *say* that contempt is more helpful — and even believe it — but there will (hopefully) come a time when you are horrified by this confusion. The very deepest layer of your mind cannot want to feel contempt for **anyone**. If you could clearly see the choice you were making, you wouldn't make it.

Alas, just like we can't talk people out of depression, addiction, or evil, I can't talk you out of contempt[^talk-you-out]. There is something that must be _seen_.

Now, an important clarification must be made: in the same way that we might need to be firm with the mentally ill, we may need to be even more firm — perhaps even violent[^dalai-lama-gun] — with people who "want" to cause harm. Such a response may even *look* like contempt. But *genuine* contempt comes from a completely different source; a deeply malicious one. The two should not be confused[^confusion].

We know that being kind is the "right thing to do" in general, but things get hazy when it comes to "bad" people. Not only is it hard to be kind to them, but it's a bit unclear _why_ and even _whether_ we should. At the same time, there are many people who seem to be "bad" enough for this question to be directly relevant to us. They may not deserve our cruelty (yet), but they surely deserve our contempt. It feels like the _least_ we could do as decent people.

But what if there _is_ a sense in which kindness (properly defined) is _always_ the right thing to do, and our "innocent" deviation from it is responsible for tremendously more suffering than we realize?

Contempt is hard to define, but here's a rough starting point: it's the feeling that someone is worthless or beneath consideration — often accompanied by a desire to make sure they know it. It is the sense that they are fundamentally defective (in the case of "bad people," fundamentally _morally_ defective). We generally want the best for people, even when they mess up. With contempt, this desire evaporates, and may even be replaced with malice. It often starts off much milder, with subtle feelings of suspicion and uncharitability. But these turn out to be self-reinforcing, as we shall see.

Before we begin, what is contempt? It is easier to describe than define.

Imagine you are debating politics with someone whom you at first trust is well-intentioned. Slowly, as their position is revealed, you begin to doubt their intentions. Eventually, you become convinced that they could only believe these things if they were _fundamentally morally defective_.

It is this _fundamental-ness_ that is the defining characteristic of contempt, whether the defect itself is moral or not. Genocides are carried out when people believe their victims are _fundamentally_ sub-human[^genocide] (and not merely humans with "worse" religions or ethnicities). While our own contempt may not rise to the level of enabling atrocities — yet — it is a milder form of the same phenomenon. In this dark place, all goodwill is lost.

Mocking our political enemies is fun because we get to see them hurt, quite independently of whether the behavior is a net good — though of course we must tell ourselves that it is one. Our "victim" cannot be fixed, so it is only right to punish them — and what more humane way to punish someone than to subtly communicate, through our eyes and voice, how worthless they are? That is how it usually starts, but rarely how it ends.

The feeling can also be much more subtle and brief, as when we mutter "idiot" under our breath at a bad driver. But if left unchecked, this attitude becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy. Perhaps a part of us secretly _wants_ that...

Before we begin, what is contempt? It is easier to describe than define.

Consider how most of us seem to feel about our political opponents these days. They don't just have bad ideas; they seem _defective_ in some fundamental way. How else could they believe the ridiculous things they do (or claim to, anyway)? This _fundamental-ness_ is a defining characteristic of contempt; we are fundamentally better people than they are.

Genocides can only be carried out when people believe their victims are sub-human. It's not sufficient for them to be humans with "worse" religions or ethnicities; they must be something... _less_[^genocide]. While our own contempt may not rise to the level of enabling atrocities — yet — it is a milder form of the same phenomenon. 

In this dark place, all goodwill is lost.

Before we begin, what is contempt? It is easier to describe than define.

Consider how most of us seem to feel about our political opponents these days. They don't just have bad ideas; they seem _defective_ in some fundamental way. How else could they believe the ridiculous things they do (or claim to, anyway)? This _fundamental-ness_ is a defining characteristic of contempt; we are fundamentally better people than they are.

Genocides can only be carried out when people believe their victims are sub-human. It's not sufficient for them to be humans with "worse" religions or ethnicities; they must be something... _less_[^genocide]. While our own contempt may not rise to the level of enabling atrocities — yet — it is a milder form of the same phenomenon. 

In this dark place, all goodwill is lost. 

Mocking our political enemies is "innocent" fun, because we get to see bad people get hurt. This enjoyment is quite independent of whether our behavior somehow makes a positive difference in the world — though, of course, we must _tell_ ourselves that it does. Our "victim" cannot be fixed, so it is only right to punish them — and what more humane way than to subtly communicate, through our eyes and voice, how worthless they are? That is how it usually starts, but rarely how it ends.

The feeling can also be much more subtle and brief, as when we mutter "idiot" under our breath at a bad driver, or even just suspicion and uncharitability toward a dialogue partner. But if left unchecked, this attitude becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy. And when _all_ of us are doing that, well... the result is bad, as we shall see.

> _Be kind, for everyone you meet is fighting a great battle._ —Author unknown

Contempt has become a popular attitude to take with those who we feel are responsible for the world's ills. It feels like a healthy way to affirm our values, communicate our anger, and deter others from similar misbehavior.

But contempt[^contempt] actually has a profoundly unhealthy origin and produces far-ranging toxic effects that are not only invisible to us, but are actually _hidden_ from us by our own minds. The aggregate result of everyone doing this is a world in which the problems we bemoan are all but inevitable.

This explains why the US is headed toward civil war while nobody recognizes their own complicity. The fault always seems to lie entirely with the other side, or perhaps with the evil elites who are playing both sides. Whatever their role, there is something going on within our own minds that we're not seeing.

It is imperative that we discover this trick by which our mind hides the true source and effects of our behavior — not only for our own sake, but the world's. When this is seen clearly, the problems of the world — and their solutions — begin to look radically different.

---

> _If only it were all so simple! If only there were evil people somewhere insidiously committing evil deeds, and it were necessary only to separate them from the rest of us and destroy them. But the line dividing good and evil cuts through the heart of every human being. And who is willing to destroy a piece of his own heart?_ —Alexander Solzhenitsyn

> _And no wonder, for even Satan masquerades as an angel of light. So it is not strange that his ministers also masquerade as ministers of righteousness._ —2 Corinthians 11:14

We've all done something wrong while convincing ourselves that it's not. What we may not realize is that _all_ evil ultimately depends on this very mechanism of self-deception. We are motivated _not_ to see this, because that lets us believe that we are fundamentally different from the "bad people." We treat them with contempt to bait them into behaving in ways that confirm our moral superiority.

Unfortunately, baiting people into more evil is hardly "morally superior," so we must carefully hide our true motivation from ourselves. We call it "fighting evil." This is *itself* an act of self-deception — and perhaps the hardest one to detect, because it feels so righteously motivated. But seeing how your mind hides this truth is key to understanding how the "bad people" do what _they_ do without feeling bad.

Once you see this, everything changes.

You discover that there is darkness within each of us. It is not _intrinsic_ to our minds[^intrinsic], but is more like a parasite. It knows that we are only willing to harm people who we deem _subhuman_[^subhuman], so it does something very clever: it alters our perception such that we _see_ some people's darkness as intrinsic to their minds; we see them as _fundamentally_ bad in a way that we could never be. This way, we are free to be malicious without compunction.

Consciously, we don't realize that we're being manipulated by our darkness; it feels like we're expressing a natural and healthy instinct to violently attack evil — which we now equate with attacking _people_, since we can no longer distinguish the two. But no matter how subdued our attack (e.g., mockery), our underlying malicious intent makes us appear evil to them for exactly the same reason that they appear evil to us.

This has the effect of driving their darkness deeper into their minds, making it appear even _more_ obviously intrinsic, which licenses even more righteous violence from us, resulting in an all-too-familiar downward spiral. But the real shock is discovering that this mutual descent into Hell is secretly being orchestrated by the darkness in _both_ of our minds.

Our darkness tricks us into behaving in ways that it knows will convince others that we are evil, because it knows exactly how their darkness behaves — _because ours and theirs are fundamentally identical_. In fact, they are not just identical, but are more like outgrowths of a single shared "shadowy presence" that continually manipulates all of our minds; the _Devil_, if you will.

This is not just a wacky religious invention: it seems that everyone who introspects carefully enough eventually perceives this "distributed malevolent entity" with a kind of intelligence and volition of its own that, even if not _literally_ true, explain its seemingly-coordinated behavior terrifyingly well. _This_ is our true enemy; not other people (though fighting it sometimes requires fighting them). 

It is that primordial "evil global conspiracy" to which all the rest ultimately owe their existence. Every attempt to maliciously subdue it "out there" just strengthens it, because such behavior is only ever initiated _by_ it, even though it makes us believe that it was initiated by us. Contempt is its most insidious tool precisely because it appears to be the most unmistakably righteous. It is a secret way to leak evil deep into the world, where we can disown all complicity for it.

(To be clear: there may well be groups of particularly "bad" people who conspire to cause great harm, but their existence wouldn't be possible if the rest of us weren't feeding the source — and conversely, it is _inevitable_ given that we are. **We must hold such people accountable**, but when we do this with contempt, we are reinforcing the conditions that effectively _compel_ their existence.)

The only way for humanity to defeat the Devil is to stop falling for its tricks. _Any_ time you feel malice, contempt, or even self-righteousness toward another being; any time you see them as fundamentally defective or inferior; you are being manipulated into spreading evil in some way that you can't see. As you begin to clear up this misperception in your own mind, you discover more of what is causing it in others', which is the only way to do anything genuinely useful about it.

The topic of what such "useful" behavior looks like is vast and beyond the scope of this work, but rest assured that it _can_ be outwardly violent (or mocking) if the circumstances warrant it. It need not take any particular form, and cannot be reduced to principles, except for one: the more deeply it is rooted in compassion — that is, freedom from the above misperception — the more beneficial it tends to be. This is true kindness, and people can sense your profoundly benevolent intent even when you fight them. Being _entirely_ free is enlightenment; perception of our fundamental unity.

Enlightenment is a lofty goal, but we can start small, by changing social norms. And each of us understanding why _contempt is not the way_ seem like a good first step.

## Footnotes

[^contempt]: Specifically, it is contempt for *people* that is wrong. Contempt for ideas or behaviors can actually be healthy.

[^intrinsic]: You may wonder how it is possible to know that evil is not intrinsic to other people's minds, but for our purposes it's more important to see that (1) our _perception_ of their intrinsic defectiveness is our own projection, and (2) our own darkness gives us the capacity to devolve into a condition in which others would be utterly convinced that _ours_ is intrinsic.

[^subhuman]: Notice that genocides can only be perpetrated when the victims are seen as subhuman. The Nazis referred to Jews as 'vermin,' and during the genocide in Rwanda, Tutsis were referred to as 'cockroaches.' This is a common pattern throughout history.

> _Be kind, for everyone you meet is fighting a great battle._ —Author unknown

We each have our own ideas about "what's wrong with the world," and who is responsible. When we think about them, we tend to feel contempt. This seems like a healthy way to affirm our values, convey our disapproval, and deter others from similar misbehavior. In other words, it helps us "fight evil" and save the world.

But what if it is a trap?

Contempt[^contempt] actually has a sinister origin, and produces far-ranging toxic effects that are not only invisible to us, but carefully _hidden_ from us by our own minds. It is not our friend: it fosters conditions in which the problems we bemoan are all but inevitable. At the micro level, this explains bitter divorces in which each side feels like the exclusive victim / hero; and at the macro level, why the US is headed toward civil war despite nobody recognizing their own complicity.

It is imperative that we discover this trick by which our mind hides the true source and effects of our behavior — not only for our own sake, but the world's. When it is fully unveiled, the problems of the world — and their solutions — begin to look radically different.

> _If only it were all so simple! If only there were evil people somewhere insidiously committing evil deeds, and it were necessary only to separate them from the rest of us and destroy them. But the line dividing good and evil cuts through the heart of every human being. And who is willing to destroy a piece of his own heart?_ —Alexander Solzhenitsyn

> _And no wonder, for even Satan masquerades as an angel of light. So it is not strange that his ministers also masquerade as ministers of righteousness._ —2 Corinthians 11:14

We've all done something wrong while convincing ourselves that it isn't. What we may not realize is that _all_ evil ultimately depends on this very mechanism of self-deception. We are motivated _not_ to see this, because then we can believe that we are fundamentally different from the "bad people." _We treat them with contempt to bait them into behaving in ways that license more contempt, to reaffirm our moral superiority._

Unfortunately, such behavior is hardly "morally superior," so we must carefully hide this true motivation from ourselves. We label it "fighting evil," and calculate the ways in which it will actually help the world. This is *itself* an act of self-deception — and perhaps the hardest to detect, because it feels so righteously motivated. But seeing how our mind hides this truth is key to understanding how the "bad people" do what _they_ do without feeling bad.

Once you see this, everything changes.

> _How can you say to your brother, `Let me take the speck out of your eye,' when all the time there is a plank in your own eye? You hypocrite, first take the plank out of your own eye, and then you will see clearly to remove the speck from your brother's eye._ —Matthew 7:4

You discover that there is darkness within each of us. It is not _intrinsic_ to our minds[^intrinsic], but is more like a parasite. It knows that we are only willing to harm people who we deem _subhuman_[^subhuman], so it does something very clever: it alters our perception so that we see some people's darkness as intrinsic to their minds; we see them as _fundamentally_ bad, and therefore subhuman.

Consciously, we don't realize that we're being manipulated by our darkness; it feels like we're expressing a natural and healthy instinct to violently attack evil — which we now equate with attacking _people_, since we can no longer distinguish the two. But no matter how subdued our attack (e.g., mockery), our underlying malicious intent makes _us_ appear evil to them for exactly the same reason that they appear evil to us.

This has the effect of driving their darkness deeper into their minds, making them appear even more "fundamentally" bad, which licenses even more righteous violence from us, resulting in an all-too-familiar downward spiral. But the real shock is discovering that this mutual descent into Hell is secretly being orchestrated by the darkness in _both_ of our minds.

Our darkness tricks us into behaving in ways that it knows will convince others that we are evil, because it knows exactly how their darkness will respond — _because ours and theirs are fundamentally identical_. In fact, they are not just identical, but are more like outgrowths of a single shared "shadowy presence" that continually manipulates all of our minds; the _Devil_, if you will.

This is not just a wacky religious invention: it seems that everyone who introspects carefully enough eventually perceives this "distributed malevolent entity" with a seeming intelligence and volition of its own that, even if not _literally_ true, explain its apparently-coordinated behavior terrifyingly well. 

It is that primordial "evil global conspiracy" to which all the rest ultimately owe their existence. Every attempt to maliciously subdue it "out there" just strengthens it, because such behavior is only ever initiated _by_ it, even though it makes us believe that it was initiated by us.

Our true enemy is not other people, but the parasite in all of our minds. Contempt is nothing but a way to hide that fact from ourselves.

The only way for humanity to defeat the "Devil" is to stop falling for its tricks. _Any_ time you feel malice, contempt, or even self-righteousness toward another being; any time you see them as fundamentally defective or inferior; you are being manipulated into spreading evil in some way that you can't yet see.

> _If only it were all so simple! If only there were evil people somewhere insidiously committing evil deeds, and it were necessary only to separate them from the rest of us and destroy them. But the line dividing good and evil cuts through the heart of every human being._ —Alexander Solzhenitsyn

_tl;dr: The purpose of contempt is to bait people into behavior that confirms our superiority and licenses even more contempt._

Imagine giving someone a dehumanizing stare. It's hard to do, isn't it? It feels evil — because it is. Now imagine that this someone is a "bad person." The worse they are, the more righteous it will feel. Yet it will never look any less evil to them — _because it's not._ And unless they are a saint (which they're not), this will only make them feel _more_ justified in whatever storyline is fueling their misbehavior — because they can now plausibly claim that they are opposing evil.  You will in turn take this as confirmation that _they_ really are evil, and ramp up your dehumanization.

This will result in an all-too-familiar downward spiral. But the big shock is discovering that this is all being orchestrated by a dark aspect within both of your minds. Yours baited theirs, and vice versa. This can all be done subconsciously, through the eyes and tone of voice — no physical violence necessary.

> _And no wonder, for even Satan masquerades as an angel of light._ —2 Corinthians 11:14

You know the classic image of the angel and devil sitting on our shoulders? It's _almost_ accurate, except for two things. First, the angel isn't really external to you, but represents the deepest aspect of your mind. In a profound sense, it *is* you. The devil is external; a kind of parasite[^intrinsic]. But it doesn't just whisper obviously-bad ideas in your ear; it alters your very perception such that evil feels unmistakably righteous. It pretends to _be_ you / your angel. If it does its job well, you won't even feel like you _have_ a devil — at least, not in the way that _bad_ people do.

One of its tricks is to make other people appear subhuman, so that harming them feels okay[^subhuman]. Your morals (and social norms) act as a kind of buffer, so that it can't do this openly with most people. But it's always on the hunt for victims, and it only needs the slightest provocation to begin its manipulation.

> _Be kind, for everyone you meet is fighting a great battle._ —Author unknown

It searches for people whose misbehavior can't be chalked up to a "great battle." Your angel knows that if you look deeply enough, you will _always_ find a kind of battle — and that even though this won't condone their sins, it will prevent you from hating them. So your devil does something clever: it makes you perceive their devil as _intrinsic_ to their minds. You will then see them as _fundamentally defective_ — and therefore subhuman. There is no need to look for any "battle."

This is the wedge it uses to prevent your angel from getting a solid grip. And the nature of _their_ devil is such that you will both rapidly accelerate away from any possibility of mutual humanizing. Both yours and theirs _knew_ this would happen, because they are fundamentally identical. In fact, not only are they identical, but with enough subtlety of perception, you may notice that they act more like puppets of a single _shared_ Devil that is currently flowing freely through humanity.

This is not just a wacky religious invention: it seems that everyone who introspects carefully enough eventually perceives this "distributed malevolent entity" with a seeming intelligence and volition of its own that, even if not _literally_ true, explain its apparently-coordinated behavior terrifyingly well. Your interaction isn't limited to the two of you: it ripples out from each of you into your lives, eventually reaching the far corners of the world.

It is that primordial "evil global conspiracy" to which all the rest ultimately owe their existence. Every attempt to maliciously subdue it "out there" just strengthens it, because such behavior is only ever initiated _by_ it, even though it makes us believe that it was initiated by us. Contempt is its most insidious tool precisely because it appears to be the most unmistakably righteous. It is a secret way to leak evil deep into the world, where we can disown all complicity for it.

(To be clear: there may well be groups of particularly "bad" people who conspire to cause great harm, but their existence wouldn't be possible if the rest of us weren't feeding the source — and conversely, it is _inevitable_ given that we are. **We must hold such people accountable**, but when we do this with contempt, we are reinforcing the conditions that effectively _compel_ their existence.)

Our true enemy is not other people, but the parasite manipulating _all_ of our minds. The greatest gift you can give the world is returning to your "angel"; the only thing that can truly evict the "devil." This "angel" is not weak, and it's not always nice. It can do whatever is required to defeat evil. The only thing it never does is fall into that dark state of mind where it _pretends_ to be doing good while secretly causing mayhem.

_Any_ time you feel malice, contempt, or even self-righteousness toward another being; any time you see them as fundamentally defective or inferior; you are being manipulated into spreading evil in some way that you can't yet see. It is only by clearing up this misperception in your own mind that you begin to see what is causing it in others' — and thereby become able to do something genuinely useful about it.

This is called compassion[^compassion]. It doesn't always know what the most beneficial behavior is. That requires _wisdom_. It only ensures that you are, indeed, behaving in a way that is truly aligned with your deepest values; your profound love for the world. Developing wisdom is a vast topic, and beyond the scope of this work.

When compassion is developed to its full extent, it reveals the vast interconnectedness not only of humanity, but of all of reality. From here, malice and contempt are literally impossible. This is something that is only fully seen upon enlightenment — but we can all sense it to a greater or lesser degree at all times. 

Enlightenment is a lofty goal, but we can start small, by changing social norms. Contempt for "bad people" is the most insidious, and must go the way of all other forms of hatred if we are to survive.

It is that primordial "evil global conspiracy;" the one to which all the rest ultimately owe their existence. Every attempt to maliciously subdue it "out there" just strengthens it, because such behavior is only ever initiated _by_ it — though it makes us believe it was our (righteous) idea. Contempt is a form of self-deception, and like all others, it secretly invites more self-deception in others. It opens up that shadowy space of mind in which evil can be "safely" committed. This ripples out to the far corners of the globe, where we can plausibly deny any connection to it.

To be clear: there may well be groups of particularly "bad" people who conspire to cause great harm, but their existence wouldn't be possible if the rest of us weren't feeding the source — and conversely, it is _inevitable_ given that we are. **We must hold such people accountable** — but when we do this with contempt, we are reinforcing the conditions that effectively _compel_ their existence.

This is something that is only fully seen upon enlightenment — but [we can all sense it](unity.md) to a greater or lesser degree at all times. 

Enlightenment is a lofty goal, but we can start small, by changing social norms. We can teach our children (and remind our allies) that contempt for "bad people" isn't at all what it seems to be. It must go the way of all other forms of evil if we are to defeat our true enemy.

## Footnotes

[^contempt]: Specifically, it is contempt for *people* that is wrong. Contempt for ideas or behaviors can actually be healthy.

[^intrinsic]: You may wonder how it is possible to know that evil is not intrinsic to other people's minds, but for our purposes it's more important to see that (1) our _perception_ of their intrinsic defectiveness is our own projection, and (2) our own darkness gives us the capacity to devolve into a condition in which others would be utterly convinced that _ours_ is intrinsic.

[^subhuman]: Notice that genocides can only be perpetrated when the victims are seen as subhuman. The Nazis referred to Jews as 'vermin,' and during the genocide in Rwanda, Tutsis were referred to as 'cockroaches.' This is a common pattern throughout history.

[^compassion]: You could say that everything comes down to distinguishing when we're being malicious in the name of good vs compassionate in a way that necessitates harm. People can sense the difference, even when we think they can't.

We each have our own ideas about "what's wrong with the world," and who is responsible. When we think about them, we tend to feel contempt. It seems like a healthy way to affirm our values, convey our disapproval, and deter others from similar misbehavior — in other words, it helps us "fight evil" and save the world.

But what if it is a trap?

Contempt[^contempt] actually has a sinister origin, and produces far-ranging toxic effects that are not only invisible to us, but carefully _hidden_ from us by our own minds. It fosters the very conditions in which the problems we decry are all but inevitable. At the micro level, it results in bitter divorces in which each side feels like the exclusive victim / hero; and at the macro level, it explains why the US is headed toward civil war despite nobody recognizing their own complicity. On an even greater scale, it explains that archetypal "evil global conspiracy" that captures our imagination.

It is imperative that we discover this trick by which our mind hides the true source and effects of our behavior — not only for our own sake, but the world's. When it is fully unveiled, the problems of the world — and their solutions — begin to look radically different.

---

_tl;dr: The purpose of contempt is to bait people into behavior that licenses even more contempt. We do this to reassure ourselves that evil doesn't exist in our own minds, but only other people's. The result is a world in which "evil forces" seemingly conspire against us, and we never suspect the truth: that we've always been in on the conspiracy. The central tools we use to fight it — contempt, malice, etc. — are precisely what empower it._

> _If only it were all so simple! If only there were evil people somewhere insidiously committing evil deeds, and it were necessary only to separate them from the rest of us and destroy them. But the line dividing good and evil cuts through the heart of every human being._ —Alexander Solzhenitsyn

Imagine giving someone a dehumanizing stare. It's hard to do, isn't it? It feels evil — because it is. Now imagine that this someone is a "bad person." The worse they are, the more righteous it will feel. Yet it will never look any less evil to them — _because it's not._ And unless they are a saint (which they're not), this will only make them feel _more_ justified in whatever storyline is fueling their misbehavior — because they can now plausibly claim that they are opposing evil.  You will in turn take this as confirmation that _they_ really are evil and ramp up your dehumanization.

The world will now rapidly become darker, in an all-too-familiar downward spiral. But the big shock is discovering that this was all orchestrated by a dark aspect within _both_ of your minds: yours baited theirs, and vice versa. This didn't even require physical violence; it could all be done subconsciously, through the eyes and tone of voice.

> _And no wonder, for even Satan masquerades as an angel of light._ —2 Corinthians 11:14

You know the classic image of the angel and devil sitting on our shoulders? It's _almost_ accurate, except for two things. First, the angel isn't really external to you, but represents the deepest aspect of your mind; your profound love for the world. In a deep sense, it *is* you. The devil is external; a kind of parasite[^intrinsic]. But it doesn't just whisper obviously-bad ideas in your ear; it pretends to *be* you, and alters your very perception so that certain evils appear unerringly righteous. The more successful it is, the less you will believe that you even have one — at least, in the same way that "bad people" do.

One of its tricks is to make some people appear subhuman, so that harming them feels okay[^subhuman]. Your morals (and social norms) act as a kind of buffer, preventing you from seeing most people this way. But it's always on the hunt for victims, and it only needs the slightest provocation to begin its manipulation.

> _Be kind, for everyone you meet is fighting a great battle._ —Author unknown

It searches for people whose misbehavior can't be chalked up to any kind of "great battle." Your angel knows that if you look deeply enough, you will _always_ find a kind of battle — and that this will prevent you from hating them, even if you must fight them. So your devil does something clever: it makes you perceive their devil as _intrinsic_ to their minds. You will then see them as _fundamentally bad_ or _defective_ — and therefore subhuman.

This is the wedge it uses to prevent your angel from getting an empathetic grip. This triggers behavior that will cause you both to rapidly accelerate away from any possibility of mutual humanizing. Both your devil and theirs and theirs _knew_ this would happen, because they are fundamentally identical. In fact, not only are they identical, but in a certain sense they behave more like puppets of a single shared Devil that is pulling _all_ of our strings.

This is not just a religious invention: it seems that everyone who introspects carefully enough eventually perceives this "distributed malevolent entity" with a seeming intelligence and volition of its own that, even if not _literally_ true, explain its apparently-coordinated behavior terrifyingly well. Your interaction isn't limited to the two of you: it ripples out from each of you into your lives, eventually reaching the far corners of the world.

<p align="center" width="100%">
    <img width="33%" src="img/shared-devil.png "> 
</p>

It is that primordial "evil global conspiracy;" the one to which all the rest ultimately owe their existence. Every attempt to maliciously subdue it "out there" just strengthens it, because such behavior is only ever initiated _by_ it — though it makes us believe it was our (righteous) idea. Contempt is a form of self-deception, and like all others, it secretly invites more self-deception in others. It opens up that shadowy space of mind in which evil can be "safely" committed. This ripples out to the far corners of the globe, where we can plausibly deny any connection to it.

To be clear: there may well be groups of particularly "bad" people who conspire to cause great harm, but their existence wouldn't be possible if the rest of us weren't feeding the source — and conversely, it is _inevitable_ given that we are. **We must hold such people accountable** — but when we do this with contempt, we are reinforcing the conditions that effectively _compel_ their existence.

Our true enemy is not other people, but the parasite manipulating _all_ of our minds. The greatest gift you can give the world is healing yourself of it. This returns you to your "angel"; the only thing that can truly evict anyone's "devil." This "angel" is not weak, and it's not always nice. It can do whatever is required to defeat evil. The only thing it never does is lead you into that illusion from which you _pretend_ to be doing good while secretly causing mayhem.

_Any_ time you feel malice, contempt, or even self-righteousness toward another being; any time you see them as fundamentally defective or inferior; you are being manipulated into spreading evil in some way that you can't yet see. It is only by clearing up this misperception in your own mind that you begin to see what is causing it in others' — and thereby become able to do anything genuinely useful about it.

This is called compassion[^compassion]. It doesn't always know what the most beneficial behavior is. That requires _wisdom_. It only ensures that you are, indeed, behaving in a way that is aligned with your deepest values; your profound love for the world. Developing wisdom is a vast topic, and beyond the scope of this work.

When compassion is developed to its full extent, it reveals the vast interconnectedness not only of humanity, but of all of reality. From here, malice and contempt are literally impossible. This is something that is only fully seen upon enlightenment — but [we can all sense it](unity.md) to a greater or lesser degree at all times. 

Enlightenment is a lofty goal, but we can start small, by changing social norms. We can teach our children (and remind our allies) that contempt for "bad people" isn't at all what it seems to be. It must go the way of all other forms of evil if we are to defeat our true enemy.

## Footnotes

[^contempt]: Specifically, it is contempt for *people* that is wrong. Contempt for ideas or behaviors can actually be healthy.

[^intrinsic]: You may wonder how it is possible to know that evil is not intrinsic to other people's minds, but for our purposes it's more important to see that (1) our _perception_ of their intrinsic defectiveness is our own projection, and (2) our own darkness gives us the capacity to devolve into a condition in which others would be utterly convinced that _ours_ is intrinsic.

[^subhuman]: Notice that genocides can only be perpetrated when the victims are seen as subhuman. The Nazis referred to Jews as 'vermin,' and during the genocide in Rwanda, Tutsis were referred to as 'cockroaches.' This is a common pattern throughout history.

[^compassion]: You could say that everything comes down to distinguishing when we're being malicious in the name of good vs compassionate in a way that necessitates harm. People can sense the difference, even when we think they can't.

[^dalai-lama-gun]: The Dalai Lama was once asked what you should do if a gunman is trying to shoot you and you have a gun. [He said "shoot back."](https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/dalai-gun/)

We each have our own ideas about "what's wrong with the world," and who is responsible. When we think about them, we tend to feel contempt. It seems like a healthy way to affirm our values, convey our disapproval, and deter others from similar misbehavior — in other words, it helps us "fight evil" and save the world.

But what if it is a trap?

Contempt[^contempt] actually has a sinister origin, and produces far-ranging toxic effects that are not only invisible to us, but carefully _hidden_ from us by our own minds. It fosters the very conditions in which the problems we decry are all but inevitable. At the micro level, it results in bitter divorces in which each side feels like the exclusive victim / hero; and at the macro level, it explains why the US is headed toward civil war despite nobody recognizing their own complicity. On an even greater scale, it begins to look like that archetypal "evil global conspiracy" that captures our collective imagination.

It is imperative that we discover this trick by which our mind hides the true source and effects of our behavior — not only for our own sake, but the world's. When it is fully unveiled, the problems of the world — and their solutions — begin to look radically different.

---

_tl;dr: The purpose of contempt is to bait people into behavior that licenses even more contempt. We do this to reassure ourselves that evil doesn't exist in our own minds, but only other people's. The result is a world in which "evil forces" seemingly conspire against us, while we never suspect the truth: that we've always been in on the conspiracy. The central tools we use to fight it — contempt, malice, etc. — are precisely what empower it._

> _If only it were all so simple! If only there were evil people somewhere insidiously committing evil deeds, and it were necessary only to separate them from the rest of us and destroy them. But the line dividing good and evil cuts through the heart of every human being._ —Alexander Solzhenitsyn

Imagine giving someone a dehumanizing stare. It's hard to do, isn't it? It feels evil — because it is. Now imagine that this someone is a "bad person." The worse they are, the more righteous it will feel. Yet it will never look any less evil to them — _because it's not._ And unless they are a saint (which they're not), this will only make them feel _more_ justified in whatever storyline is fueling their misbehavior — because they can now plausibly claim that they are opposing evil.  You will in turn take this as confirmation that _they_ really are evil and intensify your dehumanization.

The world will rapidly become darker, resulting in an all-too-familiar downward spiral. But the big shock is discovering that this was all orchestrated by a dark aspect within _both_ of your minds: yours baited theirs, and vice versa. It didn't even require physical violence; it could all be accomplished subconsciously, through the eyes and tone of voice.

> _And no wonder, for even Satan masquerades as an angel of light._ —2 Corinthians 11:14

You know the classic image of the angel and devil sitting on our shoulders? It's _almost_ accurate, except for two things. First, the angel isn't really external to you, but represents the deepest aspect of your mind; your profound love for the world. In a deep sense, it *is* you. The devil is external; a kind of parasite[^intrinsic]. But it doesn't just whisper obviously-bad ideas in your ear; it pretends to be your inner angel, and alters your very perception so that certain evils appear unerringly righteous. The more successful it is, the less you will believe that you even _have_ a devil — at least, in the same way that "bad people" do.

<p align="center" width="100%">
    <img width="33%" src="img/parasite.png "> 
</p>

One of its tricks is to make some people appear subhuman, so that harming them feels okay[^subhuman]. Your morals (and social norms) act as a kind of buffer, preventing you from seeing most people this way. But it's always on the hunt for victims, and it only needs the slightest excuse to begin its manipulation.

> _Be kind, for everyone you meet is fighting a great battle._ —Author unknown

It searches for people whose misbehavior can't be chalked up to any kind of "great battle." Your angel knows that if you look deeply enough, you will _always_ find a kind of battle — and that this will prevent you from hating them, even if you must fight them. So your devil does something clever: it makes you perceive their devil as _intrinsic_ to their minds. You will then see them as _fundamentally bad_ or _defective_ — and therefore subhuman and worthy of harm.

This is the wedge it drives to prevent your angel from getting an empathetic grip. It triggers behavior that will cause you both to rapidly accelerate away from any possibility of mutual humanizing. Both your devil and theirs and theirs _knew_ this would happen, because they are fundamentally identical. In fact, not only are they identical, but from a certain perspective they behave more like puppets of a single shared Devil that is pulling _all_ of our strings.

This is not just a religious invention: it seems that everyone who introspects carefully enough eventually perceives this "distributed malevolent entity" with a seeming intelligence and volition of its own that, even if not _literally_ true, explain its apparently-coordinated behavior terrifyingly well. Your interaction with the "bad person" ripples out from each of you into your lives, eventually reaching the far corners of the world — where you can plausibly deny any connection to it.

<p align="center" width="100%">
    <img width="33%" src="img/shared-devil.png "> 
</p>

It is that primordial "evil global conspiracy;" the one to which all the rest ultimately owe their existence. Every attempt to maliciously subdue it "out there" just strengthens it, because such behavior is only ever initiated _by_ it — though it makes us believe it was our (righteous) idea. Contempt is a form of self-deception, and like all others, it secretly invites more self-deception in others. It invites others into that shadowy space of mind in which evil can be "safely" committed.

To be clear: there may well be groups of particularly "bad" people who conspire to cause great harm, but their existence wouldn't be possible if vast numbers of us weren't continually feeding the source — and conversely, it is _inevitable_ given that we are. **We must hold such people accountable** — but when we do this with contempt, we are reinforcing the conditions that effectively _compel_ their existence.

_Any_ time you feel malice, contempt, or even self-righteousness toward another being; any time you see them as fundamentally defective or inferior; you are being tricked into spreading evil in some way that you can't yet see. Your true enemy isn't other people, but the parasite manipulating _all_ of our minds. The greatest gift you can give the world is healing yourself of it. The more this infection clears up, the more you see how it infects other minds, and the more you can do about it.

This brings you closer to your "angel"; the only thing that can truly evict anyone's "devil." It is not weak, and it's not always nice. It can take any form needed to defeat evil, including violence[^dalai-lama-gun] and even _apparent_ contempt. The one thing it never does is lead you into that illusion from which you _pretend_ to be doing good while secretly causing mayhem.

This is also called compassion[^compassion]. It doesn't always know what the most beneficial behavior is. That requires _wisdom_. Developing wisdom is a vast topic, and beyond the scope of this work. Compassion simply ensures that you are, indeed, behaving in a way that is aligned with your deepest values; your profound love for the world. People can sense your underlying motivation even when you think they can't, and it makes more difference than you can fathom.

This is why wise people urge compassion for evildoers. They aren't suggesting that we be _nice._ They're warning us that the only alternative is being (and spreading) evil in the name of good. The first time you discover this in yourself, you will be brought to your knees in abject agony over the horror that you've been inadvertently been perpetrating on the world.

The more compassion is unveiled, the more it reveals the vast interconnectedness not only of humanity, but of all of reality. This is fully revealed only upon enlightenment — though [we can all sense it](unity.md) to a greater or lesser degree at all times. From here, malice and contempt are literally impossible. The better you understand people's confused minds, the less you can hate them.

Enlightenment is a lofty goal, but we can start small, by changing social norms. We can teach our children (and remind our allies) that contempt for "bad people" isn't what it seems to be. It must go the way of all other forms of evil if we are to defeat our true enemy.

## Radical kindness

When wise people urge compassion for evildoers, they're not suggesting that we be _nice._ They're warning us that the only other option is to be — and spread — _evil_.

Think of compassion and malice as existing on opposite ends of a spectrum. Compassion is our profound love for the world, and can manifest as being pleasant and agreeable (i.e., _nice_), or fierce and even violent, depending on the situation. Malice cares only about causing harm, though it often uses "the greater good" as justification — especially if we fancy ourselves "good people."

The two arise from very different aspects of the mind, but it can be extremely hard to tell them apart: are we harming this person in the genuine service of good, or only in the _name_ of good? Is it an expression of our love, or of our darkest tendencies _masquerading_ as love? Does our intention even matter? After all, harm is harm, right?

No, it's not — and this confusion is precisely what enables evil to creep into the world undetected.

People are _ridiculously_ sensitive to our motivations, and malice makes us appear subtly (or not-so-subtly) evil to them. This triggers exactly the same reaction in "bad people" that their apparent evil does in us: it evokes malice, which makes them look even _more_ evil to us, leading to a downward spiral into Hell. It doesn't require physical violence; it can be kicked off by a dehumanizing gaze.

<p align="center" width="100%">
    <img width="300px" src="img/half-evil.png"> 
</p>

Malicious intent makes us look evil because it _is_: it is secretly designed to darken the world while giving us plausible deniability. We were only "fighting evil" — and how could that ever be wrong? We don't even have to be talking _to_ our target: simply by talking _about_ them with malice, we are inducing hatred in the world in the name of good.

If we could see how dark this really is, we would be unable to do it. It is only possible because we carefully hide the full extent of the _wrongness_ from ourselves. But such self-deception is precisely how "bad people" are able to do what _they_ do: part of them knows perfectly well that what they are doing is wrong, but that _wrongness_ is cleverly hidden from conscious self-reflection.

It is this shadowy state of mind that ultimately enables _all_ evil. If we (the "good people") can't see how easily we are seduced by it, how do we expect them (the "bad people") to? The truth is, we don't.

Our self-image prevents us from admitting that we have anything in common with them, and so instead of recognizing their behavior as self-deceptive — which could actually help them and the world — we perceive them as _fundamentally defective_, so that we can behave maliciously, thus doing our part to keep them trapped in their delusion.

<p align="center" width="100%">
    <img width="300px" src="img/devil-vs-devil.png"> 
</p>

In other words, our very identity as one of the (precious few) "good people" battling the hordes of evil ensures that we subconsciously behave in ways that keep that battle alive. It doesn't even require seeing people as "evil": simply by feeling malice, hatred, contempt, or even self-righteousness, our minds are cleverly plotting a way to darken the world for our (supposed) benefit.

We _must_ stop doing this.

## Angels and Devils

> _And no wonder, for even Satan masquerades as an angel of light._ —2 Corinthians 11:14

You know the classic image of the angel and devil sitting on our shoulders? It's _almost_ accurate, except for two things. First, the angel isn't really external to you, but represents the deepest aspect of your mind; your fundamentally compassionate nature. In a deep sense, it *is* you. The devil is external; a kind of parasite[^intrinsic].

Your angel knows that if you look deeply enough, you will _always_ find a kind of battle — and that this will prevent you from hating them, even if you must fiercely fight them. So your devil does something clever: it makes you perceive their devil as _intrinsic_ to their minds.

## An "evil conspiracy"

This is that primordial "evil global conspiracy"; the one to which all the rest ultimately owe their existence — and _we_ are its secret minions. It isn't being run by a group of people; it lives in *all* of our minds. Every attempt to maliciously subdue it "out there" just strengthens it, because such behavior is only ever initiated _by_ it — though it makes us believe it was our (righteous) idea.

To be clear: there may well be groups of particularly "bad" people who conspire to cause great harm, but their existence wouldn't be possible if vast numbers of us weren't continually tilling the soil of self-deception — and conversely, it is _inevitable_ given that we are. **We must hold such people accountable** — but when we do this with contempt, we are reinforcing the conditions that effectively _compel_ their existence. (And, horrible as it is to admit, something in our minds is doing this _on purpose_, so that we always have someone to point our fingers at.)

<p align="center" width="100%">
    <img width="300px" src="img/evil-conspiracy.png"> 
</p>

_Any_ time you feel malice, contempt, or self-righteousness toward another being; any time you see them as fundamentally defective or inferior; you are being tricked into spreading evil in some way that you can't yet see. These are all forms of self-deception, and secretly invite more self-deception in others — that shadowy space of mind in which evil can be "safely" committed.

Your true enemy isn't other people, but the parasite manipulating _all_ of our minds. The greatest gift you can give the world is healing yourself of it. The more this infection clears up, the more you see how it infects other minds, and the more you can do about it.

The more compassion is unveiled, the more it reveals the vast interconnectedness not only of humanity, but of all of reality. This is fully revealed only upon enlightenment — though [we can all sense it](unity.md) to a greater or lesser degree at all times. From here, malice and contempt are literally impossible.

## Notes

*It is surely the case that some people are so far gone that our fledgling attempts to be compassionate can backfire. This isn't because compassion is the wrong intention, but because we haven't developed it deeply enough yet to be authentic (along with the wisdom to employ it). This is a deep and difficult issue, and beyond the scope of this piece.*

It seems like a healthy way to affirm our values, convey our disapproval, and deter others from similar misbehavior — in other words, to help us "fight evil" and save the world.

> _If only it were all so simple! If only there were evil people somewhere insidiously committing evil deeds, and it were necessary only to separate them from the rest of us and destroy them. But the line dividing good and evil cuts through the heart of every human being. And who is willing to destroy a piece of his own heart?_ —Alexander Solzhenitsyn

We've all done something wrong while convincing ourselves that it's not. What we may not realize is that _all_ evil ultimately depends on this very mechanism of self-deception. We are motivated _not_ to see this, because that lets us believe that we are fundamentally different from the "bad people." We treat them with contempt to bait them into behaving in ways that confirm our moral superiority.

<p align="center" width="100%">
    <img width="300px" src="img/half-evil.png"> 
</p>

Unfortunately, part of us _knows_ that we're doing this, and baiting people into evil  is hardly "morally superior," so we carefully hide it from ourselves. This is *itself* an act of self-deception, and perhaps the hardest one to detect, because it feels so righteously motivated. Seeing how your mind hides this truth is key to understanding how the "bad people" do what _they_ do without feeling bad.

Once you see this, everything changes.

You discover that there is darkness within each of us. It is not intrinsic to our minds, but is more like a parasite. Our darkness knows that we will not harm just anyone, so it does something very clever: it alters our perception such that we _see_ the darkness as intrinsic to some people's minds; we see them as _fundamentally_ bad. This way, we can be malicious without compunction.

<p align="center" width="100%">
    <img width="300px" src="img/parasite.png"> 
</p>

Consciously, we don't realize that we're being manipulated; it feels like we're expressing a natural and healthy instinct to violently attack evil — which we now mistakenly equate with attacking _people_. But no matter how subdued our attack (e.g., mockery), our underlying malicious intent makes us appear evil to them for exactly the same reason that they appear evil to us.

This has the effect of driving their darkness deeper into their minds, making it appear even _more_ surely intrinsic, which inspires even more righteous violence from us, resulting in an all-too-familiar downward spiral. But the real shock is discovering that this mutual descent into Hell is secretly being orchestrated by the darkness in _both_ of our minds.

<p align="center" width="100%">
    <img width="300px" src="img/devil-vs-devil.png"> 
</p>

Our darkness tricks us into behaving in ways that will convince others that ours is intrinsic, because it knows exactly how theirs will respond — _because ours and theirs are identical_. In fact, they are not just identical, but are more like outgrowths of a single shared "shadowy presence" that continually manipulates all of our minds; the _Devil_, if you will.

> _And no wonder, for even Satan masquerades as an angel of light. So it is not strange that his ministers also masquerade as ministers of righteousness._ —2 Corinthians 11:14

This is not just a religious invention: I think that everyone who introspects carefully enough eventually perceives this "distributed malevolent entity" which has a kind of intelligence and volition of its own that, even if not _literally_ true, explain its seemingly-coordinated behavior terrifyingly well. Our true enemy is not other people, but this dark "entity" that has captured our minds.

<p align="center" width="100%">

It is the primordial "evil global conspiracy," to which all the rest ultimately owe their existence. Every attempt to maliciously subdue it "out there" just strengthens it, because such behavior is only ever initiated _by_ it, even though it makes us believe that it was initiated by us. Contempt is its most insidious tool precisely because it appears to be the most unmistakably righteous. It is a secret way to leak evil deep into the world, where we can disown all complicity for it.

To be clear: there may well be groups of particularly "bad" people who conspire to cause great harm, but their existence wouldn't be possible if the rest of us weren't feeding the source — and conversely, it is _inevitable_ given that we are. **We must hold such people accountable**, but when we do this with contempt, we are reinforcing the conditions that effectively _compel_ their existence.

<p align="center" width="100%">
    <img width="300px" src="img/evil-conspiracy.png"> 
</p>

The only way for humanity to defeat the Devil is to stop falling for its tricks. Any time you feel malice, hatred, contempt, or even self-righteousness toward another being; any time you see them as fundamentally defective or inferior; you are being manipulated. As you begin to clear up this misperception in your own mind, you discover more of what is causing it in others', which is the only way to do anything genuinely useful about it.

> _Be kind, for everyone you meet is fighting a great battle._ —Author unknown

This is called compassion (or kindness), and it doesn't mean being _nice_. It can outwardly be as fierce (or violent, or _apparently_ contemptuous) as the situation warrants. It need not take any particular form, and cannot be reduced to principles, except for one: it never falls into the above misperception.

It doesn't always know what the most beneficial behavior _is_. That requires _wisdom_. Developing wisdom is a vast topic, and beyond the scope of this work. Compassion merely ensures that you are, indeed, behaving in a way that is aligned with your deepest values; your profound love for the world. People can subconsciously sense your motivation even when you think they can't — in fact, even when _you_ (consciously) can't — and it makes more difference than you can possibly know.

Compassion naturally stems from recognition of the vast interconnectedness of reality; perception of our fundamental unity. Seeing this in its entirety is _enlightenment._ But long before enlightenment, [we are all able to taste it](unity.md) to one degree or another.

Enlightenment is a lofty goal, but we can start small, by changing social norms. We can teach our children that contempt for "bad people" isn't what it seems to be, and refuse to support our allies when they engage in it. Contempt must go the way of all other forms of evil if we are to defeat our true enemy.

We each have our own ideas about "what's wrong with the world," and who is responsible. When we think about them, we tend to feel contempt. This seems like a healthy way to affirm our values, convey our disapproval, and deter others from similar misbehavior — in other words, to help us "fight evil" and save the world.

But what if it is a trap? What if this behavior is somehow creating the very conditions that enable the atrocities that we decry?

> _And no wonder, for even Satan masquerades as an angel of light._ —2 Corinthians 11:14

You know the classic image of the angel and devil sitting on our shoulders? It's _almost_ accurate, except for two things. First, the angel isn't really external to you, but represents the deepest aspect of your mind; your profound love for the world. In a deep sense, it *is* you. The devil is external; a kind of parasite[^intrinsic]. But it doesn't just whisper obviously-bad ideas in your ear; it pretends to be your inner angel, and alters your very perception so that evil appears righteous.

<p align="center" width="100%">

</p>

> _Be kind, for everyone you meet is fighting a great battle._ —Author unknown

Part of us *knows* when we are under the sway of our devil, but that knowledge is cleverly shielded from conscious self-reflection. This self-deception is enabled by some kind of "battle" that you may not even be conscious of. Your angel knows that this is how _all_ evil ultimately works, and so you're not fundamentally different from the "bad people." But your devil has a trick: it makes you perceive their evil as _intrinsic_, so that they appear fundamentally defective, and therefore worthy of harm.

In this shadowy state, you cannot help but darken the world — often in ways that you will never (consciously) recognize your own complicity in.

> _Ultimately evil is done not so much by evil people, but by good people who do not know themselves and who do not probe deeply._ —Roland Niebuhr

Even if you don't know _how_ to darken it, your malicious intent is being telegraphed in a thousand tiny ways, which other people will (maybe only subconsciously) pick up on as "evil." This signals to _their_ devils that it's safe to come out and join the party. If you are around your enemies, you will trigger each other into a downward spiral. If you are with your "allies," you will work each other into a violent froth. Either way, more evil is being created, and it will feel unmistakably _righteous_.

<p align="center" width="100%">
    <img width="300px" src="img/half-evil.png"> 
</p>

It is as though our devils are secretly coordinating to induce this shadowy state in the world. That is their *goal*: to pave the way for more evil. In fact, they behave more like outgrowths of a single shared "shadowy presence" that continually manipulates all of our minds; the _Devil_, if you will.

This is not just a religious invention: I think that everyone who introspects carefully enough eventually perceives this "distributed malevolent entity" which has a kind of intelligence and volition of its own that, even if not _literally_ true, explain its seemingly-coordinated behavior terrifyingly well. 

<p align="center" width="100%">
    <img width="300px" src="img/shared-devil.png"> 
</p>

It is the primordial "evil global conspiracy," to which all the rest ultimately owe their existence — and _we_ are its unwitting minions. Every attempt to maliciously subdue it "out there" just strengthens it, because such behavior is only ever initiated _by_ it, even though it makes us believe that it was initiated by us. **Any** time you feel malice, hatred, contempt, or even self-righteousness toward another being; any time you see them as fundamentally defective or inferior; you are being manipulated into feeding the Beast.

To be clear: there may well be groups of particularly "bad" people who conspire to cause great harm, but their existence wouldn't be possible if the rest of us weren't feeding the source — and conversely, it is _inevitable_ given that we are. **We must hold such people accountable**, but when we do this with contempt, we are reinforcing the conditions that effectively _compel_ their existence.

<p align="center" width="100%">
    <img width="300px" src="img/evil-conspiracy.png"> 
</p>

If we (the "good people") don't realize how easily we're being seduced by our evil, how in Hell do we expect the "bad people" to? The truth is, we _don't_ — because if they did, then we wouldn't be able to maintain our vaunted position as the "good people." This need to be special is precisely what allows our devils to so easily take control of our minds. It is what the Buddhists call the _ego._

Our true enemy is not other people, but the dark "entity" that has captured _all_ of our minds. By keeping our attention fixated perpetually outward, it ensures that we never introspect deeply enough to discover how it works, and thereby discover how to end it.

The more thoroughly you uncover this trick in yourself, the more clearly you perceive how nearly the whole world has fallen for it, and the less able you are to hate them for it. The less hatred you harbor, the more easily your "angel" can perceive the hidden causes of their self-deception, and the more it can do about it. This is called compassion. It is the only way to weaken the "Devil."

It doesn't mean being _nice_. Compassion can outwardly be as fierce (or violent[^dalai-lama-gun], or even _apparently_ contemptuous) as the situation warrants, but these behaviors come from a completely different source. People can subconsciously sense your motivation even when you think they can't — in fact, even when _you_ (consciously) can't — and it makes all the difference in the world.

Compassion is the natural byproduct of realizing of the vast interconnectedness of reality; perception of our fundamental unity. Seeing this in its entirety is _enlightenment._ But long before enlightenment, [we are all able to sense it](unity.md) to one degree or another.

Determining the most effective behavior requires _wisdom_, which is a vast topic, and beyond the scope of this work. There is no doubt that dealing with profound evil in the real world is _hard._

## Footnotes

[^contempt]: Specifically, we mean (genuine) contempt for *people*. Contempt for ideas or behaviors can actually be healthy, as perhaps can (apparent) contempt that is rooted in genuine compassion.

[^intrinsic]: You may wonder how it is possible to know that evil is not intrinsic to other people's minds, but for our purposes it's more important to see that (1) our _perception_ of their intrinsic defectiveness is our own projection, and (2) our own darkness gives us the capacity to devolve into a condition in which others would be utterly convinced that _ours_ is intrinsic.

MESSAGE: Rewrite homepage to be darker (wise people...)
================================


_[Warning: This piece deals with issues around the nature of evil. It is **not** light reading.]_

When wise people urge compassion for evildoers, they're not suggesting that we be _nice_. They're warning us about an insidious trap that the whole world is presently caught in.

Consider [this horrifying story from 2012](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/southamerica/brazil/9005835/Loggers-burned-Amazon-tribe-girl-alive.html):

> _Loggers in Brazil captured an eight-year-old girl from one of the Amazon's last uncontacted tribes and burned her alive as part of a campaign to force the indigenous population from its land [...]_

Reading this would make any sane person profoundly angry and heartbroken for the girl, her tribe, and humanity. It makes us want to do everything in our power to ensure this kind of thing never happens again — which may require punishing or even harming the perpetrators. At the same time, we may feel a desire to harm them quite independently of any good it will bring: pure old-fashioned vengeance.

These two motivations — compassion and malice — arise from very different aspects of mind. But they can be extremely difficult to tell apart — particularly because we often dress up the latter to make it seem respectable; as though it is "for the greater good." We tell ourselves that it doesn't matter which intention is driving our behavior, because only the _result_ is important.

_This confusion is how evil sneaks into the world, undetected._

<p align="center" width="100%">
    <img width="300px" src="img/half-evil.png"> 
</p>

People are _exquisitely_ sensitive to our motivations, and malice makes us look evil — because it _is_ (as we shall see). We may not even be aware of how it comes across, but others are (if only subconsciously), and it powerfully evokes _their_ malice. Our allies join in the frenzy, while our enemies feel compelled to fight _our_ evil in return. Even if it scares them into changing their behavior (in public, anyway), the darkness has been embedded deeper into their minds, and _will_ manifest in some way — though perhaps far enough away in time and space that we can disown all complicity.

The world becomes darker as a result. This isn't an unfortunate side effect of our well-intentioned behavior: the whole thing was secretly orchestrated by a sinister aspect within our minds. The way this works is _insanely_ clever.

<p align="center" width="100%">
    <img width="300px" src="img/evil-above-world.png"> 
</p>

People are only able to misbehave due to a kind of self-deception: part of them knows perfectly well that what they're doing is wrong, but that "wrongness" is cleverly hidden from conscious self-reflection. Part of us knows this, and that our malice will only deepen their self-deception, thus enabling more evil. But we hide this knowledge from ourselves and forge ahead anyway, telling ourselves that our behavior is righteous. _This is self-deception_ — and it makes them perceive us as evil for precisely the same reason that we did them, leading to a downward spiral into Hell.

It's not the _harm itself_ that triggered this spiral, but the malice with which we did it. Harming them out of fierce compassion may still provoke some form of retaliation, but the profoundly benevolent intent prevents their self-deception mechanism from finding the "hook" it needs to reinforce itself.

<p align="center" width="100%">
    <img width="300px" src="img/devil-vs-devil.png"> 
</p>

If it is really this simple, then why aren't we already doing it?

Part of us _knows_ that we're not intrinsically better than anyone, but we hide this from ourselves. We use malice to keep the "bad people" trapped in delusion, so that we can prove ourselves morally superior. Unfortunately, baiting people into evil is hardly "morally superior," and so we must hide this, too, in a tightening noose of deception. It collapses in on itself like a black hole, preventing us from ever suspecting our dark motives.

Let's look at this from another angle.

Your self-image prevents you from being cruel to just anyone, so your devil does something very clever: it searches for people whose "battle" is hard for you to see, and makes their devil appear _intrinsic_. This way, they appear _fundamentally morally defective,_ and thus worthy of malice.

Long before it can justify outright cruelty, our devil finds people who we can treat with at least a little bit of contempt. The game is the same: use it to prod people into becoming increasingly worse, until we _can_ justify cruelty.

We don't have enough power to accomplish much alone — but luckily, our devils are coordinating: mine baits yours into baiting mine ... Enemies trigger each other, and "allies" embolden each other, but secretly _everyone_ doing this is allied in evil. In fact, if you look closely, our devils behave more like outgrowths of a single _shared_ Devil that is continually manipulating _all_ of our minds.

It is not just a religious invention: I think that everyone who introspects carefully enough eventually perceives this "distributed malevolent entity" which has a kind of intelligence and volition of its own that, even if not _literally_ true, explain its seemingly-coordinated behavior terrifyingly well.

It continually drives us toward various kinds of Armageddon: situations in which everyone is violently proving just how righteous they are. This is why the US is headed toward civil war without anyone recognizing their own complicity, and it explains bitter divorces in which each side feels like the exclusive victim / hero.

<p align="center" width="100%">

**Any** time you feel malice, hatred, contempt, or even self-righteousness toward another being; any time you see them as fundamentally defective or inferior; any time you are tempted to divide the world into the (fundamentally) "good" and "bad," you are being manipulated into feeding the Beast. People are certainly trapped by darkness to varying degrees, but it is never intrinsic.

<p align="center" width="100%">
    <img width="300px" src="img/good-vs-bad.png">

To be clear: there may well be groups of particularly "bad" people who conspire to cause great harm, but their existence wouldn't be possible if the rest of us weren't feeding the source — and conversely, it is _inevitable_ given that we are. **We must hold such people accountable**, but when we do this with contempt, we are reinforcing the conditions that effectively _compel_ their existence.

The only way out of this trap is to see beyond the ego, to your fundamentally compassionate nature. When you see this, you cannot help but see it in everyone else, too — because in an astonishing sense, [they _are_ you](unity.md). From here, you cannot possibly harbor malice or contempt. This frees you up to perceive the hidden causes of their self-deception, enabling you to do something real about it. This is not fully developed until enlightenment, but we all can taste it at all times.

Why "willful"? The remarkable punchline is that _part of you has known this all along._ Think of this piece as a reminder.

From that clarity of perception, you cannot possibly harbor malice or contempt. That enables you to perceive the hidden causes of their self-deception, allowing you to do something real about it. That's what compassion (aka kindness) is.

People can sense your motivation even when you think they can't — in fact, even when _you_ (consciously) can't — and it makes all the difference in the world.

_This_ is why wise people urge compassion for evildoers: the _only_ alternative is to join them in evil.

Compassion doesn't always know what the most beneficial behavior _is_. It merely ensures that you are behaving in a way that is aligned with your deepest values; your profound love for the world. Determining the most effective behavior requires _wisdom_, which is a vast topic, and beyond the scope of this work. There is no doubt that dealing with profound evil in the real world is _hard_, and I am sorry not to be able to provide much guidance here.

Enlightenment may be a lofty goal, but we can start small, by changing social norms. We can teach our children the difference between "kind" and "nice," and explain why kindness is _always_ the right motivation in all circumstances — even if it must express itself in a fierce (and occasionally violent) way. We can refuse to join our allies when they're caught up in the trap of contempt[^contempt], and remind them of a better way.

We _all_ have a role to play in defeating our true enemy — and it all begins with us.

_Warning: This piece is about the nature of good and evil. It is **not** light reading._

When wise people urge compassion for evildoers, they're not suggesting that we be _nice_. They're warning us about an insidious trap that we keep falling into, and that is destroying our civilization.

Consider [this horrifying story from 2012](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/southamerica/brazil/9005835/Loggers-burned-Amazon-tribe-girl-alive.html):

> _Loggers in Brazil captured an eight-year-old girl from one of the Amazon's last uncontacted tribes and burned her alive as part of a campaign to force the indigenous population from its land [...]_

Can you feel the profound anger and heartbreak for the girl, her tribe, and humanity? It makes you want to do everything in your power to ensure this kind of thing never happens again — including punishing and maybe even harming the perpetrators if need be. At the same time, you may feel a desire to harm them quite _independently_ of any good it will bring: pure old-fashioned vengeance.

These two motivations — compassion and malice — arise from very different aspects of mind, but can be _extremely_ difficult to tell apart. We usually dress up the latter to make it seem respectable; like it is "for the greater good." We tell ourselves that it doesn't matter which intention is driving our behavior; that only the _result_ matters. Similarly, we feel more than okay being casually cruel to anyone we perceive as vaguely "bad," because we are good — and therefore such behavior _must_ be good. We even calculate _how_ it will be good (for example, by shutting them up).

This profound confusion is how evil sneaks into the world undetected.

_Before I speak to your mind, let me speak to your heart. Imagine how dark and twisted a mind has to become to feel okay about doing what those loggers did. If you inspect your heart carefully enough, you will find that pushing such a mind deeper into the abyss is every bit as malevolent as burning a girl alive. But we carefully hide this truth from ourselves, to avoid confronting something that we'd be much better off dealing with immediately. This isn't a judgement of you. It's an attempt at communicating a horrifying punchline that part of us already knows is coming sooner or later._

We can't calculate all the downstream effects of even our tiniest behavior, but we _can_ know when we are being evil — and we owe it to ourselves and the world to stop.

<p align="center" width="100%">
    <img width="300px" src="img/half-evil.png"> 
</p>

As much as we try to hide our underlying motivations — even from ourselves — other people are _exquisitely_ sensitive to them, if only subconsciously. Malice makes us look evil — _because it is_, as we shall see — and it powerfully evokes _their_ malice in response.

Whatever storyline was justifying our target's behavior in the first place, it is now reinforced — because they can plausibly claim to be _fighting evil_. Our allies become more bloodlusted, too. Even if our target changes their behavior (in public, anyway), the darkness has been embedded deeper into their mind, and this _will_ manifest in some way and ripple out into the world — and we will be able to disown all complicity.

The world becomes darker as a result. But this isn't an unfortunate side effect of our well-intentioned behavior: it was secretly orchestrated by a sinister aspect within our minds. The way this works is _insanely_ clever.

<p align="center" width="100%">
    <img width="300px" src="img/evil-above-world.png"> 
</p>

People are only able to misbehave due to a kind of self-deception: part of them knows perfectly well that what they're doing is wrong, but that "wrongness" is cleverly hidden from conscious self-reflection. Part of us knows this, and that our malice will only exacerbate the problem, but we hide this knowledge from ourselves — because our identity as "good people" depends on them not "seeing the light," and who could blame us for not helping them see it? _This is self-deception_ — which makes them perceive us as evil for precisely the same reason that we did them, triggering a downward spiral into Hell.

It's not the _harm itself_ that caused this spiral, but the malice with which we did it. Harming them out of fierce compassion may still provoke some form of retaliation, but the profoundly benevolent intent prevents their self-deception mechanism from finding the "hook" it needs to reinforce itself.

<p align="center" width="100%">
    <img width="300px" src="img/devil-vs-devil.png"> 
</p>

If it is really this simple, then why aren't we already doing it?

Part of us _knows_ that we're not intrinsically better than anyone — but given how low people can sink, this is painful to admit, so we hide it. We use malice to keep people trapped in delusion, so that we can stay safely morally superior. Unfortunately, pushing people into the dark is hardly "morally superior," so we must hide this, too, in an ever-tightening noose of deception that collapses in on itself like a black hole, preventing us from ever suspecting what we're really doing.

Of course, we can't push just _anyone_ into the dark. We need plausible deniability...

> _And no wonder, for even Satan masquerades as an angel of light._ —2 Corinthians 11:14

You know the classic image of the angel and devil sitting on our shoulders? It's _almost_ accurate, except for two things. First, the angel isn't really external to you, but represents your true nature as compassion. In a deep sense, it *is* you (as we will discover later). The devil is external; a kind of parasite[^intrinsic]. But it doesn't just whisper obviously-bad ideas in your ear; it alters your very perception and pretends to be your inner angel.

<p align="center" width="100%">
    <img width="300px" src="img/parasite.png"> 
</p>

> _Be kind, for everyone you meet is fighting a great battle._ —Author unknown

Your angel knows that this is how things work, and that even the most "evil" person is really under the sway of a parasite; one held in place by some "battle" invisible not only to you, but probably also them. As hard as it may be to evict, it's never _impossible._ Your devil makes it _appear_ impossible; as though their evil is intrinsic. They are _fundamentally defective_. This way, you don't need to worry about whether your behavior "drives it deeper," for there is no such thing.

But it gets crazier: your devil also knows that your perceiving them this way will cause them to perceive you in the same way — because your devil and theirs are identical. In fact, they're not just identical, but behave more like outgrowths of a single _shared_ Devil that is continually manipulating _all_ of our minds.

<p align="center" width="100%">
    <img width="300px" src="img/shared-devil.png"> 
</p>

This is not just a religious invention: anyone who introspects carefully enough eventually perceives this "distributed malevolent entity" with a kind of intelligence and volition of its own that, even if not _literally_ true, explain its seemingly-coordinated behavior terrifyingly well. 

It continually drives us toward various kinds of Armageddon: situations in which everyone is violently proving how righteous they are, once and for all. It is why the US is headed toward civil war without anyone recognizing their own complicity, and why there are bitter [divorces](https://www.gottman.com/blog/this-one-thing-is-the-biggest-predictor-of-divorce/) in which each side feels like the exclusive victim / hero. Nearly the whole world is caught in its terrible sway, evil provoking "righteous" evil at nearly every turn; everyone pointing fingers at everyone else, studiously overlooking its true source.

It is that primordial "evil global conspiracy" to which all the rest ultimately owe their existence — and _we_ are its unwitting minions. Every attempt to maliciously subdue it "out there" just strengthens it, because such behavior is only ever initiated _by_ it, while making us believe that it was initiated by us. 

**Any** time you feel malice, hatred, contempt, or even self-righteousness toward another being; any time you see them as fundamentally defective or inferior; any time you are tempted to divide the world into the (fundamentally) "good" and "bad," or to forsake anyone, you are being manipulated into feeding the Beast.

<p align="center" width="100%">
    <img width="300px" src="img/good-vs-bad.png"> 
</p>

To be clear: there are surely groups of particularly deluded people who conspire to cause great harm, but their existence wouldn't be possible if the rest of us weren't feeding the source — and conversely, it is _inevitable_ given that we are. **We must hold such people accountable**, but when we do this with contempt, we are reinforcing the conditions that effectively _compel_ their existence. If you look carefully enough, you will find your finger in their pies.

<p align="center" width="100%">
    <img width="300px" src="img/evil-conspiracy.png"> 
</p>

Our true enemy is not other people, but the dark "entity" that has captured _all_ of our minds. By keeping our attention fixated perpetually outward, it ensures that we never introspect deeply enough to discover how it works, and how to end it. From another perspective, it is what the Buddhists call the ego: the collection of habits we have developed that cause us to misperceive ourselves as separate and special.

> *The shadow is a moral problem that challenges the whole ego-personality, for no one can become conscious of the shadow without considerable moral effort. To become conscious of it involves recognizing the dark aspects of the personality as present and real. This act is the essential condition for any kind of self-knowledge.* —Carl Jung

The only way out of this trap is to see beyond the ego, to your fundamentally compassionate nature. When you see this, you cannot help but see it in everyone else, too — because in an astonishing sense, [they _are_ you](unity.md). This perception is not fully unveiled until enlightenment, but we can all taste it. Ultimately, all self-deception boils down to willful ignorance of this fact — and all unkindness reinforces it. Why "willful"? The remarkable punchline is that _part of you has known this all along._ Think of this piece as a reminder.

From that clarity of perception, you cannot possibly harbor malice or contempt. That enables you to perceive the hidden causes of their self-deception, allowing you to do something real about it. That's what compassion (aka kindness) is.

To be clear: this doesn't mean being _nice_. It can outwardly be as fierce (or violent[^dalai-lama-gun], or even _apparently_ contemptuous) as the situation warrants, but these behaviors come from a completely different source. People can sense your motivation even when you think they can't — in fact, even when _you_ (consciously) can't — and it makes all the difference in the world.

_Warning: This piece is about the nature of good and evil. It is **not** light reading._

---

Sometimes it is only after the fact that we discover that we _always_ knew that something was wrong, even when we thought that it wasn't. Thus it can happen that we come to deeply regret behaviors that felt completely okay at the time, realizing (to our horror) that part of us knew better even as we engaged in them.

So it is with _all_ acts of unkindness, in the final analysis.

Something within you knows that kindness is always the right approach in every situation — including the ones where it seems "obviously" wrong. There's a part of you that wants to respond to the evils of the world by hardening your heart and becoming a tiny bit evil yourself. Of course, you probably don't think of it as "being evil." We tend to call it righteous retribution. But something deep within you knows that what's really happening is that the evil out there is taking root in here.

Every single time you feel malice, hatred, contempt, or _even self-righteousness_ toward anyone — no matter how "evil" — you are preparing to do something that you know will ultimately harm the world. The difficulty is in getting yourself to admit this.

The faster we all get our act together, the better. The fate of humanity depends on it.

Because you eventually discover that _part of you has known this all along._ This piece is merely a reminder.

From that clarity of perception, you cannot possibly harbor malice or contempt. That enables you to perceive the hidden causes of people's self-deception, allowing you to do something real about it. That's what compassion (aka kindness) is.

To repeat: it doesn't mean being _nice_. It can outwardly be as fierce (or violent[^dalai-lama-gun], or even _apparently_ contemptuous) as the situation warrants, but these behaviors come from a completely different source. People can sense your motivation even when you think they can't — in fact, sometimes even when _you_ (consciously) can't — and it makes all the difference in the world.

_This_ is why wise people urge compassion for evildoers: the only alternative is to be evil.

Compassion doesn't always know what the most beneficial behavior _is_; it merely ensures that you are not falling into the many seductive traps of your darkness. Determining the most effective behavior requires _wisdom_, which is a vast topic, and beyond the scope of this work. Compassion may be no easier to acquire, but it is much simpler: there is a single place within your mind that you can turn to and _know._ So much trouble could be avoided if we just looked — especially when we least felt the need to.

Enlightenment may be a lofty goal to expect of humanity, but we can start small, by changing social norms. We can teach our children the difference between "kind" and "nice," and explain the sense in which kindness is _always_ the right motivation in all circumstances. We can refuse to join our allies when they're caught up in the traps of contempt[^contempt] and malice, and serve as an example of a better way.

## Footnotes

[^contempt]: Specifically, we mean (genuine) contempt for *people*. Contempt for ideas or behaviors can actually be healthy, as perhaps can (apparent) contempt that is rooted in genuine compassion.

[^intrinsic]: You may wonder how it is possible to know that evil is not intrinsic to other people's minds, but for our purposes it's more important to see that (1) our _perception_ of their intrinsic defectiveness is our own projection, and (2) our own darkness gives us the capacity to devolve into a condition in which others would be utterly convinced that _ours_ is intrinsic.

================================


_Warning: This piece is about the nature of good and evil. It is **not** light reading._

---

What if your fight to improve the world is doing more harm than good? And what if there's a part of you that already knows this but doesn't want you to find out?

Consider [this horrifying story from 2012](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/southamerica/brazil/9005835/Loggers-burned-Amazon-tribe-girl-alive.html):

> _Loggers in Brazil captured an eight-year-old girl from one of the Amazon's last uncontacted tribes and burned her alive as part of a campaign to force the indigenous population from its land [...]_

Can you feel the profound anger and heartbreak for the girl, her tribe, and humanity? It makes you want to do everything in your power to ensure this kind of thing never happens again — including punishing and maybe even harming the perpetrators if need be. At the same time, you may feel a desire to harm them quite _independently_ of any good it will bring: pure old-fashioned vengeance.

These two motivations — compassion and malice — arise from very different aspects of mind, but can be extremely difficult to tell apart. We usually dress up the latter to make it seem respectable; as though it is "for the greater good." We convince ourselves that it doesn't matter which intention is driving our behavior; that only the _result_ matters. Because we are "good people," pretty much anything we do is automatically good. If pressed, we can even _prove_ how our cruelty will be a net good.

This profound confusion is how evil sneaks into the world, undetected.

_Before I speak to your mind, let me speak to your heart. Imagine how dark and twisted a mind has to become to feel okay about doing what that logger did. If you introspect carefully enough, you will discover that part of you is eager to shove it deeper into Hell — and that this violent urge is every bit as malevolent as burning a girl alive. The evil in their mind has spread to yours and made you feel more than okay about it. Until you see how effortlessly it has seduced you, you will never understand the trick by which it has enslaved our world. You will only succeed in unwittingly spreading it. The world needs your fierce, uncompromising Love, not your contempt. They are **not** the same._

We can't predict all the downstream effects of even our tiniest behaviors to know if they wil be a "net good," but we _can_ know when we are being evil — and it happens far more often than we realize.

<p align="center" width="100%">
    <img width="300px" src="img/half-evil.png"> 
</p>

As much as we try to hide our underlying motivations — even from ourselves — other people are _exquisitely_ sensitive to them, if only subconsciously. Malice makes us look evil — _because it is_ — and it powerfully evokes _their_ malice in response.

They now feel every bit as justified in violently stopping us as we do them, because they can now plausibly claim to be _fighting evil_. Even if we manage to suppress their misbehavior (in public, anyway), the darkness has been embedded deeper into their mind — and it _will_ manifest in some way. From there, it will ripple out into the world, where we will be able to disavow any connection to it.

The world becomes darker as a result. But this isn't an unfortunate side effect of our well-intentioned behavior: it was secretly orchestrated by a sinister aspect within our minds. The way this works is _insanely_ clever.

<p align="center" width="100%">
    <img width="300px" src="img/evil-above-world.png"> 
</p>

People are only able to misbehave due to a kind of self-deception: part of them knows perfectly well that what they're doing is wrong, but that "wrongness" is cleverly hidden from conscious self-reflection. Part of us knows this, and that our malice will only exacerbate the problem, but we hide this knowledge from ourselves. If we could see that we were doing this, we would understand _exactly_ the mechanism that enables their misbehavior, and thereby be able to do something useful about it. Instead, we fall into the same trap that they're caught in, triggering a mutual spiral into Hell.

It's not merely _harming_ them that caused this spiral, but the malice with which we did it. It is entirely possible to harm people out of fierce compassion for the world, but it feels **nothing** like malice. Others can sense the profoundly benevolent intent, and it prevents their self-deception mechanism from finding the "hook" it needs to reinforce itself. In fact, it may well plant the seed of introspection, which will _weaken_ the source of evil. Your powerful example of resisting the siren call of darkness and standing firm in your integrity matters far more than you know.

<p align="center" width="100%">
    <img width="300px" src="img/devil-vs-devil.png"> 
</p>

If it is really this simple, then why haven't we (as a species) figured it out and changed our ways?

Part of us _knows_ that we're not intrinsically better than anyone — but given how low people can sink, this is painful to admit, so we hide it. We use malice to keep people trapped in delusion, so that we can prove that we are morally superior. Unfortunately, pushing people into the dark is hardly "morally superior," so we must hide this intention from ourselves, too, convincing ourselves that we are only "fighting evil." This results in an ever-tightening noose of deception that collapses in on itself like a black hole, preventing us from ever suspecting what we're really doing.

Somewhere down this dark path, we will lose even the _pretense_ of being good. That's where the "evil people" find themselves trapped. The only way to protect against this slippery slope is to recognize how it works, and how susceptible you are to it.

> _And no wonder, for even Satan masquerades as an angel of light._ —2 Corinthians 11:14

You know the classic image of the angel and devil sitting on our shoulders? It's _almost_ accurate, except for two things. First, the angel isn't really external to you, but represents your true nature as compassion. In a deep sense, it *is* you. The devil is external; a kind of parasite[^intrinsic]. But it doesn't just whisper obviously-bad ideas in your ear; it alters your very perception and pretends to be your inner angel.

<p align="center" width="100%">
    <img width="300px" src="img/parasite.png"> 
</p>

> _Be kind, for everyone you meet is fighting a great battle._ —Author unknown

Your angel already knows all this, and that even the most "evil" person is merely under the sway of a powerful parasite; one held in place by some "battle" invisible not only to you, but probably even to them. As hard as it may be to evict it, it's never _impossible._ But your devil makes it _appear_ impossible; as though their evil is intrinsic. This way, they seem _fundamentally defective_, and therefore worthy of malice. Thus begins the dehumanization.

Your devil knows that this hardening of your heart will appear evil to others — because it is the very _essence_ of evil — and so it knows that it will trigger the same reflex in them. It knows this because your devil and theirs are identical. In fact, they're more than just identical: they behave more like outgrowths of a single collective entity that is continually manipulating _all_ of our minds — the Devil, if you will.

<p align="center" width="100%">
    <img width="300px" src="img/shared-devil.png"> 
</p>

This is not just a religious invention: anyone who introspects carefully enough eventually perceives this "distributed malevolent entity" with a kind of intelligence and volition of its own that, even if not _literally_ true, explain its seemingly-coordinated behavior terrifyingly well. 

This "being" continually drives humanity toward various kinds of Armageddon: situations in which everyone is violently proving just how righteous they are. It is why the US is headed toward civil war without anyone recognizing their own complicity, and explains bitter [divorces](https://www.gottman.com/blog/this-one-thing-is-the-biggest-predictor-of-divorce/) in which each side feels like the exclusive victim / hero. Nearly the whole world is caught in its terrible sway, evil provoking "righteous" retribution at every turn without anyone ever noticing who is really in charge.

It is that primordial "evil global conspiracy" to which all the rest ultimately owe their existence — and _we_ are its unwitting minions. Every attempt to maliciously subdue it "out there" just strengthens it, because such behavior is only ever initiated _by_ it — though it makes us believe that it was initiated by us, in the service of Good.

**Any** time you feel malice, hatred, contempt, or self-righteousness toward another being; any time you see them as fundamentally defective or inferior; any time you are tempted to divide the world into the (fundamentally) "good" and "bad," or to forsake anyone, you are feeding the insatiable Beast.

<p align="center" width="100%">
    <img width="300px" src="img/good-vs-bad.png"> 
</p>

To be clear: there are surely groups of particularly deluded people who conspire to cause great harm, but their existence wouldn't be possible if the rest of us weren't busy feeding the source — and conversely, it is _completely inevitable_ given that we are. **We must hold such people accountable**, but when we do this with contempt, we are reinforcing the very conditions that _compel_ their existence. If you could trace all the subtle threads of causality weaving through the wrold, you would find your finger in countless evil pies.

<p align="center" width="100%">
    <img width="300px" src="img/evil-conspiracy.png"> 
</p>

Our true enemy is not other people, but the dark "entity" that has captured _all_ of our minds. By keeping our attention fixated perpetually outward, it ensures that we never introspect deeply enough to notice our own role. This distraction is roughly what the Buddhists call the ego: the collection of habits we have developed to overlook our intimate interconnection with all of reality, so that we may elevate ourselves at its expense. It [pretends to _be_ you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gg8JYYyWSPg), but it is not your friend.

> *The shadow is a moral problem that challenges the whole ego-personality, for no one can become conscious of the shadow without considerable moral effort. To become conscious of it involves recognizing the dark aspects of the personality as present and real. This act is the essential condition for any kind of self-knowledge.* —Carl Jung

The only way out of this trap is to see beyond the ego, to your fundamentally compassionate nature. When you see this, you cannot help but see it in everyone else, too — because in an astonishing and heart-wrenching sense, [everyone **is** you](unity.md). This perception is not fully unveiled until enlightenment, but we can all taste it at all times. Ultimately, all self-deception boils down to willful ignorance of this fact — and all unkindness reinforces it. Why do I say "willful" ignorance? Because you eventually discover that _part of you has known this all along._ Think of this piece as a reminder.

From that clarity of perception, you cannot possibly harbor malice or contempt. You see it for the pure nonsense that it is. This enables you to perceive the hidden causes of people's self-deception, allowing you to do something real about it. That's what compassion (aka kindness) is.

To repeat: it doesn't mean being _nice_. It can outwardly be as fierce (or violent[^dalai-lama-gun], or even _apparently_ contemptuous) as the situation warrants, but these behaviors come from a completely different source, and have a completely different effect on all minds involved — again, rippling outward into the world, in ways that we can't see or predict.

_This_ is why wise people urge compassion for evildoers: the only alternative is to join them in evil, usually while flawlessly convinced that you're helping.

To be clear, compassion doesn't always know what the most beneficial behavior _is_; it merely ensures that you are not falling into the many seductive traps of your darkness. Determining the most effective behavior requires _wisdom_, which is a vast topic, and beyond the scope of this work. Compassion may be no easier to acquire than wisdom, but it is much simpler: there is a single place within your mind that you can turn to and _know._ So much trouble could be avoided if we just remembered to **look** — especially when we were most convinced that we didn't need to.

How do we not lose our hearts in the face of evil? And why _should_ we not?

Ultimately, no answer is as satisfying as discovering for yourself the astonishing ruse by which evil has captured our hearts.

</p>

People are only able to misbehave due to a kind of self-deception: part of them knows perfectly well that what they're doing is wrong, but that "wrongness" is cleverly hidden from conscious self-reflection. We all know this state perfectly well, if we're honest. Every one of us has skirted our conscience, either pretending that we couldn't hear it, or that it was safe to override it. Try to remember what that state is like.

In this state, wrong no longer feels _wrong_ — and it would take considerable skill for someone to call out our misbehavior without triggering our defense mechanisms and making a bigger mess. If they did it with a trace of cruelty, we would immediately identify them as someone without the moral authority to be judging us. We would see them as being blithely unaware of their own darkness, and in need of correction themselves. It would result in a mutual spiral into Hell.

Do they know that this will happen? Consciously, they do not. They imagine that their overwhelming _righteousness_ will cause us to repent. But at a deeper level, they know that this story is a sham. Part of them secretly wants to egg us on, so that their unflattering view of us will be vindicated — but they cannot admit this to themselves, any more than we can admit our own self-deception to ourselves in that moment.

The same is true when we use malice to correct "bad people." Part of us is trying to provoke them, but we convince ourselves that we're doing it for the greater good. If we could just see how this process of self-deception works in us, we would understand _exactly_ the mechanism that enables their misbehavior, which would enable to do something useful about it. Instead, we get sucked into the same old trap, triggering that downward spiral.

It's not merely _harming_ them that causes this spiral, but the malice with which we do it. It is entirely possible to harm people out of fierce compassion for the world, but it feels **nothing** like malice. The connection to your "heart" has not been severed. Others can sense the profoundly benevolent intent, and it prevents their evil from finding the "hook" it needs to justify itself. Instead, it is confronted with a blinding Light that will weaken it, if only imperceptibly. Indeed, it is the only thing that can.

Unfortunately, shoving people into Hell is hardly "morally superior," so we must hide this intention from ourselves, too, by convincing ourselves that it is noble. This results in an ever-tightening noose of deception that collapses in on itself like a black hole, preventing us from ever suspecting what we're really doing.

(This is why it feels so damn delicious to watch revenge fantasy flicks like _The Equalizer_, or those "Karens Getting Owned" YouTube videos. They are playing to this delusion, pure and simple — and as a culture, we eat it up.)

Every attempt to maliciously subdue it "out there" just strengthens it, because such behavior is only ever initiated _by_ it — though it makes us believe that it was initiated by us.

**Any** time you feel malice, hatred, contempt, or even self-righteousness toward another being; any time you see them as fundamentally defective or inferior; any time you are tempted to divide the world into the (fundamentally) "good" and "bad," or to forsake anyone, you are feeding the Beast.

<p align="center" width="100%">
    <img width="300px" src="img/good-vs-bad.png"> 
</p>

To be clear: there are surely groups of particularly deluded people who conspire to cause great harm, but their existence wouldn't be possible if the rest of us weren't busy feeding the source — and conversely, it is _completely inevitable_ given that we are. **We must hold such people accountable**, but when we do this with contempt, we are reinforcing the very conditions that _compel_ their existence. If you could trace all the subtle threads of causality weaving through the world, you would find your finger in countless evil pies.

Our true enemy is not other people, but the dark "entity" that has captured _all_ of our minds. By keeping our attention fixated perpetually outward, it ensures that we never introspect deeply enough to notice our own role. This distraction is roughly what the Buddhists call the ego: the collection of habits we have developed to overlook our intimate interconnection with all of reality, so that we may elevate ourselves at its expense. It [pretends to _be_ you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gg8JYYyWSPg), but it is not your friend.

To become conscious of it involves recognizing the dark aspects of the personality as present and real. This act is the essential condition for any kind of self-knowledge.* —Carl Jung

The only way out of this trap is to see beyond the ego, to your fundamentally compassionate nature. When you see this, you cannot help but see it in everyone else, too — because in an astonishing and heart-wrenching sense, [everyone **is** you](unity.md). This perception is not fully unveiled until enlightenment, but we can all taste it at all times. Ultimately, all self-deception boils down to willful ignorance of this fact — and all unkindness reinforces it. Why do I say "willful" ignorance? Because you eventually discover that _part of you has known this all along._ Think of this piece as a reminder.

From that clarity of perception, you cannot possibly harbor malice or contempt. You see it for the pure nonsense that it is. This enables you to perceive the hidden causes of people's self-deception, allowing you to do something real about it. That's what compassion (aka kindness) is.

To repeat: it doesn't mean being _nice_. It can outwardly be as fierce (or violent[^dalai-lama-gun], or even _apparently_ contemptuous) as the situation warrants, but these behaviors come from a completely different source, and have a completely different effect on all minds involved — again, rippling outward into the world in ways that we can't see or predict.

_This_ is why wise people urge compassion for evildoers: the only alternative is to join them in evil.

To be clear, compassion doesn't always know what the most beneficial behavior _is_; it merely ensures that you are not falling into the many seductive traps of your darkness. Determining the most effective behavior requires _wisdom_, which is a vast topic, and beyond the scope of this work. Compassion may be no easier to acquire than wisdom, but it is much simpler: there is a single place within your mind that you can turn to and _know._ So much trouble could be avoided if we just remembered to **look** — especially when we were most convinced that we didn't need to.

We think that hating "bad people" is a sign of the good in us, but what if it's a sign of something far more insidious? Evil doesn't announce itself as "evil" when it infiltrates our minds...

---

Consider [this horrifying story from 2012](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/southamerica/brazil/9005835/Loggers-burned-Amazon-tribe-girl-alive.html):

> _Loggers in Brazil captured an eight-year-old girl from one of the Amazon's last uncontacted tribes and burned her alive as part of a campaign to force the indigenous population from its land [...]_

<p align="center" width="100%">
    <img width="300px" src="img/tribe.png"> 
</p>

Can you feel the profound anger and heartbreak for the girl, her tribe, and humanity? It makes you want to do everything in your power to ensure this kind of thing never happens again — including punishing and maybe even harming the perpetrators if need be. At the same time, you may feel a desire to harm them quite _independently_ of any good it will bring: pure old-fashioned vengeance.

These two motivations — compassion and malice — arise from very different aspects of mind, but can be extremely difficult to tell apart. We usually dress up the latter to make it seem respectable; as though it is "for the greater good." We convince ourselves that it doesn't matter which intention is driving our behavior; that only the result matters — as though our intentions have no effect on the ultimate outcome.

This convenient story is how evil sneaks into the world, undetected.

_Before I speak to your mind, let me speak to your heart. Imagine how dark and twisted a mind must become to feel okay about doing what that logger did. If you introspect deeply enough, you will discover that part of you would delight in shoving it deeper into hell, where it "belongs" — and that this violent urge is every bit as malevolent as burning a girl alive. The evil in the logger's mind is spreading to yours — only it doesn't feel evil; it feels impossibly **righteous**. Until you see how this seduction works, you will never understand the trick by which evil has enslaved our world. You will only succeed in unwittingly spreading it. The world desperately needs our fierce, uncompromising Love; not our contempt. They are **not** the same. One is the evil twin of the other._

We can't predict all the downstream effects of even our tiniest behaviors, but we _can_ know whether we are being totally honest about our intentions — and surprisingly, others can, too. 

<p align="center" width="100%">
    <img width="300px" src="img/half-evil.png"> 
</p>

Other people are _exquisitely_ sensitive to our motivations, even if only subconsciously. They can detect our malicious intent, even when we (consciously) can't. It makes us look evil — because it _is_ — and this powerfully evokes _their_ malice in response.

They then feel justified in violently stopping us, because from their perspective they are legitimately _fighting evil_. Even if our cruelty manages to suppress their misbehavior (in public, anyway), the darkness has been embedded deeper into their mind — and it _will_ manifest in some way. From there, it will ripple out into the world, where we will be able to disavow any connection to it.

The world becomes darker as a result. But this isn't an unfortunate side effect of our well-intentioned behavior: it was secretly orchestrated by a sinister aspect within our minds. The way this works is _insanely_ clever.

<p align="center" width="100%">
    <img width="300px" src="img/evil-above-world.png"> 
</p>

People are only able to misbehave due to a kind of self-deception: part of them knows perfectly well when what they're doing is wrong, but that "wrongness" is cleverly hidden from conscious self-reflection. We believe that we can force them to acknowledge it, but this usually backfires: it makes them perceive _us_ as bad people, triggering a nasty response, which then forces us to escalate.

Part of us secretly knew this would happen. In fact, it _planned_ it. We wanted them to react poorly, so that we could prove to ourselves just how bad they are, thus licensing righteous escalation. Part of us knows perfectly well that we are doing this, but another part is carefully hiding that fact from ourselves. Sound familiar? We are caught in precisely the same self-deceptive trap that they are.

If we could just see how easily we deceive ourselves, we would understand the mechanism that enables _all_ misbehavior, which would empower to do something useful about it. Instead, we get sucked into the same trap that humanity has been for millennia.

It's not _harming_ them that is the problem, but the malice with which we do it. It is entirely possible to harm people out of fierce compassion for the world, but it feels **nothing** like malice. The crucial connection to our "heart" has not been severed. Others can sense the profoundly benevolent intent, and it prevents their evil from finding the "hook" it needs to reinforce itself. Instead, it is confronted with a blinding Light that will weaken it, if only imperceptibly — the _true_ "righteousness" that we falsely thought we were accessing through malice.

<p align="center" width="100%">
    <img width="300px" src="img/devil-vs-devil.png"> 
</p>

If it is really this simple, then why haven't we (as a species) figured it out and changed our ways?

Part of us _knows_ that we're not intrinsically better than anyone — but given how low people can sink, this is painful to admit, so we hide it from ourselves. We use malice to keep people trapped in delusion, so that we can prove our morally superiority. Unfortunately, shoving people into Hell is hardly "morally superior," so we must hide this intention from ourselves, too, by dressing it up as noble. This results in an ever-tightening noose of deception that collapses in on itself like a black hole, preventing us from ever suspecting what we're really doing.

In other words, we _need_ to see people as fundamentally bad, to remind ourselves that we are nothing like them. So we subconsciously behave in ways that "help" them stay bad. How? Not only by pushing them down, but by also trying to hide this behavior behind the guise of "good." That hypocrisy gives it the extra "oomph" it needs to really succeed.

(As an aside: revenge fantasy flicks like _The Equalizer_ and those "Karens Getting Owned" YouTube videos are playing to this delusion, pure and simple — and as a culture, we eat it up.)

    <br/>
    <em>Oh noes, even MOAR consequences!</em>
</p>

If we travel far enough down this dark path, we will eventually lose even the _pretense_ of being good. That's where the "evil people" find themselves trapped. We ourselves are profoundly susceptible to this slippery slope, whether we like to admit it or not — and the only way to protect against it is to recognize how it works. This is also the only way to free others, instead of mindlessly perpetuating the trap.

> _And no wonder, for even Satan masquerades as an angel of light._ —2 Corinthians 11:14

You know the classic image of the angel and devil sitting on our shoulders? It's _almost_ accurate, except for two things. First, the angel isn't really external to you, but represents your true nature as compassion. In a deep sense, it *is* you. The devil is external; a kind of parasite[^intrinsic]. But it doesn't just whisper obviously-bad ideas in your ear; it alters your very perception and pretends to be your inner angel.

<p align="center" width="100%">
    <img width="300px" src="img/parasite.png"> 
</p>

> _Be kind, for everyone you meet is fighting a great battle._ —Author unknown

Your angel already knows all this, and that even the most "evil" person is merely under the sway of a powerful parasite; one held in place by some "battle" invisible not only to you, but probably even to them. As hard as it may be to evict it, it's never _impossible._ But your devil makes it _appear_ impossible; as though their evil is intrinsic. This way, they seem _fundamentally defective_, and therefore worthy of malice.

Your devil knows that this dehumanization will appear evil to others — because it is the very _essence_ of evil — and so it knows that it will trigger the same reflex in them. It knows this because your devil and theirs are identical.

In fact, it turns out they're more than just identical: they're more like outgrowths of a single dark collective entity that is continually manipulating _all_ of our minds — the Devil, if you will.

<p align="center" width="100%">
    <img width="300px" src="img/shared-devil.png"> 
</p>

This is not just a religious invention: anyone who introspects carefully enough eventually perceives this "distributed malevolent entity" with a kind of intelligence and volition of its own that, even if not _literally_ true, explain its seemingly-coordinated behavior terrifyingly well. 

This "being" continually drives humanity toward various kinds of Armageddon: situations in which everyone is violently proving just how righteous they are. It is why the US is headed toward civil war without anyone recognizing their own complicity, and it explains bitter [divorces](https://www.gottman.com/blog/this-one-thing-is-the-biggest-predictor-of-divorce/) in which each side feels like the exclusive victim / hero. Nearly the whole world is caught in its terrible sway, evil provoking "righteous" retribution at every turn without anyone ever noticing the true source of it all.

It is that primordial "evil global conspiracy" to which all the rest ultimately owe their existence — and _we_ are its unwitting minions. Every attempt to maliciously subdue it "out there" just strengthens it, because such behavior is only ever initiated _by_ it — though it makes us believe that it was initiated by us.

**Any** time you feel malice, hatred, contempt, or even self-righteousness toward another being; any time you see them as fundamentally defective or inferior; any time you are tempted to divide the world into the (fundamentally) "good" and "bad," or to forsake anyone, you are feeding the Beast.

> _For so long as the root of wickedness is hidden, it is strong. But when it is recognized, it is dissolved. When it is revealed, it perishes. ... It is powerful because we have not recognized it._ — The Gospel of Philip

Why is evil so hard to eradicate? What if the very strategy we've been using to fight evil is itself a fiendishly clever form of evil?

The more darkness we see in the world, the more we feel compelled to fight it with a little darkness of our own — except we don't think of ours as "darkness"; we think of it as "righteous."

This is the secret trick by which evil keeps itself alive — and nothing will change until we discover the astonishing truth: that part of us has been in on this trick all along...

---

Let's start by reflecting on [this horrifying story from 2012](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/southamerica/brazil/9005835/Loggers-burned-Amazon-tribe-girl-alive.html):

> _Loggers in Brazil captured an eight-year-old girl from one of the Amazon's last uncontacted tribes and burned her alive as part of a campaign to force the indigenous population from its land [...]_

<p align="center" width="100%">

</p>

Can you feel the profound anger and heartbreak for the girl, her tribe, and humanity? It makes you want to do everything in your power to ensure this kind of thing never happens again — including punishing and maybe even harming the perpetrators if need be. At the same time, you may feel a desire to harm them quite _independently_ of any good it will bring: pure old-fashioned vengeance.

These two motivations — compassion and malice — arise from very different aspects of mind, but can be extremely difficult to tell apart. We usually dress up the latter to make it seem respectable; as though it is "for the greater good." We further confuse the issue by convincing ourselves that it doesn't matter which intention is driving our behavior; that only the result matters — as though our intentions are totally private and have no effect themselves.

This profound confusion is how evil sneaks into the world, undetected.

_Before I speak to your mind, let me speak to your heart. Imagine how dark and twisted a mind must become to feel okay about doing what that logger did. If you introspect deeply enough, you will discover that part of you is eager to shove it deeper into hell, where it "belongs" — and that this violent urge is every bit as malevolent as burning a girl alive._

_The evil in the logger's mind has spread to yours — only it doesn't feel evil; it feels impossibly **righteous**. Until you see clearly how this seduction works, you will never understand the trick by which evil has enslaved our world. You will only succeed in unwittingly spreading it._ 

_What the world desperately needs is our fierce, uncompromising Love; not our contempt[^contempt]. They are **not** the same. One is the evil twin of the other. Everything hinges on seeing this clearly._

We can't predict all the downstream effects of even our tiniest behaviors, but we _can_ know whether we are being totally honest about our intentions — and this matters far more than you know.

<p align="center" width="100%">
    <img width="300px" src="img/half-evil.png"> 
</p>

When we act maliciously, we secretly have a dual intent. On one hand, we are trying to appear righteous, as though we are fighting evil. On the other hand, part of us is trying to telegraph our own inner darkness to the evildoer — as if to show them that we are capable of everything that they are, and more.

We may not be conscious of this second communication, but our subconscious mind ensures that the message gets through — to our target, our allies, and bystanders alike. It may strike enough fear in our "victim" to pause their misbehavior (in public, anyway), but it also has a deeper effect: it assures them that _darkness is where the power is._ All who witness this behavior will therefore invite the darkness to further colonize their minds. It _will_ manifest in some form or another.

The world becomes darker as a result. We probably won't notice this, but even if we do, we will either blame it on them, or else write it off as "unfortunate" collateral damage. But it isn't actually an unfortunate side effect of our well-intentioned behavior: it was actually the _goal_, and was secretly orchestrated by a sinister aspect within our minds. The way this works is _insanely_ clever.

<p align="center" width="100%">
    <img width="300px" src="img/evil-above-world.png"> 
</p>

People are only able to misbehave due to a kind of self-deception: part of them knows perfectly well when what they're doing is wrong, but that "wrongness" is cleverly hidden from conscious self-reflection. We all know what this state is like: every one of us has skirted our conscience, pretending either that we couldn't hear it or that we could safely ignore it.

Try to recall what that state is like. In that bizarre schism of mind, you simultaneously _know_ and yet somehow _don't_. **This is the secret mechanism behind all the evil there ever was**.

We believe that we can violently force others to own up to their self-deception, but this usually backfires: they simply perceive _us_ as evil in return, and not having the moral authority to be judging anybody. Why on Earth would they feel compelled to repent or even introspect? No; they now feel compelled to violently force us to admit to _our_ evil.

Part of us secretly knew this would happen. In fact, it planned it. We _wanted_ them to react poorly, so that we could prove to ourselves just how bad they are, so that we could unleash more of our righteous fury. Think about it: isn't it much more viscerally satisfying to see bad people "get owned" than to have a change of heart, even if the latter is better for the world? We _want_ a fight.

We aren't telegraphing our darkness to _suppress_ theirs, but to _amplify_ it. If you introspect carefully enough, you can practically _feel_ the darkness in your mind reaching out to give theirs a secret handshake. Part of us knows perfectly well that we are doing this, but we carefully hide it from ourselves. Sound familiar? They weren't exactly _wrong_ to perceive us as "evil" — we are, indeed, caught in precisely the same trap that we are violently judging them for.

If we could just see how easily we deceive ourselves, we would understand the mechanism that enables _all_ misbehavior, and this would empower to do something useful about it. Instead, we continually get sucked into the same trap that humanity has been in for millennia.

It's not _harming_ them that was the problem (because harm is sometimes necessary), but the malice with which we did it. It is entirely possible to harm people out of fierce compassion, but it feels **nothing** like malice: the crucial connection to our Heart has not been severed. Others can sense our profoundly benevolent intent, and this prevents their evil from finding the "hook" that it uses to justify itself. Instead, it is confronted with a blinding Light that can only weaken it, if only imperceptibly — the _true_ "righteousness" that we thought we were accessing through malice.

</p>

If it is really this simple, then why haven't we (as a species) figured it out and changed our ways?

Part of us _knows_ that we're not intrinsically better than anyone — but given how low people can sink, this is painful to admit, so we hide it from ourselves. We use malice to keep people trapped in delusion, so that we can prove our morally superiority. Unfortunately, shoving people into Hell is hardly "morally superior," so we hide this intention from ourselves, too. This results in an ever-tightening noose of deception that collapses in on itself like a black hole, preventing us from ever suspecting what we're really doing. We are in too deep.

That's why revenge fantasy films like _The Equalizer_ are so popular: they exist only to keep us firmly ensconced in this warm delusion where we are the immaculate "good guys" fighting the hordes of pure evil "out there." Think of them as physical manifestations of our collective shadow.

<p align="center" width="100%">
    <img width="300px" src="img/equalizer.png"> 
    <br/>
    <em>... only *good* consequences, we swear!</em>
</p>

If we travel far enough down this dark path, we will eventually lose even the _pretense_ of being good. That's where the "evil people" are trapped. We ourselves are profoundly susceptible to this slippery slope, whether we like to admit it or not — and the only way to protect against it is to recognize how it works. This is also the only way to free others, instead of mindlessly perpetuating the trap.

> _And no wonder, for even Satan masquerades as an angel of light._ —2 Corinthians 11:14

You know the classic image of the angel and devil sitting on our shoulders? It's _almost_ accurate, except for two things. First, the angel isn't really external to you, but represents your true nature as compassion. In a deep sense, it *is* you. The devil is external; a kind of parasite[^intrinsic]. But it doesn't just whisper obviously-bad ideas in your ear; it alters your very perception and pretends to be your inner angel.

<p align="center" width="100%">
    <img width="300px" src="img/parasite.png"> 
</p>

> _Be kind, for everyone you meet is fighting a great battle._ —Author unknown

Your angel already knows all this, and that even the most "evil" person is merely under the sway of a powerful parasite; one held in place by some "battle" invisible not only to you, but probably even to them. As hard as it may be to evict theirs, it's never _impossible._ But your devil makes it _appear_ impossible; as though their evil is intrinsic. This way, they seem _fundamentally defective_, and therefore worthy of malice.

Your devil knows that this dehumanization will appear evil to others — because it is the very _essence_ of evil — and so it knows that it will trigger the same reflex in them. It knows this because your devil and theirs are identical. They are working in tandem, each provoking the other.

In fact, it turns out they're more than just identical: if you look carefully, you will see that they are more like outgrowths of a single dark collective entity that is continually manipulating _all_ of our minds — the Devil, if you will.

<p align="center" width="100%">
    <img width="300px" src="img/shared-devil.png"> 
</p>

This is not just a wacky religious invention: anyone who introspects carefully enough eventually perceives this "distributed malevolent entity" with an apparent intelligence and volition of its own that, even if not _literally_ true, explain its seemingly-coordinated behavior terrifyingly well. 

This "being" continually drives humanity toward various kinds of Armageddon: situations in which everyone is violently proving just how righteous they are. It is why the US is headed toward civil war without anyone recognizing their own complicity, and it explains bitter [divorces](https://www.gottman.com/blog/this-one-thing-is-the-biggest-predictor-of-divorce/) in which each side feels like the exclusive victim / hero. Nearly the whole world is caught in its terrible sway, evil provoking "righteous" retribution at every turn without anyone ever noticing the true source of it all.

This is that primordial "evil global conspiracy" to which all the rest ultimately owe their existence — and _we_ are its unwitting minions. Every attempt to maliciously subdue it "out there" just strengthens it, because such behavior is only ever initiated _by_ it — though it makes us believe that it was initiated by us.

**Any** time you feel malice, hatred, contempt, or even self-righteousness toward another being; any time you see them as fundamentally defective or inferior; any time you are tempted to divide the world into the (fundamentally) "good" and "bad," or to forsake anyone, you are feeding the Beast.

<p align="center" width="100%">
    <img width="300px" src="img/good-vs-bad.png"> 
</p>

To be clear: there are surely groups of particularly deluded people who conspire to cause great harm, but their existence wouldn't be possible if the rest of us weren't busy feeding the source — and conversely, it is _completely inevitable_ given that we are. **We must hold such people accountable**, but when we do this with contempt, we are reinforcing the very conditions that _compel_ their existence.

If you could trace all the subtle threads of causality weaving through the world, you would find your finger in countless evil pies.

<p align="center" width="100%">
    <img width="300px" src="img/evil-conspiracy.png">

Our true enemy is not other people, but the dark "entity" that has captured _all_ of our minds. By keeping our attention fixated perpetually outward, it ensures that we never introspect deeply enough to discover our own complicity in keeping it alive.

This is roughly what the Buddhists call the ego: the collection of habits we have developed to overlook our intimate interconnection with all of reality; to elevate ourselves at its expense. The reason it is so hard to discover is that it [pretends to _be_ you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gg8JYYyWSPg) — but it is not your friend.

> *The shadow is a moral problem that challenges the whole ego-personality, for no one can become conscious of the shadow without considerable moral effort. To become conscious of it involves recognizing the dark aspects of the personality as present and real. This act is the essential condition for any kind of self-knowledge.* —Carl Jung

The only way out of this trap is to see beyond the ego, to your fundamentally compassionate nature. When you see this, you cannot help but see it in everyone else, too — because in an astonishing and heart-wrenching sense, [they **are** you](unity.md). This perception is not fully unveiled until enlightenment, but we can all taste it at all times. Ultimately, all self-deception boils down to willful ignorance of this fact — and all unkindness reinforces it. Why do I say "willful" ignorance? Because you eventually discover that _part of you has known this all along._ Think of this piece as a reminder.

From that clarity of perception, you cannot possibly harbor malice or contempt. You see it for the utter nonsense that it is. This enables you to perceive the hidden causes of people's self-deception, allowing you to do something real about it. That's what compassion (aka kindness) is.

To repeat: it doesn't mean being _nice_. It can outwardly be as fierce (or violent[^dalai-lama-gun], or even _apparently_ contemptuous) as the situation warrants, but these behaviors come from a completely different source, and have a completely different effect on all minds involved — rippling outward into the world in ways that we can't see or predict. Your refusal to join the darkness — especially when it is most tempting — serves as a powerful example for all of humanity.

_This_ is why wise people urge compassion for evildoers: the only alternative is to join them in evil.

To be clear, compassion doesn't always know what the most beneficial behavior _is_; it merely ensures that you are not falling into the many seductive traps of your darkness. Determining the most effective behavior requires _wisdom_, which is a vast topic, and beyond the scope of this work. Compassion may be no easier to acquire than wisdom, but it is much simpler: there is a single place within your mind that you can turn to and _know_ whether you are allying with the darkness or the Light. 

So much trouble could be avoided if we just remembered to **look** — especially when we were most convinced that we didn't need to.

> *Such a man knows that whatever is wrong in the world is also in himself, and if he only learns to deal with his own shadow, he has done something real for the world. He has succeeded in shouldering at least an infinitesimal part of the gigantic, unsolved problems of our day.* —Carl Jung

</p>

Enlightenment may be a lofty goal to expect of humanity, but we can start small, by changing social norms. We can teach our children the difference between "kind" and "nice," and explain the sense in which kindness is _always_ the right motivation in all circumstances. We can refuse to join our allies when they're caught up in the traps of contempt and malice, and serve as an example of a better way.

Please never lose contact with your Heart. It is the greatest gift you have to offer this weary world.

## Footnotes

[^contempt]: Specifically, we mean (genuine) contempt for *people*. Contempt for ideas or behaviors can actually be healthy, as perhaps can (apparent) contempt that is rooted in genuine compassion.

[^intrinsic]: You may wonder how it is possible to know that evil is not intrinsic to other people's minds, but for our purposes it's more important to see that (1) our _perception_ of their intrinsic defectiveness is our own projection, and (2) our own darkness gives us the capacity to devolve into a condition in which others would be utterly convinced that _ours_ is intrinsic.

[^dalai-lama-gun]: The Dalai Lama was once asked what you should do if a gunman is trying to shoot you and you have a gun. [He said "shoot back."](https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/dalai-gun/)

> _For so long as the root of wickedness is hidden, it is strong. But when it is recognized, it is dissolved. When it is revealed, it perishes. ... It is powerful because we have not recognized it._ — The Gospel of Philip

The greatest trick the Devil ever pulled was to convince you that he doesn't exist _within your own mind_. The truth is that the more certain you are that you are immune to evil, the more surely you are already under its powerful grip without realizing it.

---

Take a moment to reflect on what's wrong with the world, and bring to mind the people responsible. Don't they seem _fundamentally morally defective_? Do you feel contempt or maybe even malice? It feels like those emotions are there to help you _fight_ evil, but they are actually manifestations _of_ evil. While feeling them, you can only darken the world, even as you are flawlessly convinced that you're helping.

This is not something I can convince you of, so I won't even try. But here's the thing: part of you already knows it. You don't enjoy mocking or shaming your enemies to help them (or anyone else) see the light, or to make the world a better place. You do it to make yourself feel superior. It may temporarily suppress their misbehavior, but it _will_ increase the net hostility and polarization in the world. You may tell yourself that it won't, or that it's their fault if it does, or that the benefits outweigh the drawbacks, but part of you knows that these are just lame excuses for malicious behavior. This is true of _all_ forms of unkindness. This example is just one among many.

This isn't an attack on you. But something within you is actively preventing you from consciously acknowledging the effects of your words and actions. Why? 

Part of you _knows_ that darkness exists within you, and it does everything in its power to shield this horrifying fact from your conscious mind. It makes you actively seek out the evil in others, because viciously attacking theirs takes attention off of your own. Said another way: something within us _needs_ other people to be "bad," so that we can know ourselves as "good" by comparison. So we subconsciously do things that _provoke_ evil in others, unbeknownst to our conscious minds.

<p align="center" width="100%">
    <img width="300px" src="img/half-evil.png"> 
</p>

Think back to a time when you disobeyed your conscience, pretending either that you couldn't hear it or that you could safely ignore it. When this happens, a schism is created in your mind: part of you knows _perfectly well_ that you're doing wrong, but that knowledge is cleverly hidden from conscious self-reflection. It is then easy to convince others that you _don't_ know, because you have convinced _yourself_. **All evil relies on this mechanism of self-deception**.

Evil (almost) never _feels_ evil. That's the most terrifying thing. One day you wake up and discover that nearly everything you've been doing to "fight evil" has only been amplifying it — and worse, that **part of you always knew this, even as you were doing it**. Until you see that this is going on within you (and clean it up), you have no hope of helping fix the evil "out there." You can only create more, while being supremely confident that you're helping.

The longer you let this condition fester, the more you must hide it from yourself, because the more you subconsciously recognize the horrifying (and increasing) similarity between what you're doing and what you're accusing others of doing: being cruel and pretending that it's okay. Very quickly you find yourself "in too deep" and completely unable to detect this, even when it is pointed out. In fact, when people _do_ point it out, your subconscious registers them as enemies, to "protect" you.

<p align="center" width="100%">
    <img width="300px" src="img/devil-vs-devil.png">

This is where the "bad people" find themselves. Something in them is shielding the _wrongness_ of their behavior from conscious self-reflection — and the more contemptuously you judge them for it, the more they will perceive _you_ as evil and dig in their heels. You will take this as confirmation of _their_ evil, but they are correctly recognizing the same self-deceptive mechanism in you that is operating within them. Part of you is baiting them into seeing you as evil, to justify your contempt — and this _is_ evil. This is how our darkness gets us to escalate violence while blaming it on others.

(The brilliance of this ruse is too amazing not to linger on for a moment. The only thing needed to create new evil is to _appear evil_, because this triggers malice in others. But go ahead and _try_ to appear evil. You can't do it, can you? You know that you're faking it. Now give someone a dehumanizing glare. Put as much contempt and malice into it as you can. There — that feels evil, doesn't it? They can feel it too. Now all that remains is to hide from yourself that you're trying to induce this feeling in others. _Voilà_. This is how we create evil while feeling righteous about it.)

The reason that the "bad people" need to shield their misbehavior is that _part of them doesn't want to be doing wrong._ This means that they are not _fundamentally_ defective. You don't have to take my word for it, but can actually learn to perceive this. If you manage to take your own self-deception mechanism offline, it feels exactly like you'd imagine feeling if you were suddenly freed from a demonic possession. When it lifts, you see that the darkness is not intrinsic to any mind, but has very cleverly commandeered them. We perceive it as intrinsic only to justify our contempt.

To be fair, there seems to be a tiny percentage of people who have invited the demon in, for whom the description "evil" really does capture something important. They pose a much greater challenge, because a large part of them _does_ want it. Being "kind" to them in the conventional sense can indeed be dangerous. And yet the very _deepest_ part of them does not want it. Again, once you see exactly what "it" is, you understand why _nobody_ ultimately could. Think of it as a form of Stockholm syndrome. If you really want to defeat evil, you must want them to be free of it, too.

When we meet (or even hear about) such people, we often experience the overwhelming urge to hate them, but this is the ultimate trap. What we're feeling is the urge to _shove them deeper into the abyss where they "belong."_ The more thoroughly the darkness has ensnared others, the more it behaves like a black hole, sucking away our own light. If we are not alert to this trap, we enter their dark space of mind, in which the deepest evil feels impossibly righteous. Don't fall for it.

How can you know if your self-deception mechanism has "gone offline"? You will clearly perceive your profound interconnectedness with the world. The "great battles" that others are facing will suddenly become obvious, as will your role in having exacerbated them. Malice, contempt [^contempt], and self-righteousness will be recognized as profoundly delusional. You will remember that you are not fundamentally better (or worse) than anyone, and that pretending you are just makes the world darker.

This perspective is not an altered state of mind, but something that is always there yet somehow curiously hidden. It is your deepest and most natural mode of knowing, which is how you will know that you can trust it.

---

The root of the problem was the desire to be special; what the Buddhists call the _ego_. For those of us with a self-image as "good people," this manifests as the need to be _relatively_ good; i.e., good in comparison to others. This duality forces us to continually create "bad people" in all sorts of subtle ways that we can't consciously recognize. This process only comes to an end when we discover the _absolute_ good within. This is something that we cannot take any credit for[^credit]. Instead, we can only feel profound gratitude for whatever grace allowed us to discover it, and heartbreak that it still remains so deeply hidden in others. The hardest part is watching the whole world being casually cruel to each other, not realizing which "team" they are secretly fighting for. It inspires a fierce determination to fight the "possession" that has captured people's minds, instead of deepening it like we've unwittingly been doing.

This doesn't mean that you will suddenly be nice or lovey-dovey toward evildoers. You may still need to be fierce, or perhaps even violent[^dalai-lama-gun]. Mockery, shaming, or even _apparent_ contempt might still be useful. But it will be in the service of _freeing_ people from the darkness, not pushing them further in. It is a kind of "tough love," and feels _nothing_ like the antagonism that you normally feel when "fighting evil." You are still "connected to your heart." **That is what is most crucial.** Others can sense the profoundly benevolent intent (even if only subconsciously), and it makes _all the difference in the world_.

To put it another way, in every interaction you have two options: to either encourage the Light in others, or to attack their darkness. Encouraging their Light isn't about being _nice_. It is about being completely unwilling to abandon yours under _any circumstances_ — including the one that their darkness is presently using to test you. It is looking for a "hook" in your mind that it can use to justify itself — some sign that even you, the "good person," are ultimately just faking it. If you are unwilling to abandon your integrity even then, the blinding brilliance of your Light _will_ tame their darkness at least a little. Or, said differently, it will remind their Light that it has a partner in the fight.

This is authentic kindness (aka compassion). It is "radical" in that it contradicts our usual intuition, that some people "deserve" our compassion and others don't. It could never be the case that some people deserve to be shoved further into the abyss while others deserve to be freed from it.

<p align="center" width="100%">
    <img width="300px" src="img/good-vs-bad.png"> 
</p>

I know it feels like some people don't _have_ an inner Light to encourage, but this is just an illusion that our darkness uses to get its foot in the door. Once it has tricked us into dividing the world into fundamentally good and bad people — which feels like the most natural thing in the world — it has gained nearly unfettered access to our minds. Then, it is only a matter of time until the right conditions manifest that license us to commit unspeakable horror in the name of "good."[^genocide]

It is this devil that tricks you into seeing other people as _fundamentally_ defective, instead of seeing that they are being manipulated by _their_ devils (which is something that your angel _can_ see). Our devils continually trigger each other — not because they are enemies, but _because they are allies_. This is how they strengthen each other. Evil never actually fights evil; it only pretends to, to create more of itself under the guise of good.

In this way, our devils behave more like a single "distributed organism" — the _Devil_, if you will — signaling to itself through the vast network of human minds. It leverages our collective intelligence to produce horrifying outcomes that none of us claim to want, yet which are the inevitable result of our cumulative self-deception.

<p align="center" width="100%">
    <img width="300px" src="img/shared-devil.png">

You know how it is said that "the elites" are tricking us into hating each other to take attention off of themselves? Doesn't this make you hate them? Could it be that there is something even more subtle and wicked that is tricking us into hating them, to keep our attention off of _it_? Indeed there is.

You know how people sometimes suspect that there's an "evil global conspiracy" lurking in the shadows, responsible for all the world's ills? They are not crazy. They are subconsciously sensing something genuine. There is an aspect of all of our minds communicating with itself beneath our conscious thresholds, shielding itself from discovery in _insanely_ clever ways. The closer we get to discovering it, the more it tricks us into projecting it "out there," so that we viciously attack others instead of defeating the one component of it that is within our own grasp. It stays alive because each one of us is valiantly _protecting_ our portion of it, believing that it's our friend.

<p align="center" width="100%">

This "dark entity" continually drives humanity toward various kinds of Armageddon: situations in which everyone gets to violently prove just how righteous they are. It is why the US is headed toward civil war without anyone recognizing their own complicity, and explains bitter [divorces](https://www.gottman.com/blog/this-one-thing-is-the-biggest-predictor-of-divorce/) in which each side feels like the exclusive victim / hero. Nearly the whole world is caught in its terrible sway, evil provoking "righteous" retribution at every turn, without anyone ever suspecting the true source of it all.

This is not just a wacky theory. As best I can tell, everyone who introspects carefully enough eventually discovers this. Something within your very mind is conspiring with the darkness in others to produce a kind of Hell on Earth. Every time you feel contempt for _anyone_, your devil is reaching out to give theirs a kind of secret handshake; a sinister agreement to keep this world bound in darkness. I have used the word "subconscious" to describe this activity, but that's not quite accurate. **It is completely accessible to consciousness, if you know how to look.** It is something you are _doing._ [The Devil hides in the very last place you would ever look](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gg8JYYyWSPg).

It is impossible to overstate the shock of discovering, for the first time, that you have _always_ been in on the "evil global conspiracy." It is terrifying, heartbreaking, and humbling all at once. Every single act of unkindness we've ever perpetrated has been in the service of the Beast, even when we told ourselves that it was noble. This includes not only being cruel to other people, but _all_ acts in which we skirt our conscience — such as when we "shave off a little extra" for ourselves at the expense of others, or take pleasure in others' suffering, or countless other "innocent" misbehaviors.

To be clear: there are surely groups of particularly "endarkened" people who conspire to cause great harm, but their existence wouldn't be possible if the rest of us weren't feeding the source — and conversely, it is _completely inevitable_ given that we are. **We must hold such people accountable** — but when we do it with contempt, we are reinforcing the very conditions that _compel_ their existence. They will continue to exist for as long as we each cherish the "right" to harbor a little darkness ourselves.

<p align="center" width="100%">
    <img width="300px" src="img/evil-conspiracy.png"> 
</p>

Ironically, we have no leg to stand on if we're still feeling self-righteous, because that is the surest sign that we are still under the demon's malevolent sway. This is precisely the opposite of what that emotion tells us — that the more we feel it, the more _free_ of evil we must surely be. It is actually impossible to fight evil from this place, because self-deception can only ever create more of itself.

Our true enemy is not other people, but the dark "entity" that has captured _all_ of our minds. By keeping our attention fixated perpetually outward, it ensures that we never introspect deeply enough to discover our own complicity in keeping it alive.

Perhaps MLK said it best:

> *Darkness cannot drive out darkness; only light can do that. Hate cannot drive out hate; only love can do that.*

Ultimately, evil is not actually a _presence_ (like it seems), but an _absence_. The absence of what? Of the perception of the profound interconnectedness of all Life; of our fundamental equality with others. Ultimately, all self-deception boils down to willful ignorance of this truth. It is simply not possible to reduce the darkness in the world by withholding our own Light; by leveraging our contempt, malice, hatred, etc. That is an insidious trap that we _must_ see through if humanity is to survive.

Your Light is capable of accomplishing everything you _think_ you need your darkness for, and much more — but there is a price that must be paid: you will have to give up the illusion of being special; one of the few "good people" fighting the hordes of evil. You must relinquish the sinister pleasure of watching your enemies "get owned." In short, you must give up self-deception.

In exchange, you will discover how to move toward the world you actually want in your deepest heart of hearts. It is well worth the price, and more.

[^contempt]: Specifically, we mean (genuine) contempt for *people*. Contempt for ideas or behaviors can actually be healthy, as perhaps can (apparent) contempt that is rooted in genuine compassion.

[^credit]: In fact, taking credit for it is one way to be sure that you haven't found it.

[^dalai-lama-gun]: The Dalai Lama was once asked what you should do if a gunman is trying to shoot you and you have a gun. [He said "shoot back."](https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/dalai-gun/)

[^genocide]: This is what permits genocide. The Nazis referred to Jews as 'vermin,' and during the genocide in Rwanda, Tutsis were referred to as 'cockroaches.' This is a common pattern throughout history. Perhaps paradoxically, the only way to be sure that you'd never do such a thing is that you don't feel contempt for the people who have.

What if nearly everything you're doing to "fight evil" is actually strengthening it — and moreover, what if part of you already knows this, but is actively concealing it from your conscious mind? What if the difficulty admitting this to yourself stems from the _very same mechanism_ that prevents the "bad people" from acknowledging the full implications of _their_ actions?

These are provocative questions, but they point to an astonishing truth — one that is excruciatingly painful yet ultimately liberating. The Devil hides in the very last place you would ever look.

---

Take a moment to reflect on what's wrong with the world, and bring to mind the people responsible. Don't they seem _fundamentally morally defective_? Do you feel contempt or maybe even malice? It feels like those emotions are there to help you _fight_ evil, but this is a sinister lie. They only to help you _darken_ the world while making you feel flawlessly convinced that you're helping.

This is not something I can convince you of, so I won't even try. But here's the thing: part of you already knows it. You don't enjoy mocking or shaming your enemies to help them (or anyone else) "see the light," or to make the world a better place. You do it to make yourself feel superior. It may temporarily suppress their misbehavior, but it _will_ increase the net hostility and polarization in the world. You may tell yourself that it won't, or that it's their fault if it does, or that the benefits outweigh the drawbacks, but part of you knows that these are just lame excuses for malicious behavior. This is true of _all_ forms of unkindness. This example is just one among countless.

This isn't an attack on you, though it may feel like one. That defensiveness is hiding something crucial — something that I promise you want to see. An aspect of your mind is actively preventing you from consciously acknowledging the effects of your words and actions. Why? 

Part of you _knows_ that darkness exists within you, and does everything in its power to shield this horrifying truth from your conscious mind. It makes you hyperfocus on the faults in others, because viciously attacking _their_ evil takes attention off of your own. Said another way: something within us _needs_ other people to be "bad," so that we can know ourselves as "good" by comparison. So we subconsciously do things to _provoke_ evil in others while convincing ourselves this is righteous.

Think back to a time when you disobeyed your conscience, pretending either that you couldn't hear it or that you could safely ignore it. We've all done this. When this happens, a schism is created in your mind: part of you knows _perfectly well_ that you're doing wrong, but that knowledge is cleverly shielded from conscious self-reflection. It is then easy to convince others that you _don't_ know, because you have convinced _yourself_. **All evil relies on this mechanism of self-deception**. We see it easily in others, but in ourselves only when it's convenient to our self-image.

Evil (almost) never _feels_ evil. That's the most terrifying thing. It's not until _after_ you wake up from this self-induced trance that you discover just how badly you were fooling yourself. People were even trying to _warn_ you, but in that grotesque state, you couldn't see what they were pointing at. In fact, the harder they tried to show you, the more you perceived _them_ as evil, crazy, or stupid — which only deepened your self-deceptive trance. But most horrifically of all, you see that some part of you always knew that you were doing wrong, even as you pretended not to.

This is where the "bad people" find themselves. Something in them is shielding the _wrongness_ of their behavior from conscious self-reflection — and the more contemptuously you judge them for it, the more they will perceive _you_ as evil and dig in their heels. You will take this as confirmation of _their_ evil, but they are actually recognizing the same self-deceptive mechanism in you that is operating within them – the very thing you see as "evil." **This whole sordid dance was choreographed by the darkness in _both_ of your minds, to perpetuate itself without either of you catching on.** You both come away feeling more than justified.

Something within you _wants_ to push people further into the dark, but doesn't want to be caught doing so. This is malevolent. People can subconsciously sense this intention, and this by itself is enough to provoke the darkness in their minds. Mission accomplished; more darkness was created without you having to do anything provably evil. All it took was your dark motivation — something that you can trivially deny, even to yourself. It is this dark pattern that "good people" employ to maintain their self-image. _Genuinely_ good people are those who have learned to stop doing it. They _never_ look down on others, because this is the surest sign of brewing self-deception.

The reason that the "bad people" need to shield their misbehavior from consciousness is that _part of them doesn't want to be doing wrong._ This means that they are not _fundamentally_ defective. We perceive their badness as intrinsic only to justify our contempt, which in turn exists only to create more. You don't have to take my word for it, but can actually learn to perceive this. If you manage to take your own self-deception mechanism offline for even a moment, it feels exactly like you'd imagine feeling if you were suddenly freed from a demonic possession. You clearly perceive how this "demon" has very cleverly commandeered people's minds.

To be fair, there does seem to be a tiny percentage of people who have consciously welcomed the demon in, for whom the description "evil" really does capture something important. Such people pose a unique challenge. Being "kind" to them in the conventional sense can indeed be dangerous. And yet the very _deepest_ aspect of their mind does not want it. Again, it is only once you see exactly what "it" is that you understand why _nobody_ ultimately could. Think of it like a form of Stockholm syndrome. If you want to defeat evil, you must want them to be free of it, too.

When we meet (or even hear about) such people, we often experience the overwhelming urge to hate them, but this is the ultimate trap. It is their darkness inviting ours to treat them in a way that will drive them further into its clutches — and we very often take the bait. How could we not? It is like a gift-wrapped present: the opportunity to manifest our darkest tendencies in a way that we can convince ourselves and others is unmistakably _good._ 

Seeing this all clearly turns your whole world upside-down. We are hating people for their susceptibility to the world's most fiendish mind-virus — the one responsible for our very hatred. **Any time you feel contempt for _anyone_ for _any reason whatsoever_, your mind is secretly gearing up to elevate or otherwise enrich yourself at the world's expense.** We are all hypocrites, and contempt is _always_ a sign that your mind is hiding some hypocrisy from yourself.

Until this becomes _common knowledge_ (in the [technical sense](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/common-knowledge/) — where everyone knows that everyone knows that everyone knows...), humanity will continue to tie itself up in horrifying knots while pretending to be freeing itself from them. (This is exemplified by "pseudo-kind" ideologies, in which people claim to be helping one person or group by demonizing another. This *always* triggers a counter-ideology, and not by accident.) Unfortunately, our self-deception prevents us from making this _common knowledge_, no matter how clearly it is pointed out. This piece is an attempt.

What happens when your self-deception mechanism to "goes offline"? 

Your whole carefully-constructed reality — and the hierarchy of blame that scaffolds it — suddenly comes crashing down. The "great battles" that others are facing suddenly become obvious, as does your unfortunate role in having perpetuated them. It is impossible to communicate how painful the full epiphany is — to see what a hypocrite you've been; to be forcefully shown just how much of the world's darkness can be traced back to your own decisions to be unkind. But it's not all gloom and doom.

You then perceive your profound interconnectedness with the world. Malice, contempt, and self-righteousness are recognized as profoundly delusional. Seeing how confused people actually are, it is impossible to feel a trace of ill-will. You remember the sense in which you are not fundamentally better (or worse) than anyone, and why pretending that you are always makes the world darker. You feel boundless love for all of reality, recognizing your inseparability from every particle of it.

This perspective is not an altered state of consciousness, but something that is always there yet somehow curiously hidden. It feels like coming home to a place you never left. It is your deepest and most natural mode of knowing, which is how you will know that you can trust it.

There, you see that the root of the problem was the desire to be special; what the Buddhists call the _ego_. For those of us with a self-image as "good people," this manifests as the need to be _relatively_ good; i.e., good in comparison to others. This duality forces us to continually create "bad people" in all sorts of subtle ways that we can't consciously recognize. This process only comes to an end when we discover the _absolute_ good within.

This "absolute good" is something that we cannot take any credit for[^credit]. Instead, we can only feel profound gratitude for whatever grace allowed us to discover it, and heartbreak that it still remains so deeply hidden in others. The hardest part is watching the whole world being casually cruel to each other, unaware of which "team" they are secretly fighting for. It inspires a fierce determination to end the "possession" that has captured people's minds, instead of deepening it like we've unwittingly been doing. We clearly see the face of our true nemesis for the first time.

This doesn't mean that you will suddenly become nice or lovey-dovey toward evildoers. You may still need to be fierce, or perhaps even violent[^dalai-lama-gun]. Mockery, shaming, or even _apparent_ contempt might still be useful tools in your arsenal. But these will be in the service of _freeing_ people from the darkness, not pushing them further in. It is a kind of "tough love," and feels _nothing_ like the self-righteous antagonism that we normally feel when "fighting evil." You are still "connected to your heart." **That is what is most crucial.** Others can sense the profoundly benevolent intent (even if only subconsciously), and it makes _all the difference in the world_.

In every interaction you have two options: to either encourage the Light in others, or to fight their darkness with yours. **Encouraging their Light has nothing to do with being _nice_**. It is about being completely unwilling to abandon your own Light under _any circumstances_ — including the one that their darkness is presently testing you with. Their darkness is looking for a "hook" in your mind that it can use to justify itself — some sign that even you, the "good person," are weak to its seduction. If you refuse to abandon your integrity even then, the fierceness of your Light subjugates their darkness. They subconsciously remember that _the Light_ isn't just a myth.

This is authentic kindness (aka compassion). It is "radical" for two reasons. First, it contradicts our usual intuition that some people "deserve" it while others don't. It could never be the case that some people deserve to be shoved further into the abyss while others deserve to be freed from it. Second, it need not look anything like "kindness" in the conventional sense (though most often, it will). It certainly doesn't have to be soft or weak.

<p align="center" width="100%">
    <img width="300px" src="img/good-vs-bad.png"> 
</p>

I know it feels like some people don't _have_ an inner Light to encourage, but this is just an illusion that our darkness uses to get its foot in the door. By the time it has tricked us into dividing the world into fundamentally "good" and "bad" people — which feels like the most natural thing in the world — it has already infected the deepest aspect of our minds. Then, it can bide its time fostering conditions that will get us to commit unspeakable horror in the name of "good."[^genocide]

> _And no wonder, for even Satan masquerades as an angel of light._ —2 Corinthians 11:14

It is said that "the elites" are tricking us into hating each other to take attention off of themselves. Doesn't this make you hate them? Could it be that there is an even more subtle and wicked puppetmaster that is tricking us into hating _them_, so that we never discover _it_?

Indeed there is. No matter how much power the elites wield, it is _nothing_ compared to that of the dark entity pulling even their strings.

<p align="center" width="100%">
    <img width="300px" src="img/angel-devil-shoulders.png"> 
</p>

You know the classic image of the angel and devil sitting on our shoulders? It's _almost_ accurate, except for two things. First, the angel isn't external to you, but represents your intrinsically compassionate nature. Second, the devil _is_ extrinsic; it is a kind of parasite. But it doesn't just whisper obviously-bad ideas in your ear; it alters your very perception and pretends to _be_ your inner angel.

<p align="center" width="100%">
    <img width="300px" src="img/parasite.png"> 
</p>

It is this devil that tricks you into seeing other people as _fundamentally_ defective, instead of seeing that they are being manipulated by _their_ devils (which is something that your angel can always see). Our devils continually trigger each other — not because they are enemies, but _because they are allies_. Evil never actually fights evil; it only pretends to, to create more of itself.

<p align="center" width="100%">
    <img width="300px" src="img/shared-devil.png"> 
</p>

You know how people sometimes suspect that there's an "evil global conspiracy" lurking in the shadows, running the show behind the scenes? They are not crazy. They are subconsciously sensing something genuine: there is indeed an aspect of all of our minds communicating with itself beneath our conscious thresholds, shielding itself from discovery in _insanely_ clever ways. Its greatest trick is to prevent us from suspecting, let alone detecting, our own role in keeping it alive.

Our individual devils are working together almost like a single "distributed organism" — the _Devil_, if you will. Each of us suspects its existence, but we all view it from different angles. No two people fully agree on who's ultimately pulling the strings of the evil plot. The truth is that _nobody_ is — and _everybody_ is.

<p align="center" width="100%">
    <img width="300px" src="img/evil-above-world.png"> 
</p>

This "dark entity" continually drives humanity toward various kinds of Armageddon: situations in which everyone is violently expressing their own righteous fury to defeat the darkness "out there." It is why the US is headed toward civil war without anyone suspecting their own complicity, and explains bitter [divorces](https://www.gottman.com/blog/this-one-thing-is-the-biggest-predictor-of-divorce/) in which each side feels like the exclusive victim / hero. Nearly the whole world is caught in its terrible sway, evil provoking "righteous" retribution at every turn, without anyone ever noticing the true source of it all.

This is not just a wacky theory, or just a metaphor. As best I can tell, everyone who introspects carefully enough eventually discovers this. Something within your very mind is conspiring with the darkness in others to produce a kind of Hell on Earth. Every time you feel contempt for _anyone_, your "devil" is reaching out to give theirs a kind of secret handshake; a sinister agreement to keep this world bound in darkness. I have used the word "subconscious" to describe this activity, but that's not quite accurate. **It is completely accessible to consciousness, if you know how to look.** It is something you are _doing._ [The Devil hides in the last place you would ever look](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gg8JYYyWSPg); the innermost chamber of your mind.

It is impossible to overstate the shock of discovering, for the first time, that you have _always_ been in on the "evil global conspiracy." It is terrifying, heartbreaking, and humbling all at once. Every single act of unkindness we've ever perpetrated has been in the service of the Beast, even when we told ourselves that we had "good intentions." This includes not only being cruel to other people, but _all_ acts in which we skirt our conscience — such as when we "shave off a little extra" for ourselves at the expense of others, or take pleasure in others' suffering, or countless other "innocent" misbehaviors. Every time we do this, we are strengthening each other's demons.

To be clear: there are surely groups of particularly "endarkened" people who consciously conspire to cause great harm, and **we must hold such people accountable** — but when we do so with contempt, we are secretly (and on a subconscious level, _knowingly_) reinforcing the very conditions that effectively compel their existence. They cannot be defeated without our seeing this.

<p align="center" width="100%">
    <img width="300px" src="img/evil-conspiracy.png"> 
</p>

Ironically, we have no leg to stand on if we're still feeling self-righteous, because that is the surest sign that we are still under the demon's malevolent sway. This is precisely the opposite of what that emotion tells us — that the more we feel it, the more _free_ of evil we must surely be. It is actually impossible to fight evil from this place, because self-deception can only ever create more of itself.

Our true enemy is not other people, but the dark "entity" that has captured _all_ of our minds. By keeping our attention fixated perpetually outward, it ensures that we never introspect deeply enough to discover our own complicity in keeping it alive. We _must_ learn to perceive this.

We each have a crucial role to play in bringing down the "global conspiracy," and it begins by rediscovering our Light.

MLK once said:

> *Darkness cannot drive out darkness; only light can do that. Hate cannot drive out hate; only love can do that.*

These words are far wiser than we know. Ultimately, evil is not actually a _presence_ (like it seems), but an _absence_. The absence of what? Of the perception of the interconnectedness of all Life; of our fundamental equality with others. That this absence can behave so much like a presence — and an _intelligent_ one at that — is astonishing.

In a profound and surprising sense, [you _are_ the world](unity.md). Ultimately, all self-deception boils down to ignorance of this fact. This ignorance is not fully dispelled until _enlightenment_, but we can all sense it at all times. It is why certain literature speaks to us so loudly, and why we sometimes thank strangers for acts of charity that don't seem to benefit us directly. Part of us knows that what happens to the world ultimately happens to us. It is senseless to scorn people for not having realized this.

It is not possible to reduce the darkness in the world by withholding our own Light; by leveraging our contempt[^contempt], malice, hatred, etc. That is an insidious trap that we _must_ see through if humanity is to survive. Your Light is capable of accomplishing everything you think you need your darkness for, and much, much more — but there is a price that must be paid: you must give up the illusion of being special; of being fundamentally different from the "bad people." You must relinquish the sinister pleasure of watching harm come to your enemies. In brief, you must give up self-deception.

In exchange, you will discover the path toward the world you actually want in your deepest heart of hearts. It is well worth the price, and infinitely more.

When this happens, a schism is created in your mind: part of you knows _perfectly well_ that you're doing wrong, but that knowledge is cleverly shielded from conscious self-reflection.

[//]: # (We see it easily in others, but in ourselves only when it's convenient to our self-image.)

Evil (almost) never _feels_ evil — or rather, even when it _does_ feel evil, the evil feels _right._ That's the most terrifying thing, and the hardest to describe. When I say that "evil feels right," you first imagine feeling evil — which triggers your "wrong" detector — and then think that only a "bad person" could feel this as "right." But that's not how it works. It feels _exactly_ like you do when you mock your enemies — but even _more_ obviously "good." That's because the worse a behavior is, the _harder_ your self-deception mechanism must work to cover it up. **If you cannot detect the "wrongness" in your mockery, you will not be able to detect it when you are committing atrocities, because your self-deception will have become infinitely stronger and more clever.**

I know this sounds preposterous. "Me? Committing _atrocities_? Just what do you take me for?" But the truth is that if you perceive your enemies as _evil enough_, your righteous instinct will _compel_ you to do everything in your power as a "good person" to stop them — and something within you is inexorably driving you toward seeing them as _impossibly evil._ Nobody _ever_ notices when they've "crossed the line," and it's impossibly arrogant to believe that you're special — _especially_ if you don't already (consciously) recognize what is being pointed out here.

It's not until _after_ you wake up from this self-induced trance that you discover just how badly you were fooling yourself. People were even trying to _warn_ you — but in that grotesque state, you couldn't see what they were pointing at. In fact, the harder they tried to show you, the more you perceived _them_ as evil, crazy, or stupid — which only deepened your self-deceptive trance. But most horrifically of all, you will discover that **some part of you always knew that you were doing wrong, even as you pretended not to**. By this point it is too late to make amends.

You will take this as confirmation of _their_ evil, but they are actually recognizing the same self-deceptive mechanism in you that is operating within them – the very thing you see as "evil." **This whole sordid dance was choreographed by the darkness in _both_ of your minds, to perpetuate itself without either of you catching on.** You both come away feeling more than justified.

Something within you _wants_ to push people further into the dark, but doesn't want to be caught doing so. This is malevolent. People can subconsciously sense this intention, and this by itself is enough to provoke the darkness in their minds. Mission accomplished; more darkness was created without you having to do anything provably evil. All it took was your dark motivation — something that you can trivially deny, even to yourself. It is this dark pattern that "good people" employ to maintain their self-image. _Genuinely_ good people are those who have learned to stop doing it. They _never_ look down on others, because this is the surest sign of brewing self-deception.

The reason that the "bad people" need to shield their misbehavior from consciousness is that _part of them doesn't want to be doing wrong._ This means that they are not _fundamentally_ defective. We perceive their badness as intrinsic only to justify our contempt, which in turn exists only to create more. You don't have to take my word for it, but can actually learn to perceive this. If you manage to take your own self-deception mechanism offline for even a moment, it feels exactly like you'd imagine feeling if you were suddenly freed from a demonic possession. You clearly perceive how this "demon" has very cleverly commandeered people's minds.

To be fair, there does seem to be a tiny percentage of people who have consciously welcomed the demon in, for whom the description "evil" really does capture something important. Such people pose a unique challenge. Being "kind" to them in the conventional sense can indeed be dangerous. And yet the very _deepest_ aspect of their mind does not want it. Again, it is only once you see exactly what "it" is that you understand why _nobody_ ultimately could. Think of it like a form of Stockholm syndrome. If you want to defeat evil, you must want them to be free of it, too.

When we meet (or even hear about) such people, we often experience the overwhelming urge to hate them, but this is the ultimate trap. It is their darkness inviting ours to treat them in a way that will drive them further into its clutches — and we very often take the bait. How could we not? It is like a gift-wrapped present: the opportunity to manifest our darkest tendencies in a way that we can convince ourselves and others is unmistakably _good._ 

Seeing this all clearly turns your whole world upside-down. We are hating people for their susceptibility to the world's most fiendish mind-virus — the one responsible for our very hatred. **Any time you feel contempt for _anyone_ for _any reason whatsoever_, your mind is secretly gearing up to elevate or otherwise enrich yourself at the world's expense.** We are all hypocrites, and contempt is _always_ a sign that your mind is hiding some hypocrisy from yourself.

Until this becomes _common knowledge_ (in the [technical sense](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/common-knowledge/) — where everyone knows that everyone knows that everyone knows...), humanity will continue to tie itself up in horrifying knots while pretending to be freeing itself from them. (This is exemplified by "pseudo-kind" ideologies, in which people claim to be helping one person or group by demonizing another. This *always* triggers a counter-ideology, and not by accident.) Unfortunately, our self-deception prevents us from making this _common knowledge_, no matter how clearly it is pointed out. This piece is an attempt.

What happens when your self-deception mechanism to "goes offline"? 

Your whole carefully-constructed reality — and the hierarchy of blame that scaffolds it — suddenly comes crashing down. The "great battles" that others are facing suddenly become obvious, as does your unfortunate role in having perpetuated them. It is impossible to communicate how painful the full epiphany is — to see what a hypocrite you've been; to be forcefully shown just how much of the world's darkness can be traced back to your own decisions to be unkind. But it's not all gloom and doom.

You then perceive your profound interconnectedness with the world. Malice, contempt, and self-righteousness are recognized as profoundly delusional. Seeing how confused people actually are, it is impossible to feel a trace of ill-will. You remember the sense in which you are not fundamentally better (or worse) than anyone, and why pretending that you are always makes the world darker. You feel boundless love for all of reality, recognizing your inseparability from every particle of it.

This perspective is not an altered state of consciousness, but something that is always there yet somehow curiously hidden. It feels like coming home to a place you never left. It is your deepest and most natural mode of knowing, which is how you will know that you can trust it.

There, you see that the root of the problem was the desire to be special; what the Buddhists call the _ego_. For those of us with a self-image as "good people," this manifests as the need to be _relatively_ good; i.e., good in comparison to others. This duality forces us to continually create "bad people" in all sorts of subtle ways that we can't consciously recognize. This process only comes to an end when we discover the _absolute_ good within.

This "absolute good" is something that we cannot take any credit for[^credit]. Instead, we can only feel profound gratitude for whatever grace allowed us to discover it, and heartbreak that it still remains so deeply hidden in others. The hardest part is watching the whole world being casually cruel to each other, unaware of which "team" they are secretly fighting for. It inspires a fierce determination to end the "possession" that has captured people's minds, instead of deepening it like we've unwittingly been doing. We clearly see the face of our true nemesis for the first time.

This doesn't mean that you will suddenly become nice or lovey-dovey toward evildoers. You may still need to be fierce, or perhaps even violent[^dalai-lama-gun]. Mockery, shaming, or even _apparent_ contempt might still be useful tools in your arsenal. But these will be in the service of _freeing_ people from the darkness, not pushing them further in. It is a kind of "tough love," and feels _nothing_ like the self-righteous antagonism that we normally feel when "fighting evil." You are still "connected to your heart." **That is what is most crucial.** Others can sense the profoundly benevolent intent (even if only subconsciously), and it makes _all the difference in the world_.

In every interaction you have two options: to either encourage the Light in others, or to fight their darkness with yours. **Encouraging their Light has nothing to do with being _nice_**. It is about being completely unwilling to abandon your own Light under _any circumstances_ — including the one that their darkness is presently testing you with. Their darkness is looking for a "hook" in your mind that it can use to justify itself — some sign that even you, the "good person," are weak to its seduction. If you refuse to abandon your integrity even then, the fierceness of your Light subjugates their darkness. They subconsciously remember that _the Light_ isn't just a myth.

This is authentic kindness (aka compassion). It is "radical" for two reasons. First, it contradicts our usual intuition that some people "deserve" it while others don't. It could never be the case that some people deserve to be shoved further into the abyss while others deserve to be freed from it. Second, it need not look anything like "kindness" in the conventional sense (though most often, it will). It certainly doesn't have to be soft or weak.

<p align="center" width="100%">
    <img width="300px" src="img/good-vs-bad.png"> 
</p>

I know it feels like some people don't _have_ an inner Light to encourage, but this is just an illusion that our darkness uses to get its foot in the door. By the time it has tricked us into dividing the world into fundamentally "good" and "bad" people — which feels like the most natural thing in the world — it has already infected the deepest aspect of our minds. Then, it can bide its time fostering conditions that will get us to commit unspeakable horror in the name of "good."[^genocide]

> _And no wonder, for even Satan masquerades as an angel of light._ —2 Corinthians 11:14

It is said that "the elites" are tricking us into hating each other to take attention off of themselves. Doesn't this make you hate them? Could it be that there is an even more subtle and wicked puppetmaster that is tricking us into hating _them_, so that we never discover _it_?

Indeed there is. No matter how much power the elites wield, it is _nothing_ compared to that of the dark entity pulling even their strings.

<p align="center" width="100%">
    <img width="300px" src="img/angel-devil-shoulders.png"> 
</p>

You know the classic image of the angel and devil sitting on our shoulders? It's _almost_ accurate, except for two things. First, the angel isn't external to you, but represents your intrinsically compassionate nature. Second, the devil _is_ extrinsic; it is a kind of parasite. But it doesn't just whisper obviously-bad ideas in your ear; it alters your very perception and pretends to _be_ your inner angel.

<p align="center" width="100%">
    <img width="300px" src="img/parasite.png"> 
</p>

It is this devil that tricks you into seeing other people as _fundamentally_ defective, instead of seeing that they are being manipulated by _their_ devils (which is something that your angel can always see). Our devils continually trigger each other — not because they are enemies, but _because they are allies_. Evil never actually fights evil; it only pretends to, to create more of itself.

<p align="center" width="100%">
    <img width="300px" src="img/shared-devil.png"> 
</p>

You know how people sometimes suspect that there's an "evil global conspiracy" lurking in the shadows, running the show behind the scenes? They are not crazy. They are subconsciously sensing something genuine: there is indeed an aspect of all of our minds communicating with itself beneath our conscious thresholds, shielding itself from discovery in _insanely_ clever ways. Its greatest trick is to prevent us from suspecting, let alone detecting, our own role in keeping it alive.

Our individual devils are working together almost like a single "distributed organism" — the _Devil_, if you will. Each of us suspects its existence, but we all view it from different angles. No two people fully agree on who's ultimately pulling the strings of the evil plot. The truth is that _nobody_ is — and _everybody_ is.

<p align="center" width="100%">
    <img width="300px" src="img/evil-above-world.png"> 
</p>

This "dark entity" continually drives humanity toward various kinds of Armageddon: situations in which everyone is violently expressing their own righteous fury to defeat the darkness "out there." It is why the US is headed toward civil war without anyone suspecting their own complicity, and explains bitter [divorces](https://www.gottman.com/blog/this-one-thing-is-the-biggest-predictor-of-divorce/) in which each side feels like the exclusive victim / hero. Nearly the whole world is caught in its terrible sway, evil provoking "righteous" retribution at every turn, without anyone ever noticing the true source of it all.

This is not just a wacky theory, or just a metaphor. As best I can tell, everyone who introspects carefully enough eventually discovers this. Something within your very mind is conspiring with the darkness in others to produce a kind of Hell on Earth. Every time you feel contempt for _anyone_, your "devil" is reaching out to give theirs a kind of secret handshake; a sinister agreement to keep this world bound in darkness. I have used the word "subconscious" to describe this activity, but that's not quite accurate. **It is completely accessible to consciousness, if you know how to look.** It is something you are _doing._ [The Devil hides in the last place you would ever look](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gg8JYYyWSPg); the innermost chamber of your mind.

It is impossible to overstate the shock of discovering, for the first time, that you have _always_ been in on the "evil global conspiracy." It is terrifying, heartbreaking, and humbling all at once. Every single act of unkindness we've ever perpetrated has been in the service of the Beast, even when we told ourselves that we had "good intentions." This includes not only being cruel to other people, but _all_ acts in which we skirt our conscience — such as when we "shave off a little extra" for ourselves at the expense of others, or take pleasure in others' suffering, or countless other "innocent" misbehaviors. Every time we do this, we are strengthening each other's demons.

To be clear: there are surely groups of particularly "endarkened" people who consciously conspire to cause great harm, and **we must hold such people accountable** — but when we do so with contempt, we are secretly (and on a subconscious level, _knowingly_) reinforcing the very conditions that effectively compel their existence. They cannot be defeated without our seeing this.

<p align="center" width="100%">
    <img width="300px" src="img/evil-conspiracy.png"> 
</p>

Ironically, we have no leg to stand on if we're still feeling self-righteous, because that is the surest sign that we are still under the demon's malevolent sway. This is precisely the opposite of what that emotion tells us — that the more we feel it, the more _free_ of evil we must surely be. It is actually impossible to fight evil from this place, because self-deception can only ever create more of itself.

Our true enemy is not other people, but the dark "entity" that has captured _all_ of our minds. By keeping our attention fixated perpetually outward, it ensures that we never introspect deeply enough to discover our own complicity in keeping it alive. We _must_ learn to perceive this.

We each have a crucial role to play in bringing down the "global conspiracy," and it begins by rediscovering our Light.

MLK once said:

> *Darkness cannot drive out darkness; only light can do that. Hate cannot drive out hate; only love can do that.*

These words are far wiser than we know. Ultimately, evil is not actually a _presence_ (like it seems), but an _absence_. The absence of what? Of the perception of the interconnectedness of all Life; of our fundamental equality with others. That this absence can behave so much like a presence — and an _intelligent_ one at that — is astonishing.

In a profound and surprising sense, [you _are_ the world](unity.md). Ultimately, all self-deception boils down to ignorance of this fact. This ignorance is not fully dispelled until _enlightenment_, but we can all sense it at all times. It is why certain literature speaks to us so loudly, and why we sometimes thank strangers for acts of charity that don't seem to benefit us directly. Part of us knows that what happens to the world ultimately happens to us. It is senseless to scorn people for not having realized this.

It is not possible to reduce the darkness in the world by withholding our own Light; by leveraging our contempt[^contempt], malice, hatred, etc. That is an insidious trap that we _must_ see through if humanity is to survive. Your Light is capable of accomplishing everything you think you need your darkness for, and much, much more — but there is a price that must be paid: you must give up the illusion of being special; of being fundamentally different from the "bad people." You must relinquish the sinister pleasure of watching harm come to your enemies. In brief, you must give up self-deception.

In exchange, you will discover the path toward the world you actually want in your deepest heart of hearts. It is well worth the price, and infinitely more.

Would you notice when _you_ crossed the line? You probably believe that you would, but it's not so simple. The way your devil works is by finding steps that are too small for you to waste time questioning them. And after you've taken a step, your mind always justifies it, to maintain your sanity. After taking 1000 such baby steps, somewhere you will have "crossed the line" — but the truth is that the very first step already crossed the only line that matters: the one where you went from following what you know to be right in your heart of hearts; your conscience, to following what your mind tells you is right; "justifications"; your devil. Don't ever take that first step away from your Heart. It is already evil.)


## Footnotes

[^contempt]: Specifically, we mean (genuine) contempt for *people*. Contempt for ideas or behaviors can actually be healthy, as perhaps can (apparent) contempt that is rooted in genuine compassion.

[^credit]: In fact, taking credit for it is one way to be sure that we haven't found "it."

[^dalai-lama-gun]: The Dalai Lama was once asked what you should do if a gunman is trying to shoot you and you have a gun. [He said "shoot back."](https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/dalai-gun/)

[^genocide]: This is how genocides happen. The Nazis referred to Jews as 'vermin,' and during the genocide in Rwanda, Tutsis were referred to as 'cockroaches.' This is a common pattern throughout history. Perhaps paradoxically, the only way to be sure that you'd never do such a thing is that you don't feel contempt for the people who have.

What if nearly everything you're doing to "fight evil" is actually strengthening it — and moreover, what if part of you already knows this, but is actively concealing it from your conscious mind? What if the difficulty in admitting this to yourself is caused by the _same insidious phenomenon_ that prevents the "bad people" from acknowledging the full implications of _their_ actions? What if you and they are secretly on the same team?

These are provocative questions, but they point to an astonishing truth — one that is excruciatingly painful yet ultimately liberating. The Devil hides in the very last place you would ever look.

---

Take a moment to reflect on what's wrong with the world, and bring to mind the people responsible. Don't they seem _fundamentally morally defective_? Do you feel contempt for them, or maybe even malice? It feels like those emotions are there to help you _fight_ evil, but this is a sinister lie. They exist only to help you _darken_ the world while making you feel flawlessly convinced that you're helping.

This is not something I can convince you of, so I won't even try. But here's the thing: part of you already knows it. You don't enjoy mocking or shaming your enemies to help them (or anyone else) "see the light," or to make the world a better place. You do it to make yourself feel superior. This may temporarily suppress their (public) misbehavior, but it _will_ increase the net hostility and polarization in the world. You may tell yourself that it won't, or that it's their fault if it does, or that the benefits outweigh the drawbacks, but part of you knows that these are just lame excuses for malicious behavior.

This isn't an attack on you, though it may feel like one. That defensiveness is hiding something crucial — something that I promise you want to see. An aspect of your mind is actively preventing you from consciously acknowledging the effects of your words and actions. Why? 

Part of you _knows_ that darkness exists within you, and it does everything in its power to shield this horrifying truth from your conscious mind. It makes you hyperfocus on the faults in others, because viciously attacking their evil takes attention off of your own. Said another way: something within us _needs_ other people to be "bad," so that we can know ourselves as "good" by comparison. So we subconsciously behave in ways that _provoke_ evil under the guise of righteousness.

Think back to a time when you disobeyed your conscience, pretending either that you couldn't hear it or that you could safely ignore it. We've all done this. When this happens, a schism is created in your mind: part of you knows _perfectly well_ that you're doing wrong, but that knowledge is cleverly shielded from conscious self-reflection. It is then easy to convince others that you _don't_ know, because you have convinced _yourself_. **All evil relies on this mechanism of self-deception**. 

[//]: # (We see it easily in others, but in ourselves only when it's convenient to our self-image.)

Evil (almost) never _feels_ evil — or rather, even when it _does_ feel evil, the evil feels _right._ That's the most terrifying thing, and the hardest to describe. When I say that "evil feels right," you first imagine feeling evil — which triggers your "wrong" detector — and then think that only a "bad person" could feel this as "right." But that's not how it works. It feels _exactly_ like you do when you mock your enemies — but even _more_ obviously "good." That's because the worse a behavior is, the _harder_ your self-deception mechanism must work to cover it up. **If you cannot detect the "wrongness" in your mockery, you will not be able to detect it when you are committing atrocities, because your self-deception will have become infinitely stronger and more clever.**

I know this sounds preposterous. "Me? Committing _atrocities_? Just what do you take me for?" But the truth is that if you perceive your enemies as _evil enough_, your righteous instinct will _compel_ you to do everything in your power as a "good person" to stop them — and something within you is inexorably driving you toward seeing them as _impossibly evil._ Nobody _ever_ notices when they've "crossed the line," and it's impossibly arrogant to believe that you're special — _especially_ if you don't already (consciously) recognize what is being pointed out here.

It's not until _after_ you wake up from this self-induced trance that you discover just how badly you were fooling yourself. People were even trying to _warn_ you — but in that grotesque state, you couldn't see what they were pointing at. In fact, the harder they tried to show you, the more you perceived _them_ as evil, crazy, or stupid — which only deepened your self-deceptive trance. But most horrifically of all, you will discover that **some part of you always knew that you were doing wrong, even as you pretended not to**. By this point it is too late to make amends.

This is where the "bad people" find themselves. Something in them is shielding the _wrongness_ of their behavior from conscious self-reflection — and the more contemptuously you judge them for it, the more they will perceive _you_ as evil and dig in their heels. You will take this as confirmation of _their_ evil, but they are actually recognizing the same self-deceptive mechanism in you that is operating within them – the very thing you see as "evil." **This whole sordid dance was choreographed by the darkness in _both_ of your minds, to perpetuate itself without either of you catching on.** You both come away feeling more than justified.

Something within you _wants_ to push people further into the dark, but doesn't want to be caught doing so. This is malevolent. People can subconsciously sense this intention, and this by itself is enough to provoke the darkness in their minds. Mission accomplished; more darkness was created without you having to do anything provably evil. All it took was your dark motivation — something that you can trivially deny, even to yourself. It is this dark pattern that "good people" employ to maintain their self-image. _Genuinely_ good people are those who have learned to stop doing it. They _never_ look down on others, because this is the surest sign of brewing self-deception.

The reason that the "bad people" need to shield their misbehavior from consciousness is that _part of them doesn't want to be doing wrong._ This means that they are not _fundamentally_ defective. We perceive their badness as intrinsic only to justify our contempt, which in turn exists only to create more. You don't have to take my word for it, but can actually learn to perceive this. If you manage to take your own self-deception mechanism offline for even a moment, it feels exactly like you'd imagine feeling if you were suddenly freed from a demonic possession. You clearly perceive how this "demon" has very cleverly commandeered people's minds.

To be fair, there does seem to be a tiny percentage of people who have consciously welcomed the demon in, for whom the description "evil" really does capture something important.

Again, it is only once you see exactly what "it" is that you understand why _nobody_ ultimately could. Think of it like a form of Stockholm syndrome. If you want to defeat evil, you must want them to be free of it, too.

When we meet (or even hear about) such people, we often experience the overwhelming urge to hate them, but this is the ultimate trap. It is their darkness inviting ours to treat them in a way that will drive them further into its clutches — and we very often take the bait. How could we not? It is like a gift-wrapped present: the opportunity to manifest our darkest tendencies in a way that we can convince ourselves and others is unmistakably _good._ 

Seeing this all clearly turns your whole world upside-down. We are hating people for their susceptibility to the world's most fiendish mind-virus — the one responsible for our very hatred. **Any time you feel contempt for _anyone_ for _any reason whatsoever_, your mind is secretly gearing up to elevate or otherwise enrich yourself at the world's expense.** We are all hypocrites, and contempt is _always_ a sign that your mind is hiding some hypocrisy from yourself.

Until this becomes _common knowledge_ (in the [technical sense](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/common-knowledge/) — where everyone knows that everyone knows that everyone knows...), humanity will continue to tie itself up in horrifying knots while pretending to be freeing itself from them. (This is exemplified by "pseudo-kind" ideologies, in which people claim to be helping one person or group by demonizing another. This *always* triggers a counter-ideology, and not by accident.) Unfortunately, our self-deception prevents us from making this _common knowledge_, no matter how clearly it is pointed out. This piece is an attempt.

What happens when your self-deception mechanism to "goes offline"? 

Your whole carefully-constructed reality — and the hierarchy of blame that scaffolds it — suddenly comes crashing down. The "great battles" that others are facing suddenly become obvious, as does your unfortunate role in having perpetuated them. It is impossible to communicate how painful the full epiphany is — to see what a hypocrite you've been; to be forcefully shown just how much of the world's darkness can be traced back to your own decisions to be unkind. But it's not all gloom and doom.

You then perceive your profound interconnectedness with the world. Malice, contempt, and self-righteousness are recognized as profoundly delusional. Seeing how confused people actually are, it is impossible to feel a trace of ill-will. You remember the sense in which you are not fundamentally better (or worse) than anyone, and why pretending that you are always makes the world darker. You feel boundless love for all of reality, recognizing your inseparability from every particle of it.

This perspective is not an altered state of consciousness, but something that is always there yet somehow curiously hidden. It feels like coming home to a place you never left. It is your deepest and most natural mode of knowing, which is how you will know that you can trust it.

There, you see that the root of the problem was the desire to be special; what the Buddhists call the _ego_. For those of us with a self-image as "good people," this manifests as the need to be _relatively_ good; i.e., good in comparison to others. This duality forces us to continually create "bad people" in all sorts of subtle ways that we can't consciously recognize. This process only comes to an end when we discover the _absolute_ good within.

This "absolute good" is something that we cannot take any credit for[^credit]. Instead, we can only feel profound gratitude for whatever grace allowed us to discover it, and heartbreak that it still remains so deeply hidden in others. The hardest part is watching the whole world being casually cruel to each other, unaware of which "team" they are secretly fighting for. It inspires a fierce determination to end the "possession" that has captured people's minds, instead of deepening it like we've unwittingly been doing. We clearly see the face of our true nemesis for the first time.

This doesn't mean that you will suddenly become nice or lovey-dovey toward evildoers. You may still need to be fierce, or perhaps even violent[^dalai-lama-gun]. Mockery, shaming, or even _apparent_ contempt might still be useful tools in your arsenal. But these will be in the service of _freeing_ people from the darkness, not pushing them further in. It is a kind of "tough love," and feels _nothing_ like the self-righteous antagonism that we normally feel when "fighting evil."

It is about being completely unwilling to abandon your own Light under _any circumstances_ — including the one that their darkness is presently testing you with. Their darkness is looking for a "hook" in your mind that it can use to justify itself — some sign that even you, the "good person," are weak to its seduction. If you refuse to abandon your integrity even then, the fierceness of your Light subjugates their darkness. They subconsciously remember that _the Light_ isn't just a myth.

This is authentic kindness (aka compassion). It is "radical" for two reasons. First, it contradicts our usual intuition that some people "deserve" it while others don't. It could never be the case that some people deserve to be shoved further into the abyss while others deserve to be freed from it. Second, it need not look anything like "kindness" in the conventional sense (though most often, it will). It certainly doesn't have to be soft or weak.

It is actually impossible to fight evil from this place, because self-deception can only ever create more of itself.

Our true enemy is not other people, but the dark "entity" that has captured _all_ of our minds. By keeping our attention fixated perpetually outward, it ensures that we never introspect deeply enough to discover our own complicity in keeping it alive. We _must_ learn to perceive this.

We each have a crucial role to play in bringing down the "global conspiracy," and it begins by rediscovering our Light.

MLK once said:

> *Darkness cannot drive out darkness; only light can do that. Hate cannot drive out hate; only love can do that.*

These words are far wiser than we know. Ultimately, evil is not actually a _presence_ (like it seems), but an _absence_. The absence of what? Of the perception of the interconnectedness of all Life; of our fundamental equality with others. That this absence can behave so much like a presence — and an _intelligent_ one at that — is astonishing.

In a profound and surprising sense, [you _are_ the world](unity.md). Ultimately, all self-deception boils down to ignorance of this fact. This ignorance is not fully dispelled until _enlightenment_, but we can all sense it at all times. It is why certain literature speaks to us so loudly, and why we sometimes thank strangers for acts of charity that don't seem to benefit us directly. Part of us knows that what happens to the world ultimately happens to us. It is senseless to scorn people for not having realized this.

It is not possible to reduce the darkness in the world by withholding our own Light; by leveraging our contempt[^contempt], malice, hatred, etc. That is an insidious trap that we _must_ see through if humanity is to survive. Your Light is capable of accomplishing everything you think you need your darkness for, and much, much more — but there is a price that must be paid: you must give up the illusion of being special; of being fundamentally different from the "bad people." You must relinquish the sinister pleasure of watching harm come to your enemies. In brief, you must give up self-deception.

In exchange, you will discover the path toward the world you actually want in your deepest heart of hearts. It is well worth the price, and infinitely more.

## Addendum

(TODO)

- Compassion doesn't mean you know what the most beneficial behavior _is_; it merely ensures that you are not falling into the many seductive traps of your darkness. Determining the most effective behavior requires _wisdom_, which is a vast topic, and beyond the scope of this work. Compassion may be no easier to acquire than wisdom, but it is much simpler: there is a single place within your mind that you can turn to and _know_ whether you are allying with the darkness or the Light.


- "Outrage" can mean (healthy) anger directed at correcting an injustice, but it quickly gets corrupted into self-righteous indignation. Similarly, "judgement" can refer to wise discernment, but it quickly devolves into disdain. Just like "compassion" doesn't really mean "being nice," these words get redefined by our evil so that we make a mess of what is actually quite simple.

Would you notice when _you_ crossed the line? You probably believe that you would, but it's not so simple. The way your devil works is by finding steps that are too small for you to waste time questioning them. And after you've taken a step, your mind always justifies it, to maintain your sanity. After taking 1000 such baby steps, somewhere you will have "crossed the line" — but the truth is that the very first step already crossed the only line that matters: the one where you went from following what you know to be right in your heart of hearts; your conscience, to following what your mind tells you is right; "justifications"; your devil. Don't ever take that first step away from your Heart. It is already evil.)


## Footnotes

[^contempt]: Specifically, we mean (genuine) contempt for *people*. Contempt for ideas or behaviors can actually be healthy, as perhaps can (apparent) contempt that is rooted in genuine compassion.

[^credit]: In fact, taking credit for it is one way to be sure that we haven't found "it."

[^dalai-lama-gun]: The Dalai Lama was once asked what you should do if a gunman is trying to shoot you and you have a gun. [He said "shoot back."](https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/dalai-gun/)

[^genocide]: This is how genocides happen. The Nazis referred to Jews as 'vermin,' and during the genocide in Rwanda, Tutsis were referred to as 'cockroaches.' This is a common pattern throughout history. Perhaps paradoxically, the only way to be sure that you'd never do such a thing is that you don't feel contempt for the people who have.

What if nearly everything you're doing to "fight evil" is actually strengthening it — and moreover, what if part of you already knows this but is actively concealing it from your conscious mind? 

There's an insidious mechanism within our minds that prevents us from consciously confronting the full implications of our behavior. It is only once we see this that we begin to understand the secret mechanism behind _all_ evil. Until then, we have no hope of defeating it. We can only amplify it.

The Devil hides in the very last place you would ever look.

Take a moment to reflect on what's wrong with the world, and bring to mind the people responsible. Don't they seem not only morally defective, but somehow _fundamentally_ so? Do you feel contempt for them, or maybe even malice? Such people cannot be fixed; they can only be subdued or punished. It feels like the contempt is there to help us accomplish those goals and thereby improve the world, but this is a sinister lie. It exists only to shield you from something your subconscious is secretly doing: preparing to justify behaviors that will elevate or otherwise enrich you at the world's expense — and make you feel _righteous_ about it.

This is not something I can convince you of, so I won't even try. But here's the thing: part of you already knows it. You don't enjoy mocking or shaming your enemies to help them (or anyone else) "see the light," or to make the world a better place. You do it to make yourself feel superior. It may temporarily suppress their misbehavior (in public, anyway), but it _will_ increase the net hostility and polarization in the world. You may tell yourself that it won't, or that it's their fault if it does, or that the benefits outweigh the drawbacks, but part of you knows that these are just lame excuses for malicious behavior.

To be clear, it's not that shame and mockery can't be helpful. They probably can — but when they're motivated by contempt, a deep part of us isn't actually _trying_ to help. It has a much darker goal in mind, and is actively shielding you from consciously recognizing this. Why?

A deep aspect of our minds _needs_ to see ourselves as special. For some people this may be about accumulating wealth, and in others it is about being "good people." This aspect makes us perceive other people in whatever way necessary to justify behavior that will bolster our self-image. For "good people," our subconscious is on the prowl for anyone we can plausibly see as "bad," and who we can then _make worse_ — but only via behaviors that appear righteous on the surface.

Of course, you will not (consciously) recognize that you're doing this — but other people can. If they are compassionate and wise, they will sense whatever "great battle" you are internally fighting that is driving this misbehavior, and will help heal it. If they are especially skilled, you won't even know that they're doing this. Their behavior may appear fierce and antagonistic, and look nothing like "compassion" — but you will subconsciously sense that they are not truly enemies.

If they are _not_ compassionate — which is to say, if they are not yet aware of the same dark tendency in themselves that they are violently accusing you of — then they will treat you with contempt. Far from helping you recognize your misbehavior, this will force your subconscious to mask it even harder. This is exactly what their darkness wants: to make you a slightly worse person, so that their contempt is validated, and their realm of "justified behaviors" grows.

---

Your _conscience_ (not to be confused with your _consciousness_) is that part of you that most deeply knows right from wrong. It doesn't always give you such a clear signal, but even when it does, you can choose to override it. We've all done this. These are the justifications we use to convince ourselves that certain behaviors are okay even when we deep down know they're not.

The more we disobey our conscience, the harder it becomes to hear. Its signal very quickly becomes lost in the noise of our minds, and we easily confuse our justifications for its voice. It's not that it has become _quieter_, per se. It is always right there, if we bother to look. But we train ourselves _not_ to look — again, because there is some competing drive that is competing for priority. 

Everyone lies somewhere along this spectrum of self-deception. We like to think that the people who are further along than we are are somehow fundamentally morally inferior to us — and therefore worthy of our contempt — but this is exactly the lie. We believe this _only_ so that we can feel good about pushing them further in, thereby increasing our apparent intrinsic difference.

It is true that they've for some reason _chosen_ to ignore their conscience — and therefore need to be corrected — but it's _also_ true that some tiny part of them doesn't want to be doing this. The choice you face in confronting them is to do the hard work of finding that "tiny" part of them and helping it join the fight against their darkness, or to take the easy route and push it further into the abyss for your own glorification. For the most part, humanity has been going full-throttle on the second approach.

As a civilization, we are _pretending_ to be fighting evil, but part of our minds knows that this is just a ruse for secret self-aggrandizement. Nothing will change until we become deeply aware of this.

If you manage to take your own self-deception mechanism offline for even a moment, it feels exactly like you'd imagine feeling if you were suddenly freed from a demonic possession. You clearly perceive how this "demon" has very cleverly commandeered people's minds.

Seeing this all clearly turns your whole world upside-down. We are hating people for their susceptibility to the world's most fiendish mind-virus — the one responsible for our very hatred. **Any time you feel contempt for _anyone_ for _any reason whatsoever_, your mind is secretly gearing up to elevate or otherwise enrich yourself at the world's expense.** We are all hypocrites, and contempt is _always_ a sign that your mind is hiding some hypocrisy from yourself.

Until this becomes _common knowledge_ (in the [technical sense](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/common-knowledge/) — where everyone knows that everyone knows that everyone knows...), humanity will continue to tie itself up in horrifying knots while pretending to be freeing itself from them. (This is exemplified by "pseudo-kind" ideologies, in which people claim to be helping one person or group by demonizing another. I'm sure you can think of examples.) Unfortunately, our self-deception prevents us from making this _common knowledge_, no matter how clearly it is pointed out. This piece is an attempt.

---

What happens when your self-deception mechanism to "goes offline"? 

Your whole carefully-constructed reality — and the hierarchy of blame that scaffolds it — suddenly comes crashing down. The "great battles" that others are facing suddenly become obvious, as does your unfortunate role in having perpetuated them. It is impossible to communicate how painful the full epiphany is — to see what a hypocrite you've been; to be forcefully shown just how much of the world's darkness can be traced back to your own decisions to be unkind. But it's not all gloom and doom.

You then perceive your profound interconnectedness with the world. Malice, contempt, and self-righteousness are recognized as profoundly delusional. Seeing how confused people actually are, it is impossible to feel a trace of ill-will. You remember the sense in which you are not fundamentally better (or worse) than anyone, and why pretending that you are always makes the world darker. You feel boundless love for all of reality, recognizing your inseparability from every particle of it.

This perspective is not an altered state of consciousness, but something that is always there yet somehow curiously hidden. It feels like coming home to a place you never left. It is your deepest and most natural mode of knowing, which is how you will know that you can trust it.

There, you see that the root of the problem was the desire to be special; what the Buddhists call the _ego_. For those of us with a self-image as "good people," this manifests as the need to be _relatively_ good; i.e., good in comparison to others. This duality forces us to continually create "bad people" in all sorts of subtle ways that we can't consciously recognize. This process only comes to an end when we discover the _absolute_ good within.

This "absolute good" is something that we cannot take any credit for[^credit]. Instead, we can only feel profound gratitude for whatever grace allowed us to discover it, and heartbreak that it still remains so deeply hidden in others. The hardest part is watching the whole world being casually cruel to each other, unaware of which "team" they are secretly fighting for. It inspires a fierce determination to end the "possession" that has captured people's minds, instead of deepening it like we've unwittingly been doing. We clearly see the face of our true nemesis for the first time.

This doesn't mean that you will suddenly become nice or lovey-dovey toward evildoers. You may still need to be fierce, or perhaps even violent[^dalai-lama-gun]. Mockery, shaming, or even _apparent_ contempt might still be useful tools in your arsenal. But these will be in the service of _freeing_ people from the darkness, not pushing them further in. It is a kind of "tough love," and feels _nothing_ like the self-righteous antagonism that we normally feel when "fighting evil." You are still "connected to your heart." **That is what is most crucial.** Others can sense the profoundly benevolent intent (even if only subconsciously), and it makes _all the difference in the world_.

In every interaction you have two options: to either encourage the Light in others, or to fight their darkness with yours. **Encouraging their Light has nothing to do with being _nice_**. It is about being completely unwilling to abandon your own Light under _any circumstances_ — including the one that their darkness is presently testing you with. Their darkness is looking for a "hook" in your mind that it can use to justify itself — some sign that even you, the "good person," are weak to its seduction. If you refuse to abandon your integrity even then, the fierceness of your Light subjugates their darkness. They subconsciously remember that _the Light_ isn't just a myth.

This is authentic kindness (aka compassion). It is "radical" for two reasons. First, it contradicts our usual intuition that some people "deserve" it while others don't. It could never be the case that some people deserve to be shoved further into the abyss while others deserve to be freed from it.

Our true enemy is not other people, but the dark "entity" that has captured _all_ of our minds. By keeping our attention fixated perpetually outward, it ensures that we never introspect deeply enough to discover our own complicity in keeping it alive. We _must_ learn to perceive this.

We each have a crucial role to play in bringing down the "global conspiracy," and it begins by rediscovering our Light.

MLK once said:

> *Darkness cannot drive out darkness; only light can do that. Hate cannot drive out hate; only love can do that.*

These words are far wiser than we know. Ultimately, evil is not actually a _presence_ (like it seems), but an _absence_. The absence of what? Of the perception of the interconnectedness of all Life; of our fundamental equality with others. That this absence can behave so much like a presence — and an _intelligent_ one at that — is astonishing.

In a profound and surprising sense, [you _are_ the world](unity.md). Ultimately, all self-deception boils down to ignorance of this fact. This ignorance is not fully dispelled until _enlightenment_, but we can all sense it at all times. It is why certain literature speaks to us so loudly, and why we sometimes thank strangers for acts of charity that don't seem to benefit us directly. Part of us knows that what happens to the world ultimately happens to us. It is senseless to scorn people for not having realized this.

It is not possible to reduce the darkness in the world by withholding our own Light; by leveraging our contempt[^contempt], malice, hatred, etc. That is an insidious trap that we _must_ see through if humanity is to survive. Your Light is capable of accomplishing everything you think you need your darkness for, and much, much more — but there is a price that must be paid: you must give up the illusion of being special; of being fundamentally different from the "bad people." You must relinquish the sinister pleasure of watching harm come to your enemies. In brief, you must give up self-deception.

In exchange, you will discover the path toward the world you actually want in your deepest heart of hearts. It is well worth the price, and infinitely more.

## Addendum

(TODO)

- Compassion doesn't mean you know what the most beneficial behavior _is_; it merely ensures that you are not falling into the many seductive traps of your darkness. Determining the most effective behavior requires _wisdom_, which is a vast topic, and beyond the scope of this work. Compassion may be no easier to acquire than wisdom, but it is much simpler: there is a single place within your mind that you can turn to and _know_ whether you are allying with the darkness or the Light.


- "Outrage" can mean (healthy) anger directed at correcting an injustice, but it quickly gets corrupted into self-righteous indignation. Similarly, "judgement" can refer to wise discernment, but it quickly devolves into disdain. Just like "compassion" doesn't really mean "being nice," these words get redefined by our evil so that we make a mess of what is actually quite simple.

[//]: # (We _want_ people to believe that they're fundamentally broken.)

[//]: # (The most important thing needed in making a better world is freeing people from self-deception. We think that the greatest challenge is differences in opinions, but that's not true.)

[//]: # (Reveals empathy.)

[//]: # (How do people become evil? Do they just wake up one day and choose evil? Or do they slowly slide into it, not noticing when they've crossed the line? Would you notice when _you_ crossed the line? You probably believe that you would, but it's not so simple. The way your devil works is by finding steps that are too small for you to waste time questioning them. And after you've taken a step, your mind always justifies it, to maintain your sanity. After taking 1000 such baby steps, somewhere you will have "crossed the line" — but the truth is that the very first step already crossed the only line that matters: the one where you went from following what you know to be right in your heart of hearts; your conscience, to following what your mind tells you is right; "justifications"; your devil. Don't ever take that first step away from your Heart. It is already evil.)


## Footnotes

[^contempt]: Specifically, we mean (genuine) contempt for *people*. Contempt for ideas or behaviors can actually be healthy, as perhaps can (apparent) contempt that is rooted in genuine compassion.

[^credit]: In fact, taking credit for it is one way to be sure that we haven't found "it."

[^dalai-lama-gun]: The Dalai Lama was once asked what you should do if a gunman is trying to shoot you and you have a gun. [He said "shoot back."](https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/dalai-gun/)

[^genocide]: This is how genocides happen. The Nazis referred to Jews as 'vermin,' and during the genocide in Rwanda, Tutsis were referred to as 'cockroaches.' This is a common pattern throughout history. Perhaps paradoxically, the only way to be sure that you'd never do such a thing is that you don't feel contempt for the people who have.



[//]: # (The "bad people" know perfectly well that what they're doing is wrong, but that "wrongness" is very cleverly shielded from conscious self-reflection. Any "good" person should want to be _free_ them of this deception, not to compound it — and being free of self-deception themselves, they would perceive that contempt is the wrong way to go about this.)

[//]: # (Think back to a time when you disobeyed your conscience, pretending either that you couldn't hear it or that you could safely ignore it. We've all done this. When this happens, a schism is created in your mind: part of you knows _perfectly well_ that you're doing wrong, but that knowledge is cleverly shielded from conscious self-reflection. It is then easy to convince others that you _don't_ know, because you have convinced _yourself_. **All evil relies on this mechanism of self-deception**. We notice it easily in others, but in ourselves only when it's convenient to our self-image.)

[//]: # (This is what is happening in the "bad people.")

[//]: # (Evil never _feels_ evil — or rather, even when it _does_ feel evil, that evil feels _right._ That's the most terrifying thing, and the hardest to describe. The worse a behavior is, the _harder_ your self-deception will work to cover up the "wrongness." The greatest evils feel exactly like how you feel when mocking your enemies, but a thousand times more righteous. **If you cannot detect the "wrongness" in your mockery now, you will not be able to detect it when committing atrocities.** You may believe that your morals will alert you when you're crossing the line, but this is the greatest lie: you aren't currently listening to the part of you that actually knows right from wrong; you are listening to your _justifications_ — and every time you do, they grow more seductive.)

[//]: # (It's not until _after_ you wake up from this self-induced trance that you discover just how badly you were fooling yourself. People were even trying to _warn_ you — but in that grotesque state, you couldn't see what they were pointing at. In fact, the harder they tried, the more you perceived _them_ as evil, crazy, or stupid — which only deepened your self-deceptive trance. But most horrifically of all, you will discover that **some part of you always knew that you were doing wrong, even as you pretended not to**. By this point it is too late to make amends.)

[//]: # (Something within you _wants_ to push people further into the dark, but doesn't want to be caught doing so. This is malevolent. People can subconsciously sense this intention, and this by itself is enough to provoke the darkness in their minds. Mission accomplished; more darkness was created without you having to do anything provably evil. All it took was your dark motivation — something that you can trivially deny, even to yourself. It is this dark pattern that "good people" employ to maintain their self-image. _Genuinely_ good people don't behave that way. They _never_ look down on others, because this is the surest sign of self-deception.)

[//]: # (To be fair, there does seem to be a tiny percentage of people who have consciously welcomed the demon in, for whom the description "evil" really does capture something important. Such people pose a unique challenge. Being "kind" to them in the conventional sense can indeed be dangerous. And yet the very _deepest_ aspect of their mind does not want it. Again, it is only once you see exactly what "it" is that you understand why _nobody_ ultimately could. Think of it like a form of Stockholm syndrome. If you want to defeat evil, you must want them to be free of it, too.)

[//]: # (When we meet &#40;or even hear about&#41; such people, we often experience the overwhelming urge to hate them, but this is the ultimate trap. It is their darkness inviting ours to treat them in a way that will drive them further into its clutches — and we very often take the bait. How could we not? It is like a gift-wrapped present: the opportunity to manifest our darkest tendencies in a way that we can convince ourselves and others is unmistakably _good._ )

Why is it so hard to maintain our humanity in the face of evil? And why are we "supposed to" in the first place?

---

All misbehavior — from cutting in line to genuine atrocities — is ultimately enabled by a kind of parasite in the mind. Think of it as that devil on our shoulders. It doesn't just whisper obviously-evil ideas in our ears; no, it alters our very perception, so that it appears okay (or even _righteous_) to step on certain people. It shields us from confronting the full implications of our words and behaviors.

The "bad people" know perfectly well when what they are doing is wrong, but that knowledge is very cleverly hidden from conscious self-reflection. If you try to viciously force them to confront it, it just drives the parasite deeper into their minds. But something in you already knows this.

When _you_ are in a state of self-deception — and we've all been there — you do not tolerate contempt from others. It makes you see them as _bad people_ who need to be put in _their_ place. It helps justify your self-deception — and makes you respond in a way that helps them justify theirs. This isn't an accident.

Our parasites are _collaborating_ — and contempt is the secret tool they use to communicate, beneath our conscious thresholds. Our contempt telegraphs to others that our mind is in that dark space, subconsciously plotting to elevate or otherwise enrich ourselves at the world's expense — and it invites them to do the same, whether they are nominally friends or enemies.

We treat the "bad people" with contempt to help ourselves feel superior; to further distance ourselves and prove that we're nothing alike. Unfortunately, it is the surest sign that we _are._ We are shoving people deeper into the abyss and calling it "righteous." Rather than admit it, our minds hide this horrible truth by doubling down on our self-deception, so that we never suspect it.

We maintain a dividing line between the "fundamentally" good and bad; those who deserve our compassion and those who deserve our contempt. That boundary sometimes grows, as when we first discover that "hurt people hurt people." But the maintenance of _any division at all_ indicates that our "devil" still has its foot in the door. The line exists only to justify its continued presence.

<p align="center" width="100%">
    <img width="300px" src="img/shared-devil.png"> 
</p>

If you look carefully enough, you will discover that our devils together behave more like a single malevolent distributed entity — the _Devil_, if you will. It is that archetypal "evil conspiracy" that we subconsciously fear exists — the one to which all the rest ultimately owe their existence, and to which they all ultimately report — _and every one of us is secretly in on it_. It remains hidden by keeping our attention fixated perpetually outward, blinding us to our own complicity.

Every time we feel malice, contempt, or self-righteousness; any time we are unkind to anyone for any reason, we are secretly feeding the Beast. Every act of unkindness ripples through its terrible body, lowering the threshold for more acts of evil to erupt in faraway locations — for which we will feel absolutely no complicity. But part of us always knows. This is what we must make conscious.

To be clear: there are surely groups of particularly "endarkened" people who consciously conspire to cause great harm, and **we must hold such people accountable**. But when it is motivated by contempt, we are reinforcing the very conditions that effectively _compel_ their existence — and a deep part of us knows this. It is as though the left hand does not know what the right is doing.

Nobody ultimately _wants_ to be under the sway of their devil — the key word being "ultimately." There are certainly people who willingly harbor it; those whom we classically think of as "evil." It would be foolish to be "kind" to them in the _conventional_ sense. Yet it is far _more_ foolish to feel malice, because that is **exactly** what their demon wants — and it is also where it is hardest to detect our own self-deception, and the easiest to justify it to others. It is the ultimate trap.

The more you unearth your own demon, the more clearly you see that such people are suffering from a kind of Stockholm syndrome — and the more obvious it becomes that  driving them toward their captor is malevolent. You are smothering what little light is left. It is literally the _worst_ time to be unkind. Unconventional means may be necessary to deal with them, but unkindness never is. If you believe that they _have_ no light, consider that this may be exactly the "trap" I described.

**True kindness is not about being _nice._** It can be fierce or even [violent](https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/dalai-gun/) if necessary. It is only about being lucidly aware of your own capacity to fall into self-deception, and refusing to do so. It is about staying connected to your Heart; that part of you that remembers the Truth — the very thing that your parasite is trying to make you forget. **Your fight is with the parasite. Hating the host just strengthens it.** Only your Light can bring about the better world you most deeply desire. The more you remember this, the more your very being helps others remember.

Your true nemesis is never other people, despite obvious appearances to the contrary. It is the darkness that has ensnared all of our minds.

We each have a role to play, and it always begins with us.

The further you can push them into its grip, the more they will appear to be _fundamentally defective_, and thus unlike you.

This actually creates _new_ evil, but it doesn't feel like that. It feels like we are zeroing in on existing evil; exposing or distilling the hidden evil that is already there. It is as though we have finally caught a hold of the source of darkness in the world, and we can finally _punish_ it.

> _And no wonder, for even Satan masquerades as an angel of light. So it is not strange that his ministers also masquerade as ministers of righteousness._ —2 Corinthians 11:14-16
 
This is a smokescreen created by your devil. It knows perfectly well that this will bring more darkness. In fact, that is its whole game. But it must never let you know this, and so it hides this behind _astonishingly_ seductive justifications that you don't even realize are seductions. All you consciously feel is "I'm fighting evil," and you have all the evidence to prove it.

Under the covers, their devil reached out to yours to offer it a secret handshake — and contempt was sign of your acceptance. No matter how well we try to mask this, people can subconsciously sense it. It invites everyone — ally and enemy alike — into that dark space of mind with us. What goes on in there isn't pretty.

So far I have been calling this all "subconscious," but that's not entirely accurate.

This allows us to feel superior, in a way that can plausibly be defended as righteous. We are only _fighting evil,_ after all.

We maintain a dividing line between the "fundamentally" good and bad; those who deserve our compassion and those who deserve our contempt. That boundary changes throughout life, as we develop increasing empathy. But the maintenance of _any division at all_ indicates that our "devil" still has its foot in the door. The line exists only to justify its continued presence.

The short answer to "why show evildoers compassion?" is that the only alternative is to be evil.

All misbehavior — from cutting in line to genuine atrocities — is ultimately enabled by a kind of parasite in the mind. Think of it as that devil on our shoulders. But this devil doesn't just whisper obviously-evil ideas in our ears; no, it alters our very perception, so that it appears okay — or even _righteous_ — to step on certain people. It shields us from confronting the full implications of our words and behaviors.

The "bad people" know perfectly well when what they are doing is wrong, but that knowledge is very cleverly hidden from conscious self-reflection. If you try to viciously force them to confront it, it just drives the parasite deeper into their minds. But something in you already knows this.

When _you_ are in a state of self-deception — and we've all been there — you do not tolerate contemptuous judgement from others. Why? Because it signals to you that _they_ are in a state of self-deception and are in no position to be judging you. You see them as _bad people_ who need to be put in _their_ place, and feel _even more_ licensed to do whatever you need to do — which in turn convinces them that they were right about you all along. It is the contempt that drives this outcome, not the mere judgement (in the sense of _wise discernment_).

The same is true when the positions are reversed. Self-righteous outrage feels damn good — i.e., both enjoyable and virtuous — and yet something in you knows that it will just make them dig in their heels. In fact, that part of you _wants_ this, because it helps you prove just how _bad_ they are; how totally unlike you. But there's one small problem.

Subconsciously, you can perceive that they are actually in the grip of a terrible demon that you yourself share — indeed, one that is controlling your mind _at this very moment_ — and this similarity horrifies you. You shove them deeper into the abyss to hide this fact from yourself — because the deeper they go, the easier it gets to perceive them as _fundamentally_ defective, and not as a fellow human who badly needs help. (Indeed, beyond a certain point, even _they_ cannot consciously perceive this of themselves. At that point, who can really blame us?)

This actually creates _new_ evil, but it doesn't feel like that. It feels like you are zeroing in on existing evil; exposing or distilling the hidden evil that is already there. It is as though you are finally catching a hold of the source of darkness in the world, and are finally _punishing_ it.

But it must never let you know this, and so it hides this behind _astonishingly_ seductive justifications that you don't even realize are seductions. All you consciously feel is "I'm fighting evil" — and you have all the evidence to prove it.

What "actually" happened was that under the covers, their devil reached out to yours to offer it a secret handshake — and you signaled agreement by generating contempt. _Contempt is the secret tool by which our devils coordinate, beneath our conscious thresholds._ No matter how carefully you disguise it — even from yourself — it always leaks out into the world.

If you look carefully, you will discover that our devils together behave more like a single malevolent distributed entity — the _Devil_, if you will. It is that archetypal "evil conspiracy" that we subconsciously fear exists — the one to which all the rest ultimately owe their existence, and to which they all ultimately report — _and every one of us is secretly in on it_. It remains hidden by keeping our attention fixated perpetually outward, blinding us to our own participation.

Every time we feel malice, contempt, or self-righteousness; any time we are unkind to anyone for any reason, we are secretly feeding the Beast. Every act of unkindness ripples through its terrible body, lowering the threshold for more acts of evil to erupt in faraway locations — for which we will feel absolutely no complicity. But part of us always knows.

To be clear, we're certainly not all equally complicit. There are surely groups of particularly "endarkened" people who consciously conspire to cause great harm, and **we must hold such people accountable**. But when we do so with contempt, we are reinforcing the very conditions that effectively _compel_ their existence — and a deep part of us knows this.

So far I have been calling this all "subconscious," but that's not entirely accurate. The greatest shock is discovering that it was somehow _always_ accessible to consciousness, if we'd just bothered to look. This isn't a judgement of us. We _want_ to look, but something keeps stopping us. Our duty is to discover whatever that is, and heal it.

Nobody ultimately _wants_ to be under the sway of their devil — the key word being "ultimately." There are certainly people who willingly harbor it; those whom we classically think of as "evil." It would be foolish to be "kind" to them in the _conventional_ sense. Yet it is far _more_ foolish to feel malice, because that is **exactly** what their demon wants — and it is also where it is hardest to detect our own self-deception, and the easiest to justify it to others. It is the ultimate trap.

The more you unearth your own demon, the more clearly you see that such people are suffering from a kind of Stockholm syndrome — and the more acutely you feel the malevolence of driving them toward their captor. It smothers what little light is left. (If you believe that they _have_ no light, consider that this may be exactly the "trap" I just described.) It is literally the _worst_ time to be unkind. Unconventional means may be necessary to deal with them, but unkindness never is. This could only be true if "kindness" does not mean what we usually think.

**True kindness is not about being _nice._** It can be fierce or even [violent](https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/dalai-gun/) if necessary. It only requires being lucidly aware of your own capacity for self-deception, and refusing to fall into it. It is about staying connected to your Heart; that part of you that remembers the Truth — the very thing that your parasite is lulling you into forgetting. **Your fight is with the parasite. Hating the host just strengthens it.** 

The more you remember this, the more your very way of being inspires others to remember. Then, bit by bit you notice that even "evil" has no fundamental essence; that it is not a thing that can be "fought." It is not a _presence_, but an _absence._ An absence of what? Of the perception of our deep interconnectedness and fundamental equality. Hating people for not yet perceiving this makes no sense. Only your Light can bring about the better world you most deeply desire — and only you know what form your Light must take to make that happen.

Our true nemesis is never other people, despite obvious appearance to the contrary. It is the delusion that has ensnared all of our minds.

We each have a role to play, and it always begins with us.

This allows us to feel superior, in a way that can plausibly be defended as righteous. We are only _fighting evil,_ after all.

We maintain a dividing line between the "fundamentally" good and bad; those who deserve our compassion and those who deserve our contempt. That boundary changes throughout life, as we develop increasing empathy. But the maintenance of _any division at all_ indicates that our "devil" still has its foot in the door. The line exists only to justify its continued presence.

The short answer to "why show evildoers compassion?" is that the only alternative is to be evil.

> _Be kind, for everyone you meet is fighting a great battle._ —Author unknown

There is an aspect within each person's mind that genuinely wants what's best for the world. Sometimes, it is extremely well hidden — as with the "evil people." But it is always there, even when they themselves are not aware of it. To the degree that you can perceive it in others, you can help empower it. This is _kindness_, and it comes from the part of _you_ that only ever wants what's best for the world. It doesn't mean being _nice._ Sometimes the kindest behavior is the opposite of nice.

There is also an aspect within each of us that blocks us from seeing this aspect of others, and even ourselves. In fact, what is blocking you from perceiving it in "bad people" is precisely the same thing that enables their bad behavior in the first place. It is also what allows us to be casually cruel or cold to people we barely know (but may _think_ we know), telling ourselves that we're helping. It is an illusion that we must see through if we are to survive.

> _For so long as the root of wickedness is hidden, it is strong. But when it is recognized, it is dissolved. When it is revealed, it perishes. ... It is powerful because we have not recognized it._ — The Gospel of Philip

All misbehavior — from cutting in line to genuine atrocities — is ultimately enabled by a kind of parasite in the mind. Think of it as that devil on our shoulders. But this devil doesn't just whisper obviously-evil ideas in our ears; no, it alters our very perception, so that it appears okay — or even _righteous_ — to step on certain people. It shields us from confronting the full implications of our words and behaviors.

The "bad people" know perfectly well when what they are doing is wrong, but that knowledge is very cleverly hidden from conscious self-reflection. If you try to viciously force them to confront it, it just drives the parasite deeper into their minds. But something in you already knows this.

When _you_ are in the grip of self-deception — and we've all been there — you do not tolerate contemptuous judgement from others. Why? Because it signals to you that _they_ are in a state of self-deception and are in no position to be judging you. You see them as _bad people_ who need to be put in _their_ place, and feel _even more_ licensed to do whatever you need to do — which in turn convinces them that they were right about you all along. It is the **contempt** that drives this outcome, not the mere **judgement** (in the sense of _wise discernment_).

The same is true when the positions are reversed. Self-righteous outrage feels damn good — i.e., both enjoyable and virtuous — and yet something in you knows that it will just make them dig in their heels. The hard thing to admit is that part of you _wants_ this, because it helps you prove just how _bad_ they are; how totally unlike you. But there's one small problem.

Subconsciously, you can perceive that they are actually in the grip of a terrible demon that you yourself share — indeed, that is controlling your mind _right now_ — and this similarity horrifies you. So you shove them deeper into the abyss to hide this fact from yourself — because the deeper they go, the easier it is to perceive them as _fundamentally defective_, as opposed to fellow humans who badly need help. (Indeed, beyond a certain point, even _they_ cannot consciously perceive this of themselves. At that point, who can really blame us for being cruel?)

This actually creates _new_ evil, but it doesn't feel like that. It feels like you are zeroing in on existing evil; exposing or distilling the hidden evil that is already there. It is as though you are finally catching a hold of the source of darkness in the world, and are finally _punishing_ it. It feels impossibly righteous to be nasty to "bad people."

We think that hating "bad people" is a sign of the good within us, but it's actually a sign of something much darker.

"Bad people" are only able to do what they do thanks to a kind of self-deception that makes harming other people feel okay. The deepest part of them knows perfectly well that what they are doing is wrong, but that knowledge is carefully shielded from conscious self-reflection. It is often so well-shielded that it is impossible for us to believe that it exists at all — but it does.

Exactly the same mechanism lives within our very own minds, though we rarely recognize it. It is what allows us to mock our political opponents with glee. We tell ourselves that they deserve it, and that it is making the world a better place — and we _believe_ this with all our hearts. Except it's not really with _all_ our hearts. The very deepest part of us always knows better, but we carefully shield this knowledge from conscious self-reflection.

It's easy to get lost in speculation about whether such behavior is actually a net harm or good, especially because we don't get to see all of its downstream effects. Even if we do see the second-, third-, etc. order effects — like a humiliated father venting his frustration on his children, who then grow up to become "bad people" themselves — we never make the connection back to our own behavior. And even if by some miracle we do, it is easy to avoid feeling any complicity. Sure, we may have provoked him, but it was _his_ responsibility to handle it with grace. Why didn't he just become a _better person_, like we so clearly intended?

Instead of getting lost in such speculation, there's something else you can do. If you inspect your mind carefully enough during such speculation, you'll discover that it exists primarily to hide something that your subconscious mind is secretly doing from your consciousness.

You see, part of us actually _wants_ "bad people" to become worse. Why? Because this enables us to feel like _better people_ by comparison. But this is extremely hard to admit to ourselves. So our mind finds _exceedingly_ clever ways to push them further into the dark in ways that we can label "righteous." When executed well — which is most of the time — you will never even suspect that you're doing this. The very idea will sound offensively absurd. And if anyone tries to point it out, powerful defense mechanisms will kick in, making it even harder to see — especially if they do it with even a trace of contempt (for reasons we shall soon see).

The truth is that any time you are unkind; any time you feel contempt, malice, or self-righteousness toward _anyone_ for _any reason_; it is your ego operating, attempting to elevate or otherwise enrich yourself at the world's expense. It is _precisely_ the same mechanism that allows the "bad people" to do what they do — and when you give in to yours, you are reinforcing their tendency to give in to theirs. **And this reinforcement isn't an unfortunate side effect of your otherwise-noble intentions; it is in fact the _whole point_.**

To put it more simply: we don't hate bad people to make the world a better place; we hate them to make ourselves feel (and look) good _while making it worse_. In fact, we don't even have to feel hatred. Simply seeing a person as irredeemable is already an unmistakable sign that this terrible process is underway in your subconscious.

I realize this is a hard thing to accept, and that you're unlikely to believe me unless you've seen it clearly yourself. But I swear it is the truth — and it is something that you can discover firsthand yourself.

Seeing the full extent of it is what the Buddhists call _enlightenment._ You discover a shocking sense in which _you are everyone and everything._ The very deepest aspect of your mind is pure compassion, as is that of everyone else. But they've forgotten this, just as you yourself had for innumerable lifetimes. The very last thing you could ever want to do is continue to push them _further_ from realizing it — which is the inevitable effect of perceiving them as fundamentally separate from yourself; of forsaking them.

This is not some bleeding heart idea. Kindness does not mean being nice, or sweet, or tolerant, or understanding. It simply means seeing the nature of reality clearly, so that your behavior inspires others to remember the astonishing truth instead of pushing them away from it. Such behavior may be fierce or even violent; it may look nothing like conventional "kindness" on the surface. But the very deepest part of you always knows the difference.

All of the darkness in the world is intimately connected — and part of it lives within your very own mind. By keeping your portion alive, you ensure that it continues to flourish "out there." That is why everything comes down to knowing ourselves deeply, and healing that secret part of us. Only by doing so can we become aware of our complicity in having reinforced the conditions we decry, and to develop the capacity to take them apart.

All misbehavior — from cutting in line to genuine atrocities — is ultimately enabled by a kind of parasite in the mind. Think of it as that devil on our shoulders. But this devil doesn't just whisper obviously-evil ideas in our ears; no, it alters our very perception, so that it appears okay — or even _righteous_ — to step on certain people. It shields us from confronting the full implications of our words and behaviors.

The "bad people" know perfectly well when what they are doing is wrong, but that knowledge is very cleverly hidden from conscious self-reflection. If you try to viciously force them to confront it, it just drives the parasite deeper into their minds. But something in you already knows this.

When _you_ are in the grip of self-deception — and we've all been there — you do not tolerate contemptuous judgement from others. Why? Because it signals to you that _they_ are in a state of self-deception and are in no position to be judging you. You see them as _bad people_ who need to be put in _their_ place, and feel _even more_ licensed to do whatever you need to do — which in turn convinces them that they were right about you all along. It is the **contempt** that drives this outcome, not the mere **judgement** (in the sense of _wise discernment_).

The same is true when the positions are reversed. Self-righteous outrage feels damn good — i.e., both enjoyable and virtuous — and yet something in you knows that it will just make them dig in their heels. The hard thing to admit is that part of you _wants_ this, because it helps you prove just how _bad_ they are; how totally unlike you. But there's one small problem.

Subconsciously, you can perceive that they are actually in the grip of a terrible demon that you yourself share — indeed, that is controlling your mind _right now_ — and this similarity horrifies you. So you shove them deeper into the abyss to hide this fact from yourself — because the deeper they go, the easier it is to perceive them as _fundamentally defective_, as opposed to fellow humans who badly need help. (Indeed, beyond a certain point, even _they_ cannot consciously perceive this of themselves. At that point, who can really blame us for being cruel?)

This actually creates _new_ evil, but it doesn't feel like that. It feels like you are zeroing in on existing evil; exposing or distilling the hidden evil that is already there. It is as though you are finally catching a hold of the source of darkness in the world, and are finally _punishing_ it. It feels impossibly righteous to be nasty to "bad people."

> _And no wonder, for even Satan masquerades as an angel of light. So it is not strange that his ministers also masquerade as ministers of righteousness._ —2 Corinthians 11:14-16
 
But this is all a smokescreen created by your devil. It knows perfectly well that this behavior darkens the world. In fact, that is its whole game. But it must never let you know this, and so it hides this behind _astonishingly_ seductive justifications that you don't even realize are seductions. All you consciously feel is "I'm fighting evil" — and you have all the evidence to prove it.

What "actually" happened was that under the covers, _their_ devil reached out to yours to offer it a secret handshake — and you signaled agreement simply by feeling contempt. **Contempt is the secret tool by which our devils coordinate, beneath our conscious thresholds.** It is the opposite of kindness; that part of you that wants what's best for everyone. No matter how carefully you disguise it — even from yourself — it always leaks out into the world.

<p align="center" width="100%">
    <img width="300px" src="img/shared-devil.png"> 
</p>

If you look carefully, you will discover that our devils together behave more like a single malevolent distributed entity — the _Devil_, if you will. It is that archetypal "evil conspiracy" that we subconsciously fear exists — the one to which all the rest ultimately owe their existence, and to which they all ultimately report — _and every one of us is secretly in on it_. It remains hidden by keeping our attention fixated perpetually outward, blinding us to our own participation.

Every time we feel malice, contempt, or self-righteousness; any time we are unkind to anyone for any reason, we are secretly feeding the Beast. Every act of unkindness ripples through its terrible body, lowering the threshold for more acts of evil to erupt in faraway locations — for which we will feel absolutely no complicity. But part of us always knows.

To be clear, we're certainly not all equally complicit. There are surely groups of particularly "endarkened" people who consciously conspire to cause great harm, and **we must hold such people accountable**. But when we do so with contempt, we are reinforcing the very conditions that effectively _compel_ their existence — and a deep part of us knows this.

So far I have been calling this all "subconscious," but that's not entirely accurate. The greatest shock is discovering that it was somehow _always_ accessible to consciousness, if we'd just bothered to look. This isn't a judgement of us. We _want_ to look, but something keeps stopping us. Our duty is to discover whatever that is, and heal it.

Nobody ultimately _wants_ to be under the sway of their devil — the key word being "ultimately." There are certainly people who willingly harbor it; those whom we classically think of as "evil." It would be foolish to be "kind" to them in the _conventional_ sense. Yet it is far _more_ foolish to feel malice, because that is **exactly** what their demon wants — and it is also where it is hardest to detect our own self-deception, and the easiest to justify it to others. It is the ultimate trap.

The more you unearth your own demon, the more clearly you see that such people are suffering from a kind of Stockholm syndrome — and the more acutely you feel the malevolence of driving them toward their captor. It smothers what little light is left. (If you believe that they _have_ no light, consider that this may be exactly the "trap" I just described.) It is literally the _worst_ time to be unkind. Unconventional means may be necessary to deal with them, but unkindness never is. This could only be true if "kindness" does not mean what we usually think.

**True kindness is not about being _nice._** It can be fierce or even [violent](https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/dalai-gun/) if necessary. It only requires being lucidly aware of your own capacity for self-deception, and refusing to fall into it. It is about staying connected to your Heart; that part of you that remembers the Truth — the very thing that your parasite is lulling you into forgetting. **Your fight is with the parasite. Hating the host just strengthens it.** 

The more you remember this, the more your very way of being inspires others to remember. Then, bit by bit you notice that even "evil" has no fundamental essence; that it is not a thing that can be "fought." It is not a _presence_, but an _absence._ An absence of what? Of the perception of our deep interconnectedness and fundamental equality. Hating people for not yet perceiving this makes no sense. Only your Light can bring about the better world you most deeply desire — and only you know what form your Light must take to make that happen.

Our true nemesis is never other people, despite obvious appearance to the contrary. It is the delusion that has ensnared all of our minds. The more we come to recognize just how badly it has fooled us, the more we appreciate what the "bad people" are really up against, and the more we can be of genuine service in dispelling it. We each have a role to play, and it always begins with us.

This allows us to feel superior, in a way that can plausibly be defended as righteous. We are only _fighting evil,_ after all.

We maintain a dividing line between the "fundamentally" good and bad; those who deserve our compassion and those who deserve our contempt. That boundary changes throughout life, as we develop increasing empathy. But the maintenance of _any division at all_ indicates that our "devil" still has its foot in the door. The line exists only to justify its continued presence.

The short answer to "why show evildoers compassion?" is that the only alternative is to be evil.

We think that hating "bad people" is a sign of the good within us, but it's actually a sign of something much darker.

"Bad people" are only able to do what they do thanks to a kind of self-deception that makes harming other people feel okay. The deepest part of them knows perfectly well that what they are doing is wrong, but that knowledge is carefully shielded from conscious self-reflection. It is often so well-shielded that it is impossible for us to believe that it exists at all — but it does.

Exactly the same mechanism lives within our very own minds, though we rarely recognize it. It is what allows us to mock our political opponents with glee. We tell ourselves that they deserve it, and that it is making the world a better place — and we _believe_ this with all our hearts. Well, not really _all_ our hearts. The very deepest part of us always knows better, but we carefully shield this knowledge from conscious self-reflection. Sound familiar?

It's easy to get lost in speculation about whether such behavior is actually a net harm or good, especially because we don't get to see all of its downstream effects. But even if we do see the second-, third-, etc. order effects — like a humiliated father venting his frustration on his children, who then grow up to become "bad people" themselves — we never make the connection back to our own behavior.

What if nearly everything you're doing to "fight evil" is secretly strengthening it — and moreover, what if part of you already knows this, but is actively concealing it from your conscious mind?

---

Take a moment to reflect on what's wrong with the world, and bring to mind the people responsible. Don't they seem not only morally defective, but somehow _fundamentally_ so? Such people cannot be helped; they can only be subdued or punished. Treating them with contempt is therefore not only acceptable but positively _righteous_.

This is an illusion. People are only able to misbehave due to a kind of self-deception: part of them knows perfectly well that they are doing wrong, but that knowledge is very cleverly shielded from conscious self-reflection. The more powerful this shielding, the more "evil" the person appears. In fact, this is the very mechanism that has enabled _all the evil there ever was_ — and it is what has enabled our own misbehavior too, if we're honest. We have all skirted our conscience before, pretending either that we couldn't hear it or that we didn't have to. Ours may differ in degree, but not in kind.

We don't mock and shame our political enemies to help them (or anyone else) "see the light," or to make the world a better place. We do it to feel superior while _telling_ ourselves that we're helping. We don't get to see all the downstream effects — a humiliated (and perhaps already-overworked) father taking his embarrassment out on his children, who then grow up to become "bad people" themselves. And even if by some miracle we do, we avoid acknowledging our own complicity. Sure, we may have provoked him, but he could have used it as an opportunity to become _better_. The fact that he didn't just proves that he's _bad_. Of course, there may also be some positive effects, such as temporarily suppressing his misbehavior (in public, anyway). But while it's impossible to prove whether the net result is good or bad, there is something that we _can_ know.

If you look carefully enough into your mind while feeling contempt — and this is _hard_ — you'll discover that it is secretly designed to darken the world. We _want_ our enemies to dig in their heels, because it vindicates our perception of them. If we can confirm that they are as bad as we feared, then we will eventually be justified in unleashing the full extent of our righteous fury — and there is nothing more primally satisfying than violently destroying evil. So we behave in ways that very cleverly trigger their defense mechanisms; to *strengthen* their capacity for self-deception. It is as though we are trying to draw out the evil that we _know_ is there, but in actuality we are creating more. You have **no idea** how good you are at creating and maintaining enemies to support your worldview. That's because the part of you that does this hides itself from your consciousness just as cleverly as "bad people's" misbehavior is hidden from them. It is completely accessible to consciousness, if you look. But somehow, we never look.

<p align="center" width="100%"><img width="300px" src="img/half-evil.png"></p>

This is **profound** self-deception. As such, you are unlikely to believe me when I tell you that this is what is really happening, unless you've already seen it clearly operating in yourself. Our seemingly-innocent perception of people as _fundamentally defective_ is a very clever ploy. It doesn't stay restricted to our minds. We use all of our capacities to _enforce_ it onto reality. Whatever little potential people may have to become free of their darkness, we violently squeeze out of them with our firm conviction that they have no such potential. We don't even have to be in direct contact with them to have this effect: one way or another, our darkness _always_ finds a way to leak into the world, slowly massaging it into the shape we need for everything to make sense to us. And this isn't just a wild hypothesis: you can learn to see it for yourself.

It is a profoundly humbling realization when you first discover it. How did we ever expect the "bad people" to confront their self-deception when we — the "good people" — couldn't detect our own? We are left with no leg to stand on. It is only once you see this clearly that you begin to appreciate the magnitude of what the "bad people" are up against — and that you learn to be of genuine service in fighting it.

> _Why do you look at the speck of sawdust in your brother’s eye and pay no attention to the plank in your own eye? How can you say to your brother, ‘Let me take the speck out of your eye,’ when all the time there is a plank in your own eye? You hypocrite, first take the plank out of your own eye, and then you will see clearly to remove the speck from your brother’s eye._ —Matthew 7:3-5

---

Self-deception is caused by a kind of parasite in the mind whose job is to make us feel different and special. It alters our very perception of reality, making us behave in ways that bolster our self-image.

<p align="center" width="100%"><img width="300px" src="img/parasite.png"></p>

For some people this may be about accumulating wealth or having the "right" skin color, while in others it is simply about being a "good person." That last one may seem noble, but it creates a perverse incentive: the only way to be "good" in the relative sense is for "bad" people to exist. The worse other people become, the better we look by comparison. Thus, our subconscious is on the prowl for people it can make worse. But of course, being "good people," we can't do this to just anyone. So our parasite makes certain people appear _fundamentally defective_, so that harming them suddenly becomes noble. Everyone else must be treated with "compassion," and we make a big show of being their saviors.

<p align="center" width="100%"><img width="300px" src="img/good-vs-bad.png"></p>

This works, for a while. The problem is that the more we do this, the more we begin to suspect a disturbing truth: such behavior isn't evidence of how _different_ we are from the "bad people," but how _similar_ we are. We have two options at this point: to admit and renounce the sordid  game we've been playing, or to double down. For the most part, we choose the latter. We drive this knowledge ever-further out of consciousness, securely locking it away under lock and key. But we cannot outrun it forever.

Sooner or later, the funhouse of mirrors comes crashing down, and we are forced to confront what profound hypocrites we've been. This discovery hurts like Hell — but it also triggers the deepest introspection of our lives. We discover that we never wanted to do this. We never wanted to hurt anyone, and ultimately never _could_ want such a thing — because what we are in our innermost selves is _pure, unadulterated Goodness._ This is a very difficult thing to describe without sounding "woo," but there's no other way to put it without losing its enormity.

The deepest aspect of your mind is pure compassion; Light beyond measure. Its only job is to dispel the darkness in the world. As astonishing as this realization is, what's even more remarkable is that when you see it in yourself, you simultaneously see it in everybody else, too. That's because, in a profound and surprising sense, [you _are_ everybody and everything else](unity.md). In a flash, you discover the full extent of the horrifying confusion that binds humanity. You somehow perceive all the great battles that have led to the creation of "evil people." By forsaking them, you are only forsaking Yourself. Such behavior is itself "evil," but you only did it because you weren't ready to come Home yet. Everyone else was similarly lost, and in their deep confusion tried to prevent you from coming Home too. That's all "evil" ultimately _is_ — an innocent mistake that has grown to truly epic proportions.

I know this story may be hard to swallow, but I promise that it's something you can discover for yourself. Indeed, the deepest part of you already knows it.

By discovering your _absolute_ goodness, you begin to relinquish your need for _relative_ goodness. This undoes the illusion that motivates contempt. You slowly lose the dark urge to push people further into the abyss. Instead, you start to discover a better way. But before we explore that way, let's look at this whole thing from another angle.

---

<p align="center" width="100%"><img width="300px" src="img/devil-vs-devil.png"></p>

When you treat a "bad person" with contempt, you are secretly indicating to their parasite that you are similarly infected. It is a kind of secret handshake — one that their parasite readily accepts. Both you and your enemy will behave in ways that provide the _other_ person's parasite with exactly the excuses it needs to embed itself deeper into its host. In this way, _all_ of our parasites are intimately connected. In fact, they aren't truly separate. If you look closely enough, you'll discover that they behave more like a single distributed malevolent entity, communicating with itself beneath our conscious thresholds. If our parasites are that little devil on our shoulders, then this "entity" is the _Devil._

It continually drives humanity toward various kinds of Armageddon: situations in which everyone is violently proving how _righteous_ they are. It is why the US is headed toward civil war without anyone suspecting their own complicity, and explains bitter [divorces](https://www.gottman.com/blog/this-one-thing-is-the-biggest-predictor-of-divorce/) in which each side feels like the exclusive victim / hero. Nearly the whole world is caught in its terrible sway, evil provoking "righteous" retribution at every turn, without anyone ever noticing the true source of it all.

<p align="center" width="100%"><img width="300px" src="img/shared-devil.png"></p>

You know that "evil global conspiracy" that some people fear exists — the one that's somehow responsible for all the world's ills, yet which hides itself so perfectly that people never even suspect its existence? Well, _this is it_ — the _primordial_ evil conspiracy; the one to which all the rest ultimately owe their existence, and to which they all filter up. The reason we can't pin it down "out there" is because it lives deep within the shadows of all of our own minds. From in there, it knows _exactly_ what buttons to press to prevent us from ever suspecting our own involvement.

It may well be true that "the elites" are playing regular people off each other to take attention away from them, but the Devil is playing a _much_ larger game; one in which the elites are merely pawns. It's not that they mustn't be stopped — it's that the contempt with which we do so reinforces the very conditions that effectively compel their existence in the first place. The details of who is in power may change, but their underlying essence does not — and _cannot_ for as long as we're unaware of our own complicity. Every single act of unkindness that we perpetrate ripples out into the world, influencing faraway events, so that we never notice our connection to them.

<p align="center" width="100%"><img width="300px" src="img/evil-conspiracy.png"></p>

To be clear: there are certainly people who are knowingly and intentionally causing mayhem, and for whom the label "evil" may indeed serve a useful purpose. But if you still perceive this evil as _intrinsic_ to their minds, it only means that your own parasite is still operating, cleverly tempting you. People who are free of their parasites simply do not perceive reality this way. They cannot feel even the slightest trace of malice, contempt, or self-righteousness toward _anyone_. That's because they are able to perceive the part of people that genuinely wants to be _free_ of their parasite. This enables them to act with compassion — the "better way" that we hinted at before.

---

Compassion (aka kindness) does not mean being nice, or sweet, or forgiving, or even understanding. It is simply the absence of self-deception. It can be as fierce (or potentially even violent) as the situation warrants. But it never falls into the illusion of being fundamentally better than anyone, and this makes all the difference.

Again, when you show contempt — for the _person_, not just their ideas or behavior — you are putting your own self-deception on clear display. The deepest part of you knows that you're not ultimately better than anyone (like you are currently pretending to be). And the deepest part of _them_ can see this, even if only subconsciously. They can sense that you are a hypocrite, and this enables them to ignore any genuinely righteous content in your message. Even worse, it teaches them that there _are_ no genuinely decent people; that even the "good people" are just faking it. Any "inner Light" thus becomes even more of a naive myth.

When self-deception is absent, the opposite occurs. Their parasite is confronted with the one thing it cannot stand: authentic Goodness. It is robbed of its power to justify its own existence, because it is in the presence of something immeasurably greater and truer. This is _very_ difficult to describe, but I know you've felt it before. Everything comes down to standing firmly in your inner Light, _especially_ when confronted with the greatest depths of Darkness, when you are most tempted to abandon it. It may not eliminate evil as quickly as you'd like, or be as deliciously satisfying as giving in to self-righteousness, but it is the _only_ way toward the world your heart most deeply desires.

Ultimately, the Darkness is not an entity in its own right, but merely the absence of Light. The fact that it can _behave_ like such an entity — the Devil — is truly one of the most astonishing facts of existence. This is why, as MLK Jr said:

> *Darkness cannot drive out darkness, only light can do that. Hate cannot drive out hate, only love can do that.* ― Martin Luther King, Jr.

His words stand true as ever.

---

Your real enemy is not actually other people, but the remarkable self-deception that has overtaken our minds. Its horsemen are malice, contempt, and self-righteousness. May we uproot these dark tendencies in ourselves so that we may join the fight against it — the only fight that ultimately matters.

> _For so long as the root of wickedness is hidden, it is strong. But when it is recognized, it is dissolved. When it is revealed, it perishes. ... It is powerful because we have not recognized it._ — The Gospel of Philip

What if nearly everything you're doing to "fight evil" is secretly strengthening it — and moreover, what if part of you already knows this, but is actively concealing it from your conscious mind?

---

Take a moment to reflect on what's wrong with the world, and bring to mind the people responsible — the greedy bankers; the hypocritical CEOs; the corrupt politicians (and all who support them). Don't they seem not only morally defective, but somehow _fundamentally_ so? Such people cannot be helped; they can only be subdued or punished. Treating them with contempt is therefore not only acceptable but positively righteous.

This is an illusion. People are only able to misbehave due to a kind of self-deception: part of them knows perfectly well that they are doing wrong, but that knowledge is very cleverly shielded from conscious self-reflection. The more powerful this shielding, the more "evil" the person appears. In fact, it is this very mechanism that has enabled _all the evil there ever was_ — and it has enabled our own misbehavior too, if we're honest. We have all skirted our conscience before, pretending either that we couldn't hear it or that we didn't have to. Our own instances may differ in degree, but not in kind.

When we encounter others in this state, we feel compelled to rub their noses in it. By forcing them to confront just how _bad_ they are, we expect that they will stop — and when they don't, we feel that we have no choice but to escalate. What we can't see is that this itself is profound self-deception — and self-deception is a group phenomenon. By trying to convince people that they are _fundamentally defective_, we are triggering their defense mechanisms — and we _know_ what the result will be.

We don't mock and shame our political enemies to help them (or anyone else) "see the light," or to make the world a better place. We do it to feel superior while _telling_ ourselves that we're helping. We don't get to see all the downstream effects — a humiliated (and perhaps overworked) father taking his embarrassment out on his children, who then grow up to become "bad people" themselves. And even if by some miracle we do, we avoid acknowledging our own complicity. Sure, we may have provoked him, but why didn't he use it as an opportunity to become _better_? This just proves that he's _bad_. Of course, there may also be some positive effects, such as temporarily suppressing his misbehavior (in public, anyway). But while it's hard to know whether the net result is good or bad (think _butterfly effect_), there is something that we _can_ know.

If you look carefully enough into your mind while feeling contempt — and this is hard — you'll discover that it is secretly _designed_ to darken the world. We _want_ our enemies to dig in their heels, because it vindicates our perception of them. If we can confirm that they are as bad as we feared, then we will eventually be justified in unleashing the full extent of our righteous fury — and there is nothing more primally satisfying than violently destroying evil. So we behave in ways that very cleverly trigger their defense mechanisms; to *strengthen* their capacity for self-deception. It is as though we are trying to draw out the evil that we "know" is already in there, but in actuality we are creating more.

You have **no idea** how good you are at creating and maintaining enemies to justify and reinforce your view of the world; your infallible inner story of "good guys" and "bad guys." That's because the part of you that does this hides itself from your consciousness just as cleverly as "bad people's" misbehavior is hidden from them. It is completely accessible to consciousness, if you look. But somehow, we never look. Something within us knows that if we were forced to confront our own self-deception, our whole perception of the world — and the stories of blame that scaffold it — would suddenly come crashing down.

<p align="center" width="100%"><img width="300px" src="img/half-evil.png"></p>

It is **profound** self-deception. As such, you are unlikely to believe me when I tell you that this is what is really happening, unless you've already seen it clearly operating in yourself. Our seemingly-innocent perception of people as _fundamentally defective_ is not so innocent. It does not stay confined to our own minds: we use all of our capacities to _enforce_ it onto reality. Whatever little potential that people may have to become free of their darkness, we violently squeeze out of them with our firm conviction that they have no such potential. One way or another, our darkness _always_ finds a way to leak into the world, slowly massaging it into the shape we need for everything to make sense to us. Even if we're not in direct contact with our target, we ensure that our contempt darkens the minds of those in our orbit — our "allies" and bystanders. And this isn't just a wild hypothesis: you can learn to see it for yourself.

It is a profoundly humbling realization when you first discover it. How did we ever expect the "bad people" to confront their self-deception when we — the "good people" — couldn't detect our own? We are left with no leg to stand on. It is only once you see this clearly that you begin to appreciate the magnitude of what the "bad people" are up against — and that you learn to be of genuine service in fighting it.

> _Why do you look at the speck of sawdust in your brother’s eye and pay no attention to the plank in your own eye? How can you say to your brother, ‘Let me take the speck out of your eye,’ when all the time there is a plank in your own eye? You hypocrite, first take the plank out of your own eye, and then you will see clearly to remove the speck from your brother’s eye._ —Matthew 7:3-5

---

Self-deception is caused by a kind of parasite in the mind. Think of it as that little devil on your shoulder. But unlike in the cartoons, this devil doesn't just whisper obviously-bad ideas in your ear; no, it alters your very perception at such a fundamental level that you don't even realize you're being seduced. You just see it as "reality."

<p align="center" width="100%"><img width="300px" src="img/parasite.png"></p>

The key point is that it is a _parasite._ Unlike your angel — which is intrinsic to your mind, and represents your fundamental goodness — your devil can be evicted, bit by bit. But every time you listen to it — that is, every time you give in to your self-deception — it burrows a little bit deeper into your mind, feeling more and more like "you" with each step. The more this happens, the more you appear "evil" to others.

People don't listen to it because they're _bad_ — even though it (very convincingly) appears that way. Instead, the confluence of experiences they've had — which you can think of as having accumulated over lifetimes, or perhaps in what we now think of as their epigenome — somehow makes them feel like listening to it is the "right" thing to do. They have been very cleverly lulled to sleep.

The point is not to feel sorry for evil people, but to gain insight into the bizarre mechanism that has overtaken their minds. The most important thing to see here is that the very same mechanism exists in yours. It is _your_ parasite that makes you see them (or anyone else) as _fundamentally defective_; to see their evil as somehow intrinsic to their minds.

It is well known that even Hitler thought that he was doing something noble. I'll refrain from quoting him directly[^Hitler], but he genuinely believed that he was saving the world from the Devil, which had somehow manifested into the world as the Jewish people. It is easy for us to recognize this as profound delusion, but it is much harder to see that the vile misperception that affected him is _precisely_ the same one that makes us perceive him as "intrinsically" evil; something that we ourselves could never ever be.

This is a subtle point, so I don't want it to be misunderstood. He was surely deluded enough to deserve the label "evil," and being kind to him in the conventional sense would have been dangerously stupid. But the belief that he (and the Nazi army) were somehow _fundamentally_ different from us is a dark lie that our parasite uses to invite itself deeper into our minds, bit by bit. Its whole trick is to make you believe that you are special and immune; that only _other_ people are susceptible. This is how you learn to overlook your own misbehavior, quickly becoming convinced that you either don't have any, or that yours isn't causing much harm to the world.

---

Our parasite leverages our primal need to see ourselves as "good people" to cause mayhem. This instinct may seem noble, but it creates a perverse incentive: the only way to be "good" in the relative sense is for "bad" people to exist. The worse other people become, the better we look by comparison. Thus, our subconscious is on the prowl for people it can _make_ worse. But of course, being "good people," we can't do this to just anyone. So our parasite makes us see some people as _fundamentally defective_, so that harming them suddenly becomes noble. Everyone else must be treated with "compassion," and we make a big show of being their saviors.

<p align="center" width="100%"><img width="300px" src="img/good-vs-bad.png"></p>

This works — for a while. The problem is that the more we do this, the more we begin to suspect a disturbing truth: such behavior isn't evidence of how _different_ we are from the "bad people," but how _similar_ we are. We have two options at this point: to admit and renounce the sordid  game we've been playing, or to double down. For the most part, we choose the latter. We drive this knowledge ever-further out of consciousness, securely locking it away under lock and key. But we cannot outrun it forever.

Sooner or later, the funhouse of mirrors comes crashing down, and we are forced to confront what profound hypocrites we've been. This discovery hurts like Hell — but it also triggers the deepest introspection of our lives. We discover that we never wanted to do this. We never wanted to hurt anyone, and ultimately never _could_ want such a thing — because what we are in our innermost selves is _pure, unadulterated Goodness._ This is a very difficult thing to describe without sounding "woo," but there's no other way to put it without losing its enormity.

The deepest aspect of your mind is pure compassion; Light beyond measure. Its only job is to dispel the darkness in the world. As astonishing as this realization is, what's even more remarkable is that when you see it in yourself, you simultaneously see it in everybody else, too. That's because, in a profound and surprising sense, [you _are_ everybody and everything else](unity.md). In a flash, you discover the full extent of the horrifying confusion that binds humanity. You somehow perceive all the great battles that have led to the creation of "evil people." By forsaking them, you are only forsaking Yourself. Such behavior is itself "evil," but you only did it because you weren't ready to come Home yet. Everyone else was similarly lost, and in their deep confusion tried to prevent you from coming Home too. That's all "evil" ultimately _is_ — an innocent mistake that has grown to truly epic proportions.

I know this story may be hard to swallow, but I promise that it's something you can discover for yourself. Indeed, the deepest part of you already knows it.

By discovering your _absolute_ goodness, you begin to relinquish your need for _relative_ goodness. This undoes the illusion that motivates contempt. You slowly lose the dark urge to push people further into the abyss. Instead, you start to discover a better way. But before we explore that way, let's look at this whole thing from another angle.

---

<p align="center" width="100%"><img width="300px" src="img/devil-vs-devil.png"></p>

When you treat a "bad person" with contempt, you are secretly indicating to their parasite that you are similarly infected. It is a kind of secret handshake — one that their parasite readily accepts. Both you and your enemy will behave in ways that provide the _other_ person's parasite with exactly the excuses it needs to embed itself deeper into its host. In this way, _all_ of our parasites are intimately connected. In fact, they aren't truly separate. If you look closely enough, you'll discover that they behave more like a single distributed malevolent entity, communicating with itself beneath our conscious thresholds. If our parasites are that little devil on our shoulders, then this "entity" is the _Devil._

It continually drives humanity toward various kinds of Armageddon: situations in which everyone is violently proving how _righteous_ they are. It is why the US is headed toward civil war without anyone suspecting their own complicity, and explains bitter [divorces](https://www.gottman.com/blog/this-one-thing-is-the-biggest-predictor-of-divorce/) in which each side feels like the exclusive victim / hero. Nearly the whole world is caught in its terrible sway, evil provoking "righteous" retribution at every turn, without anyone ever noticing the true source of it all.

<p align="center" width="100%"><img width="300px" src="img/shared-devil.png"></p>

You know that "evil global conspiracy" that some people fear exists — the one that's somehow responsible for all the world's ills, yet which hides itself so perfectly that people never even suspect its existence? Well, _this is it_ — the _primordial_ evil conspiracy; the one to which all the rest ultimately owe their existence, and to which they all filter up. The reason we can't pin it down "out there" is because it lives deep within the shadows of all of our own minds. From in there, it knows _exactly_ what buttons to press to prevent us from ever suspecting our own involvement.

It may well be true that "the elites" are playing regular people off each other to take attention away from them, but the Devil is playing a _much_ larger game; one in which the elites are merely pawns. It's not that they mustn't be stopped — it's that the contempt with which we do so reinforces the very conditions that effectively compel their existence in the first place. The details of who is in power may change, but their underlying essence does not — and _cannot_ for as long as we're unaware of our own complicity. Every single act of unkindness that we perpetrate ripples out into the world, influencing faraway events, so that we never notice our connection to them.

<p align="center" width="100%"><img width="300px" src="img/evil-conspiracy.png"></p>

To be clear: there are certainly people who are knowingly and intentionally causing mayhem, and for whom the label "evil" may indeed serve a useful purpose. But if you still perceive this evil as _intrinsic_ to their minds, it only means that your own parasite is still operating, cleverly tempting you. People who are free of their parasites simply do not perceive reality this way. They cannot feel even the slightest trace of malice, contempt, or self-righteousness toward _anyone_. That's because they are able to perceive the part of people that genuinely wants to be _free_ of their parasite. This enables them to act with compassion — the "better way" that we hinted at before.

---

Compassion (aka kindness) does not mean being nice, or sweet, or forgiving, or even understanding. It is simply the absence of self-deception. It can be as fierce (or potentially even violent) as the situation warrants. But it never falls into the illusion of being fundamentally better than anyone, and this makes all the difference.

Again, when you show contempt — for the _person_, not just their ideas or behavior — you are putting your own self-deception on clear display. The deepest part of you knows that you're not ultimately better than anyone (like you are currently pretending to be). And the deepest part of _them_ can see this, even if only subconsciously. They can sense that you are a hypocrite, and this enables them to ignore any genuinely righteous content in your message. Even worse, it teaches them that there _are_ no genuinely decent people; that even the "good people" are just faking it. Any "inner Light" thus becomes even more of a naive myth.

When self-deception is absent, the opposite occurs. Their parasite is confronted with the one thing it cannot stand: authentic Goodness. It is robbed of its power to justify its own existence, because it is in the presence of something immeasurably greater and truer. This is _very_ difficult to describe, but I know you've felt it before. Everything comes down to standing firmly in your inner Light, _especially_ when confronted with the greatest depths of Darkness, when you are most tempted to abandon it. It may not eliminate evil as quickly as you'd like, or be as deliciously satisfying as giving in to self-righteousness, but it is the _only_ way toward the world your heart most deeply desires.

Ultimately, the Darkness is not an entity in its own right, but merely the absence of Light. The fact that it can _behave_ like such an entity — the Devil — is truly one of the most astonishing facts of existence. This is why, as MLK Jr said:

> *Darkness cannot drive out darkness, only light can do that. Hate cannot drive out hate, only love can do that.* ― Martin Luther King, Jr.

His words stand true as ever.

---

Your real enemy is not actually other people, but the remarkable self-deception that has overtaken our minds. Its horsemen are malice, contempt, and self-righteousness. May we uproot these dark tendencies in ourselves so that we may join the fight against it — the only fight that ultimately matters.

Why are we unkind to people who we perceive as "bad"? The answer seems obvious: we do it to make the world a better place. But this is an insidious lie. It explains why we're not _nice_, but not why we're not _kind_. Nice is about being pleasant and agreeable, which are clearly unhelpful in some situations. But kindness means something much deeper. It is the right motivation in _every_ circumstance.

---

A healthy mind harbors no hostility under any circumstances. That's not because it is meek or even "tolerant" per se. It can be fierce or even violent in subduing evil. These can be forms of kindness too. But it cannot feel even a _trace_ of malice, contempt, or self-righteousness, because it has seen something clearly.

It has seen that those sentiments are lies: they exist *only* to help us get away with something that we otherwise could not. We want to behave in some way that is self-serving, which we couldn't do if we could see the full humanity of the person we are attacking. So a dark aspect of our mind tricks us into perceiving them as somehow _fundamentally defective_. That way, we won't feel bad harming them. It might not even be obvious what we're getting out of it. For some, it is financial gain or feelings of power, but very often it is (ironically) just to bolster our self-image as "good people," who therefore deserve to get away with more. A deep part of us recognizes this deceit, but we carefully hide it away from conscious self-reflection.

We feel like we are teaching the other person a lesson, but they may not even be (knowingly) doing anything wrong. They may be honestly doing the best they can, in which case we're harming an innocent person. But even if they _are_ knowingly doing wrong, it's only because they're under the sway of _precisely_ the same self-deception that we presently are. Either way, the only "lesson" they learn is that this world is a dark and phony place; that the Light is just a myth. Whatever temporary benefit we may achieve — such as suppressing their (public) misbehavior — this powerfully reinforces their self-deception. This in turn proves to _us_ that the world is a nasty place, thus requiring our "righteous" escalation.

<p align="center" width="100%"><img width="300px" src="img/half-evil.png"></p>

You have _no idea_ how good your subconscious is at telegraphing your darkness to others while simultaneously hiding it from yourself. This combination sets up perfect feedback loop, in which you can trigger the darkness in others while convincing yourself that it's their fault. And this is far from the only way that your darkness leaks out. As long as you are harboring any hardness or hostility in your heart, it _will_ find its way into the world, one way or another, without your conscious knowledge. Except it's not truly unconscious: it is always available to consciousness, if we choose to look. The problem is that we _choose not to look_.

Here is the choice that confronts each one of us: to become aware of having chosen to look away — and thereby discover that this is how _all_ evil works, and that our self-righteous judgement therefore has no basis whatsoever — or to continue to delude ourselves, descending into deeper and deeper realms of self-deception, darkening the world in increasingly clever ways, ever-more convinced of our righteousness.

---

Evil is actually an absence masquerading as a presence. The absence of what? Of a particular insight.

The ultimate truth is that you are everyone and everything, in a profound and surprising sense. It is said that this is only fully realized upon _enlightenment,_ but all of us can sense it at all times, to some degree or another. Yet we hide it from ourselves. It is only by overlooking this astonishing truth that anyone is able to harm anyone else (or our planet), through objectification; dehumanization. This is the core of self-deception; the origin of all contempt; the root of all evil.

But although it is an absence, it behaves very convincingly like a presence. When you look in the eyes of someone in the grip of this delusion, you see the _presence_ of evil. This is the moment of truth. If you choose profound honesty, you will be forced to admit that the same potential exists within you, and you will gain at least some insight in how to alleviate theirs, commensurate with your willingness; your deep compassion. This will contribute to the healing of the world. Compassion is never truly "for" a person, but for everything at once.

Your darkness, on the other hand, seduces you into believing that you could never be like them; that you are _fundamentally superior_. If you accede, you will perceive them as _intrinsically defective_, thus inspiring contempt. Their darkness will instantly recognize itself in you, and the game is on. Now both yours and theirs are secretly _allied_, knowing that they can freely spread darkness in the world with the implicit permission of you, their hosts. You have both willingly gone unconscious; delegated your sovereignty.

<p align="center" width="100%"><img width="300px" src="img/parasite.png"></p>

It is that devil on your shoulder. It is a kind of mental parasite, fundamentally extrinsic to your mind. But unlike in the cartoons, it doesn't just whisper obviously-bad ideas into your ear. No, it alters your very perception so that other people's devils appear intrinsic. This way, you will feel justified in shoving them deeper into the abyss in the name of "good." Everyone else is treated sweetly and gingerly, as if to prove to ourselves and the world which team we are fighting for.

<p align="center" width="100%"><img width="300px" src="img/good-vs-bad.png"></p>

But our devils are more than just allied. With enough sensitivity, you will see that they behave more like outgrowths of a single distributed malevolent entity — the _Devil,_ if you will. It hides itself in our subconscious, flowing freely between minds, with none of us ever detecting its presence, convinced that we are uniquely immune to its sinister charms. It continually drives humanity toward various kinds of Armageddon: situations in which everyone is violently proving how _righteous_ they are. It is why the US is headed toward civil war without anyone suspecting their own complicity, and explains bitter [divorces](https://www.gottman.com/blog/this-one-thing-is-the-biggest-predictor-of-divorce/) in which each side feels like the exclusive victim / hero. Nearly the whole world is caught in its terrible sway, evil provoking "righteous" retribution at every turn, without anyone ever noticing the true source of it all.

It is said that the elites are playing us off each other to take attention off of them, but the Devil is playing a _much_ bigger game — one in which even the elites are merely pawns. It tricks you into hating them specifically so that you will empower it — and thereby empower _them_. It is the reason that nothing ever seems to change. It accomplishes this by convincing you that your compassion isn't powerful enough to combat their evil; that your darkness is required.

It is that "evil global conspiracy" that some people fear exists: a covert entity responsible for all the world's ills, that hides itself so perfectly that nobody ever suspects its existence, let alone that they are in on it. They cannot even see it when it is clearly and explicitly pointed out. It is _that_ good. It is the _primordial_ evil conspiracy; the one to which all the rest ultimately filter up, and to which they owe their existence. Every act of unkindness you've ever perpetrated on anyone; all the hardness you carry in your heart; has only ever been in its service. The evil conspiracy really exists, and (nearly) every one of us is secretly in on it. It is our refusal to acknowledge this that keeps it alive.

The only way to fight it is to stop playing its sordid game and remember a power that you have that is _far greater_.

---

The Light is not just a myth; it is your most fundamental nature. Whereas your devil is extrinsic, your compassion is _intrinsic._ It is the very root of who and what you are. When you discover this in its entirety, you see it in everyone else, too — because, after all, they _are_ you. It is your most sacred duty as a human to remember this, so that you can share it freely with others (though paradoxically, if you still see them as "other," and yourself as their noble savior, then this isn't quite it).

Your compassion is not weak — indeed, it is the most powerful force there is. It is the _only_ thing that can genuinely dispel evil, for precisely the same reason that light is the only thing that can dispel darkness: the latter is nothing but the _absence_ of the former. Yet treating it like a presence can be skillful, because then you will not underestimate its terrifying capacity to grip minds and bring the whole world to its knees. This compassion must be paired with _wisdom,_ which is the knowledge of how best to put it into fierce and uncompromising practice. That takes time to develop, and is beyond the scope of this piece. It is only with great wisdom that one can evict the darkness from the most infected of minds without getting sucked in oneself.

Such compassion may look nothing like "compassion" in the conventional sense. It can look like mocking or shaming, violence, or even _apparent_ contempt. Almost nothing is off-limits. Yet it has the opposite effect of the same actions undertaken with contempt. Two behaviors that look nearly identical on the surface can thus have dramatically different long-term effects; one sending ripples of darkness into the world, and the other of Light. Please forgive the poetic expression; I don't know how else to put it. But it is something you can discover concretely. The darkness preys on our inability to distinguish the two, which is how it convinces us that our intentions don't matter, that compassion is weak, and that contempt is righteous.

Our enemy is never truly other people, but the darkness that has overtaken all of our minds. May we learn to see this clearly, and free this world of the illusion that has overtaken it. May we remember our Light.

> _For so long as the root of wickedness is hidden, it is strong. But when it is recognized, it is dissolved. When it is revealed, it perishes. ... It is powerful because we have not recognized it._ — The Gospel of Philip

We've all heard that "hate cannot drive out hate," but is it really true? What about something milder, like contempt? Surely contempt for _bad people_ can make the world a better place — certainly more so than being kind?

---

The truth is that every one of us engages in small (or not so small) behaviors to help ourselves gain an advantage at the expense of the world — and we have varying degrees of self-awareness about how and when (and even whether) we do this. Part of us knows _perfectly well_ that our behavior is wrong — according to our _own_ deepest standards, and not anyone else's — but that knowledge is very carefully shielded from conscious self-reflection; from the part of us that would put an end to it if only it knew. Instead, all we hear is our own clever justifications.

Of course, some people's behavior is so egregious that it's hard to believe that _any_ part of them doesn't know. It seems like even their "deepest standards" are rotten. But what's actually happening is that their self-deception is _especially_ powerful. If you want a world in which people don't act that way, you have to end the phenomenon of self-deception. Looking around at human behavior, this seems like an impossible task. People appear intrinsically selfish. But the truth is that we make it much harder than it has to be, by compounding it with our own self-deception.

If you look carefully enough into your mind while feeling malice, contempt[^contempt], or even self-righteousness, you'll find that they are _always_ self-deception: part of you is knowingly darkening the world in some way to benefit yourself. It might not even be obvious what you're getting out of it. For some people it is about financial gain or feelings of power, but very often it is (ironically) just to bolster our self-image as "good people" — who therefore deserve to get away with more.

[^contempt]: It is important to distinguish between contempt for ideas and behaviors, and for people themselves. The former can indeed be helpful.

<p align="center" width="100%"><img width="300px" src="./img/half-evil.png"></p>

When your contempt is directed at "bad people," they subconsciously recognize what you're actually doing, which makes them feel more justified in doing it themselves. This in turn proves to you that they really are delusional and irredeemable, which licenses you to escalate your righteous wrath. It is impossible to overstate how clever your subconscious is at telegraphing your darkness to others while hiding it from yourself, so that you can provoke them while convincing yourself that it's their fault. Your target doesn't even have to be present: any hardness or hostility that you harbor in your heart _will_ find its way into the world, one way or another, darkening it without your conscious knowledge. Unfortunately, it's not truly unconscious: it is always available to consciousness, if only we choose to look. But we _choose not to look_.

---

> _And no wonder, for even Satan masquerades as an angel of light. So it is not strange that his ministers also masquerade as ministers of righteousness._ —2 Corinthians 11:14-16
 
This is how we darken the world while supposedly "fighting evil." What's happening on the _surface_ of our minds affects reality far less than the stuff happening much deeper; in places that we may not even have conscious access to yet. It doesn't matter how noble your stated intentions are: if there's self-deception operating, you _will_ make the world a darker place; one more rife with self-deception — and you will be flawlessly convinced that you are helping. In fact, your behavior may actually _be_ helpful — at least for a time. It may temporarily suppress their misbehavior (in public, anyway), but under the surface, the darkness is spreading.

It would be unkind to blame you for this, even though part of you knows it fully well. That's because the very deepest part of you doesn't actually want to be doing it. But something in you feels that it doesn't have a choice; that the cruel world has forced your hand, and you're doing what you must. This is all completely understandable — for both you and literally everyone else, if you look hard enough. Everyone is caught in some version of the very same trap; some so deeply that we cannot recognize it. Your choice is to either shove them deeper in — which you will surely get away with, given how "righteous" it is in the eyes of the people you surround yourself with — or to help pull them out; to extend them the grace that you yourself so profoundly deserve — and to thereby rid the world of at least a tiny bit of "evil."

The latter is called _kindness_ or _compassion_. To be clear, it does **not** mean being nice, or gentle, or tolerant, or even understanding. It simply means being free of self-deception; of the pernicious illusion that you are somehow special and incorruptible. We judge[^judge] others because somewhere deep down we are judging ourselves. When the latter stops, the former does too — and the latter only ends when we have finally unearthed every last place in which we hide our true intentions from ourselves. Once this happens, it is literally impossible to feel contempt, because you see clearly that this sentiment exists _only_ to perpetuate dark patterns in the world; patterns that enable us all to avoid that within us which we're not yet ready to confront.

[^judge]: To be clear, "judgement" here means _contemptuous_ judgement. Judgement in the sense of wise discernment is of course good. Another word like this is "outrage," which often has a self-righteous component to it, much to everyone's detriment.

Genuine kindness can be fierce or even violent. Almost nothing is off-limits. It may look nothing like "kindness" from the outside, but on the inside you always know — and subconsciously, so does everyone else. Your judgement then carries the weight of authenticity, which their minds cannot use as an excuse for more self-deception. It is as though their darkness can no longer get the "grip" it needs to justify itself. It is instead confronted by a blinding Light, which is the one thing that it cannot withstand. It's not even something that you are _doing_, per se; it is simply what remains in the mind once self-deception — darkness — has vanished. Not just for you or the "good people," but for everyone.

Make no mistake: it would be foolish to pretend that evil doesn't exist. It surely does in some sense. In fact, from a certain perspective, it appears sentient; almost intelligent. It is that devil on your shoulder — but unlike in the cartoons, it doesn't just whisper obviously-bad ideas in your ear; no, it alters your very perception such that evil appears unmistakably _righteous._ You and I may be enemies, but our devils are secretly allied; yours triggering mine, which triggers yours back, etc., leading to that all-too-familiar descent into Hell. In fact, if you look carefully, you will see that our devils aren't truly separate: they behave more like a _single distributed malevolent entity_: the _Devil_, if you will.

It is that "evil global conspiracy" that some people fear exists: a covert entity responsible for all the world's ills, that hides itself so perfectly that nobody ever suspects its existence, let alone that they themselves are in on it. They cannot even see it when it is clearly and explicitly pointed out. It is _that_ good.

---

Your enemy is never truly other people, but the darkness that has ensnared all of our minds. It is not _intrinsic_ to any mind: that is a sinister illusion that the "Devil" uses to get you to do its dark bidding. Ultimately, MLK indeed said it best:

> *Darkness cannot drive out darkness, only light can do that. Hate cannot drive out hate, only love can do that.*

His words are wiser than we know, even all these years later. May we learn to recognize the profound truth therein — for all of our sakes.

> _Be kind, for everyone you meet is fighting a great battle._ —Author unknown

Why do wise people urge compassion for evildoers? Are they being naïve? Or could it be that they see something that we don't?

---

Consider the "bad people" — the greedy bankers, hypocritical CEOs, corrupt politicians, etc. — and how they're able to screw over others without apparent remorse. It really makes your blood boil, doesn't it? What has happened is that their minds have altered their perception of reality such that other people appear fundamentally inferior; subhuman, and thus acceptable to harm.

Do they know that they're doing this? Well, yes and no. Part of them knows _perfectly well_, of course — but that knowledge is cleverly shielded from conscious self-reflection. All they hear are their own justifications. It is this state that has enabled _all the evil there ever was_ — and it has enabled our own misbehavior too, if we're honest. Every one of us has skirted our conscience before, pretending either that we couldn't hear it or that we didn't have to listen. We have secretly licensed ourselves to gain some advantage at the expense of the world. Our examples may differ in degree, but not in kind.

This mind-state is infectious: simply by engaging in it, the "bad people" induce it in others. The dark part of their mind is trying to spread it, because the more normalized it becomes, the less they will have to confront it in themselves. This allows it to remain hidden. That part _wants_ you to hate them — because the darker your perception becomes, the more you will abandon your own deepest values, licensing yourself to behave in ways that you otherwise couldn't, and thereby spreading the infection yourself. But _you won't realize that you're doing this._ You will feel flawlessly convinced that you are "fighting evil" — and how could that ever be wrong?

You will even have evidence to prove it. Your darkness can indeed suppress other people's misbehavior — at least, their _public_ misbehavior, for a time. You will thus convince yourself that it "worked." But even if you manage to violently eradicate your enemies, doing so from this profoundly dark place will powerfully awaken the shadows of every person whose mind it touches, directly or indirectly, "friend" or "foe" — and a secret part of your mind will know that did this, because it is _doing it on purpose_. You have no idea how good your mind is at generating darkness while convincing you that it's somebody else's fault.

<p align="center" width="100%"><img width="300px" src="img/devil-vs-devil.png"></p>

In that darkened state, you're not just licensing yourself to hate "bad people," like you tell yourself. Your mind uses this liminal space to get away with all manner of hidden desires; desires that you may not even realize you have. For some people, it is about money or power, but for others it is (ironically) about looking and feeling like "good people" — people who therefore deserve to get away with _more_.

What happened is that your darkness heard the clarion call of theirs, recognizing it as a perfect opportunity to lure you into this state for its own sinister purposes, under the guise of "good." It is a kind of "secret handshake" between their shadow and yours. You have now become a silent beacon of the darkness yourself — but you won't (consciously) recognize it. You will be convinced that it is noble, and your ideology will support this belief.

What happens on the surface of our minds — our "good intentions" — ultimately matters far less than the covert activity taking place underneath; activity that most of us are normally unconscious of. It is this hidden activity that secretly runs the world.

<p align="center" width="100%"> <img width="300px" src="img/evil-above-world.png"> </p>

Contempt for other people (as opposed to their _beliefs_ or _behaviors_) is only ever a sign of self-deception. Any action taken from this state _will_ darken the world in some way that you will be unconscious of — except that it's not truly unconscious. **It is entirely accessible to consciousness, if only we look. The problem is that we choose not to look — for _precisely_ the same reason that the "bad people" never do:** beyond a certain point, it is too painful to confront what we have done. We are in too deep.

> _And no wonder, for even Satan masquerades as an angel of light. So it is not strange that his ministers also masquerade as ministers of righteousness._ —2 Corinthians 11:14-16

The more carefully you look, the more you discover the distinctive fingerprints of your own darkness imprinted on events distant in time and space; events that you previously never would have dreamed of having any connection to. All the darkness you have ever leaked into this world still remains, patiently waiting for you to clean it up — and you can identify it in the places that trigger you the most; the places that elicit _self-righteous outrage_. At the same time, these are where you will feel the most justified to layer on _more_ — and where your "allies" will support you in doing so. In fact, this is what most "alliance" really is: dividing us into categories of justifications for cruelty. This way, we never suspect our true enemy. It is the _perfect_ trap. In fact, it almost smells... designed.

From a certain perspective, the darkness appears sentient; even intelligent. It is that phenomenon that the ancients knew as the _Devil_[^devil]: a distributed malevolent entity manipulating all of our minds, communicating with itself beneath our conscious thresholds; subtly altering our perceptions, while convincing us that it doesn't exist — or that it doesn't exist within _us_, the righteous. Ironically, this is the _surest_ sign that our mind has been overtaken.

In more modern terms, it is the "evil global conspiracy": a secret cabal pulling all the strings, and yet hidden so well that nobody even suspects its existence — let alone that _part of their own mind is secretly in on it_. It is the _primordial_ evil conspiracy; the one to which all the rest owe their existence, and to which they ultimately filter up — and we are its minions.

<p align="center" width="100%"><img width="300px" src="./img/shared-devil.png"></p>

You can think of this as an allegory, but you can also learn to perceive it clearly and directly.

It is easy to sense its sinister presence in classically dark places – the archetypal "locker room" in which men dehumanize women, which later manifests in unspeakable conduct. With a little more sensitivity, you can detect it in the places where people gather to _hate_ men for doing this — and with more still, in the defensive reactions that cause men to believe that no such phenomenon could possibly exist simply because they are unable to see it yet. On and on it goes, effortlessly slithering through minds.

Countless similar patterns exist, for race, religion... you name it. Just visit any Facebook group and witness throngs of people being casually cruel to each other, believing that they're making things better — not realizing that they are simply feeding the Beast. We are all fighting a common enemy, and yet it has convinced us that we will overcome it by viciously fighting each other.

[^devil]: Though in some versions, he is just a _tempter_: he is checking whether you will abandon God (or your inner Light) but has no power (or even desire) to make you do so. I like this variant, because it makes it clear that that decision is entirely on us.

The elites may well be playing us off each other to take attention off of them, but the Devil is playing a _much_ bigger game — one in which even the elites are merely pawns. It tricks you into hating them specifically to draw your attention away from its presence in your own mind — the one place you actually have the power to dispel it, and from there, liberate other minds. It convinces you that your compassion isn't powerful enough to combat evil; that it is something soft and weak. This is a dark lie. Compassion is the _only_ thing capable of genuinely dispelling evil — because it is the only condition that is genuinely _free_ of it.

---

The classic image of the angel and devil on your shoulders is almost correct, except for two things. 

First, your devil doesn't just whisper obviously-bad ideas in your ear, like in the cartoons; no, it alters your very perception such that certain evils appear unmistakably righteous. It is extrinsic to your mind; a kind of parasite — and like all parasites, it can be evicted.

<p align="center" width="100%"><img width="300px" src="./img/parasite.png"></p>

Your angel, on the other hand, is intrinsic. It is a metaphor for that place in your mind that the devil can never touch; the very deepest part of you; your fundamental goodness. It is what remains when all self-deception evaporates.

Your angel can see perfectly well that other people's minds have merely been hijacked by their devils; that it's not intrinsic to their nature. Even those who have _knowingly invited it in_ — and make no mistake, some people have — deserve to be freed of it. Contempt is nothing but the violent urge to shove them _deeper into_ its clutches, where we will feel even more licensed to be cruel, in a vicious feedback loop.

That is why your devil's cleverest trick is to make _other people's_ devils appear intrinsic. Think about the "bad people." Don't they seem _fundamentally morally defective,_ and thus entirely unlike us? By definition such people cannot be helped; they can only be punished or subdued. The truth is, you don't actually know who can be freed and who cannot — and the only reason to believe they cannot is to make harming them feel righteous. It is a trap. Compassion is simply freedom from this pernicious illusion.

---

> _For so long as the root of wickedness is hidden, it is strong. But when it is recognized, it is dissolved. When it is revealed, it perishes. ... It is powerful because we have not recognized it._ — The Gospel of Philip

Compassion does not have to be nice. In fact, the more ensnared by darkness a person is, the more fierce — or even _violent_ — compassion for them must be. It can look like mocking and shaming, or even _apparent_ contempt or hatred. Almost nothing is off-limits. At the same time, the easier it becomes to lie to yourself about your true intentions: are you being of genuine service to the world, or using it as cover for something much darker?

It is precisely this difficulty that the Devil uses to sneak into your mind undetected. It knows that you will use the _content_ of your thoughts — "oh, I'm just protecting the innocent" — to determine the morality of your actions, and so it generates exceedingly clever justifications that it knows will fool you. The more you listen to it, the smarter it gets, until even thoughts that once would have struck you as obviously-evil now seem unmistakably good. That is why you must learn to see _past_ your thoughts, and hear a voice that is much deeper.

[//]: # (This is why "the road to hell is paved with good intentions": because our conscious intentions are rarely our true intentions.)

<p align="center" width="100%"><img width="300px" src="./img/half-evil.png"></p>

Part of you _always_ knows which voice you are listening to, and everything comes down to becoming conscious of it. I can't tell you how to do it, but luckily, the deepest part of you already knows. There are also a few hints that can be helpful.

If there is even a _trace_ of malice, contempt (for the person), or self-righteousness, then it is *always* your shadow. Same with seeing the world in black and white: dividing people into the _intrinsically_ good and bad; victims and perpetrators; those who deserve your compassion and those who deserve your hatred[^films]. It will make a big show of being sweet to the victims and cruel to the perpetrators, as a way of keeping you in the dark about what is really going. You will not recognize it in yourself, but others very much can (if only subconsciously). Unless they are relatively free of the darkness themselvdes, they will feel contempt for you, thus "unknowingly" perpetuating the cycle.

---

Your true enemy is not other people, but the darkness that has infected all of our minds. Everything comes down to seeing how it has hijacked both ourselves and others, and recognizing what help we can offer to free them of it — whether that requires patience and understanding, or wrath and ferocity. The more you become free yourself, the more you recognize what is needed in others.

[^films]: Revenge fantasy films are attempting to make you see the world this way. That's right, they are the work of "the Devil."

You do not deserve contemptuous judgement for having spread evil, even if some part of you is doing it knowingly — and _especially_ if you are not ready to see it yet. Doing so would just drive it deeper into your mind. You've simply fallen prey to a very elaborate scheme; the most devious and insidious one possible. Its whole trick is to convince you that _other people_ are ultimately responsible for it, when they, too, are caught in its insane web. Compassion is simply the intention to pull people _out_ of this trap instead of shoving them _deeper in_. To be effective, it must be paired with _wisdom_, which is the knowledge of how to turn that intention into action. Such wisdom is the work of a lifetime, and is beyond the scope of this piece.

Said another way, _compassion is nothing but freedom from self-deception_, and in that way can never be the wrong motivation. It means having clear insight into the part of you that is every bit as fallible and corruptible as the worst among us. However much credit you wish to take for resisting it, you have to admit that tremendous amounts of grace were involved — and that you're probably _still_ nowhere near free of it. It is exactly this grace that you have to offer others.

Ironically, we eventually discover that our resistance to sharing this gift is because part of us isn't ready to accept it ourselves. This is the hardest part to talk about, because it transcends our usual perceptions of ourselves and the world. Everything you do to the world you ultimately do to yourself, because in a profound and surprising sense, [_you are the world_](unity.md). Realizing this is sometimes called _enlightenment_. Your desire to forsake others is ultimately an attempt to forsake yourself, because you're not ready to "come home" yet. These words might not mean much to you now, but part of you can always sense their truth.

Ultimately, the reason to show "other people" compassion is that it's the _only_ path to the more beautiful world your heart most secretly longs for[^Charles]. All else is illusion.

[^Charles] Yes, this is a nod to [Charles Eisenstein](https://www.amazon.com/Beautiful-Hearts-Possible-Sacred-Activism/dp/1583947248).

---

_Everything_ you do matters. It is your choice in each moment whether to withhold your inner Light or to shine it brightly. It is the responsibility of each one of us to discover what is preventing us from fully committing to the latter, and healing it. This is the greatest gift that we have to offer each other.

May we all find the courage to remember this. May we all find our way home.

> _Be kind, for everyone you meet is fighting a great battle._ —Author unknown

Why do wise people urge compassion for evildoers? Are they being naïve? Or could it be that they see something that we don't?

---

Consider the "bad people" — the greedy bankers, hypocritical CEOs, corrupt politicians, etc. — and how they're able to screw over others without apparent remorse. It really makes your blood boil, doesn't it? What has happened is that their minds have altered their perception of reality such that other people appear fundamentally inferior; subhuman, and thus acceptable to harm.

Do they know that they're doing this? Well, yes and no. Part of them knows _perfectly well_, of course — but that knowledge is carefully shielded from conscious self-reflection. All they hear are their own clever justifications. It is this state that has enabled _all the evil there ever was_ — and it has enabled our own misbehavior too, if we're honest. Every one of us has skirted our conscience before, pretending either that we couldn't hear it or that we didn't have to listen. Our examples may differ in degree, but not in kind.

This mind-state is infectious: simply by engaging in it, the "bad people" induce it in others. The dark part of their mind is trying to spread it, because the more normalized it becomes, the less they will have to confront it in themselves. This allows it to remain hidden. That part _wants_ you to hate them — because the darker your perception becomes, the more you will abandon your own deepest values, licensing yourself to behave in ways that you otherwise couldn't, and thereby spreading the infection yourself. But _you won't realize that you're doing this._ You will feel flawlessly convinced that you are "fighting evil" — and how could that ever be wrong?

You will even have evidence to prove it. Your darkness can indeed suppress other people's misbehavior — at least, their _public_ misbehavior, for a time. You will thus convince yourself that it "worked." But even if you manage to violently eradicate your enemies, doing so from this profoundly dark place will powerfully awaken the shadows of every person whose mind it touches, directly or indirectly, "friend" or "foe" — and a secret part of your mind will know that did this, because it is _doing it on purpose_. You have no idea how good your mind is at generating darkness while convincing you that it's somebody else's fault.

<p align="center" width="100%"><img width="300px" src="img/devil-vs-devil.png"></p>

In that darkened state, you're not just licensing yourself to hate "bad people," like you tell yourself. Your mind uses this liminal space to get away with all manner of hidden desires; desires that you may not even realize you have. For some people, it is about money or power, but for others it is (ironically) about looking and feeling like "good people" — people who therefore deserve to get away with _more_.

What happened is that your darkness heard the clarion call of theirs, recognizing it as a perfect opportunity to lure you into this state for its own sinister purposes, under the guise of "good." It is a kind of "secret handshake" between their shadow and yours. You have now become a silent beacon of the darkness yourself — but you won't (consciously) recognize it. You will be convinced that it is noble, and your ideology will support this belief.

What happens on the surface of our minds — our "good intentions" — ultimately matters far less than the covert activity taking place underneath; activity that most of us are normally unconscious of. It is this hidden activity that secretly runs the world.

<p align="center" width="100%"> <img width="300px" src="img/evil-above-world.png"> </p>

Contempt for other people (as opposed to their _beliefs_ or _behaviors_) is only ever a sign of self-deception. Any action taken from this state _will_ darken the world in some way that you will be unconscious of — except that it's not truly unconscious. **It is entirely accessible to consciousness, if only we look. The problem is that we choose not to look — for _precisely_ the same reason that the "bad people" never do:** beyond a certain point, it is too painful to confront what we have done. We are in too deep.

> _And no wonder, for even Satan masquerades as an angel of light. So it is not strange that his ministers also masquerade as ministers of righteousness._ —2 Corinthians 11:14-16

The more carefully you look, the more you discover the distinctive fingerprints of your own darkness imprinted on events distant in time and space; events that you previously never would have dreamed of having any connection to. All the darkness you have ever leaked into this world still remains, patiently waiting for you to clean it up — and you can identify it in the places that trigger you the most; the places that elicit _self-righteous outrage_. At the same time, these are where you will feel the most justified to layer on _more_ — and where your "allies" will support you in doing so. In fact, this is what most "alliance" really is: dividing us into categories of justifications for cruelty. This way, we never suspect our true enemy. It is the _perfect_ trap. In fact, it almost smells... designed.

From a certain perspective, the darkness appears sentient; even intelligent. It is that phenomenon that the ancients knew as the _Devil_[^devil]: a distributed malevolent entity manipulating all of our minds, communicating with itself beneath our conscious thresholds; subtly altering our perceptions, while convincing us that it doesn't exist — or that it doesn't exist within _us_, the righteous. Ironically, this is the _surest_ sign that our mind has been overtaken.

In more modern terms, it is the "evil global conspiracy": a secret cabal pulling all the strings, and yet hidden so well that nobody even suspects its existence — let alone that _part of their own mind is secretly in on it_. It is the _primordial_ evil conspiracy; the one to which all the rest owe their existence, and to which they ultimately filter up — and we are its minions.

<p align="center" width="100%"><img width="300px" src="./img/shared-devil.png"></p>

You can think of this as an allegory, but you can also learn to perceive it clearly and directly.

It is easy to sense its sinister presence in classically dark places – the archetypal "locker room" in which men dehumanize women, which later manifests in unspeakable conduct. With a little more sensitivity, you can detect it in the places where people gather to _hate_ men for doing this — and with more still, in the defensive reactions that cause men to believe that no such phenomenon could possibly exist simply because they are unable to see it yet. On and on it goes, effortlessly slithering through minds.

Countless similar patterns exist, for race, religion... you name it. Just visit any Facebook group and witness throngs of people being casually cruel to each other, believing that they're making things better — not realizing that they are simply feeding the Beast. We are all fighting a common enemy, and yet it has convinced us that we will overcome it by viciously fighting each other.

[^devil]: Though in some versions, he is just a _tempter_: he is checking whether you will abandon God (or your inner Light) but has no power (or even desire) to make you do so. I like this variant, because it makes it clear that that decision is entirely on us.

The elites may well be playing us off each other to take attention off of them, but the Devil is playing a _much_ bigger game — one in which even the elites are merely pawns. It tricks you into hating them specifically to draw your attention away from its presence in your own mind — the one place you actually have the power to dispel it, and from there, liberate other minds. It convinces you that your compassion isn't powerful enough to combat evil; that it is something soft and weak. This is a dark lie. Compassion is the _only_ thing capable of genuinely dispelling evil — because it is the only condition that is genuinely _free_ of it.

---

The classic image of the angel and devil on your shoulders is almost correct, except for two things. 

First, your devil doesn't just whisper obviously-bad ideas in your ear, like in the cartoons; no, it alters your very perception such that certain evils appear unmistakably righteous. It is extrinsic to your mind; a kind of parasite — and like all parasites, it can be evicted.

<p align="center" width="100%"><img width="300px" src="./img/parasite.png"></p>

Your angel, on the other hand, is intrinsic. It is a metaphor for that place in your mind that the devil can never touch; the very deepest part of you; your fundamental goodness. It is what remains when all self-deception evaporates.

Your angel can see perfectly well that other people's minds have merely been hijacked by their devils; that it's not intrinsic to their nature. Even those who have _knowingly invited it in_ — and make no mistake, some people have — deserve to be freed of it. Contempt is nothing but the violent urge to shove them _deeper into_ its clutches, where we will feel even more licensed to be cruel, in a vicious feedback loop.

That is why your devil's cleverest trick is to make _other people's_ devils appear intrinsic. Think about the "bad people." Don't they seem _fundamentally morally defective,_ and thus entirely unlike us? By definition such people cannot be helped; they can only be punished or subdued. The truth is, you don't actually know who can be freed and who cannot — and the only reason to believe they cannot is to make harming them feel righteous. It is a trap. Compassion is simply freedom from this pernicious illusion.

---

> _For so long as the root of wickedness is hidden, it is strong. But when it is recognized, it is dissolved. When it is revealed, it perishes. ... It is powerful because we have not recognized it._ — The Gospel of Philip

Compassion does not have to be nice. In fact, the more ensnared by darkness a person is, the more fierce — or even _violent_ — compassion for them must be. It can look like mocking and shaming, or even _apparent_ contempt or hatred. Almost nothing is off-limits. At the same time, the easier it becomes to lie to yourself about your true intentions: are you being of genuine service to the world, or using it as cover for something much darker?

It is precisely this difficulty that the Devil uses to sneak into your mind undetected. It knows that you will use the _content_ of your thoughts — "oh, I'm just protecting the innocent" — to determine the morality of your actions, and so it generates exceedingly clever justifications that it knows will fool you. The more you listen to it, the smarter it gets, until even thoughts that once would have struck you as obviously-evil now seem unmistakably good. That is why you must learn to see _past_ your thoughts, and hear a voice that is much deeper.

[//]: # (This is why "the road to hell is paved with good intentions": because our conscious intentions are rarely our true intentions.)

<p align="center" width="100%"><img width="300px" src="./img/half-evil.png"></p>

Part of you _always_ knows which voice you are listening to, and everything comes down to becoming conscious of it. I can't tell you how to do it, but luckily, the deepest part of you already knows. There are also a few hints that can be helpful.

If there is even a _trace_ of malice, contempt (for the person), or self-righteousness, then it is *always* your shadow. Same with seeing the world in black and white: dividing people into the _intrinsically_ good and bad; victims and perpetrators; those who deserve your compassion and those who deserve your hatred[^films]. It will make a big show of being sweet to the victims and cruel to the perpetrators, as a way of keeping you in the dark about what is really going. You will not recognize it in yourself, but others very much can (if only subconsciously). Unless they are relatively free of the darkness themselvdes, they will feel contempt for you, thus "unknowingly" perpetuating the cycle.

---

Your true enemy is not other people, but the darkness that has infected all of our minds. Everything comes down to seeing how it has hijacked both ourselves and others, and recognizing what help we can offer to free them of it — whether that requires patience and understanding, or wrath and ferocity. The more you become free yourself, the more you recognize what is needed in others.

[^films]: Revenge fantasy films are attempting to make you see the world this way. That's right, they are the work of "the Devil."

You do not deserve contemptuous judgement for having spread evil, even if some part of you is doing it knowingly — and _especially_ if you are not ready to see it yet. Doing so would just drive it deeper into your mind. You've simply fallen prey to a very elaborate scheme; the most devious and insidious one possible. Its whole trick is to convince you that _other people_ are ultimately responsible for it, when they, too, are caught in its insane web. Compassion is simply the intention to pull people _out_ of this trap instead of shoving them _deeper in_. To be effective, it must be paired with _wisdom_, which is the knowledge of how to turn that intention into action. Such wisdom is the work of a lifetime, and is beyond the scope of this piece.

Said another way, _compassion is nothing but freedom from self-deception_, and in that way can never be the wrong motivation. It means having clear insight into the part of you that is every bit as fallible and corruptible as the worst among us. However much credit you wish to take for resisting it, you have to admit that tremendous amounts of grace were involved — and that you're probably _still_ nowhere near free of it. It is exactly this grace that you have to offer others.

Ironically, we eventually discover that our resistance to sharing this gift is because part of us isn't ready to accept it ourselves. This is the hardest part to talk about, because it transcends our usual perceptions of ourselves and the world. Everything you do to the world you ultimately do to yourself, because in a profound and surprising sense, [_you are the world_](unity.md). Realizing this is sometimes called _enlightenment_. Your desire to forsake others is ultimately an attempt to forsake yourself, because you're not ready to "come home" yet. These words might not mean much to you now, but part of you can always sense their truth.

Ultimately, the reason to show "other people" compassion is that it's the _only_ path to the more beautiful world your heart most secretly longs for[^Charles]. All else is illusion.

[^Charles] Yes, this is a nod to [Charles Eisenstein](https://www.amazon.com/Beautiful-Hearts-Possible-Sacred-Activism/dp/1583947248).

---

_Everything_ you do matters. It is your choice in each moment whether to withhold your inner Light or to shine it brightly. It is the responsibility of each one of us to discover what is preventing us from fully committing to the latter, and healing it. This is the greatest gift that we have to offer each other.

May we all find the courage to remember this. May we all find our way home.

We think that hating "bad people" is a sign of the good within us, but it's actually a sign of something _much darker_.

People are only able to cause willful harm due to a kind of self-deception: part of them knows _perfectly well_ that they are doing wrong, but that knowledge is carefully shielded from conscious self-reflection. All they hear are their own clever justifications. It is this mechanism that has enabled _all the evil there ever was_ — and it has enabled our own misbehavior too, if we're honest. We have all skirted our conscience before, pretending either that we couldn't hear it or that we didn't have to listen.

When we encounter a person in this state, we often don't recognize a fellow human under the sway of a powerful illusion; one that we ourselves are all-too-susceptible to. No, we see them as _fundamentally defective_ and thus worthy of only contempt. Such a person by definition cannot be helped; they can only be subdued or punished — and it is our righteous duty to do so. This is what we tell ourselves, but it is an insidious lie.

<p align="center" width="100%"><img width="300px" src="./img/half-evil.png"></p>

---

A mind that is free of self-deception is incapable of feeling contempt. It sees that although people have indeed _chosen_ to follow their darkness in a sense, that choice is ultimately rooted in a kind of confusion — one that contempt is secretly designed to _reinforce_. We mock and shame our enemies specifically so that they will dig in their heels, enabling us to escalate while plausibly blaming it on them.

We are in fact _choosing_ to do this in one sense, but it's ultimately rooted in a kind of confusion. **_Any_ time we choose our ideologies or agendas over our kindness, we are acting from confusion**. Such confusion is contagious: simply by engaging in it, we induce it in others — such as our aforementioned enemies. Our mind is secretly giving them permission to enter the same shadowy state that we have licensed in ourselves. This is why "the road to hell is paved with good intentions": our _conscious_ intentions are rarely our _true_ intentions.

> _And no wonder, for even Satan masquerades as an angel of light. So it is not strange that his ministers also masquerade as ministers of righteousness._ —2 Corinthians 11:14-16

This is the secret mechanism by which nearly all evil spreads, nearly undetected. We all have places where we lie to ourselves about our real motivations, in subtle and not-so-subtle ways — and by doing so, we covertly authorize others to do the same. It is a kind of secret handshake; a kind of deal with the Devil — one that you can learn to perceive. We act shocked and dismayed at its outcome — but only so that we can use it as justification to _intensify_ the process.

<p align="center" width="100%"> <img width="300px" src="img/evil-above-world.png"> </p>


We're not doing this because we are _evil_, per se — although that is what evil ultimately boils down to: the willingness to look away. We're doing it because there are aspects of our mind that feel that they aren't getting what they need, and must provide cover to get it without being judged. All of this dark activity serves to provide that cover. The darker the state of the world, the easier it becomes to look away from what our own minds are doing. But we must never admit that we're doing this; there must always be "bad people" to blame.

From a certain perspective, this shadowy activity appears sentient; even intelligent. The darkness in our minds is _coordinating_; each provoking the other while carefully hiding itself from us, its hosts. In fact, they aren't truly separate: they behave more like appendages of a _distributed malevolent entity_, cleverly manipulating all of humanity from within the dark crevices of our own minds; the places where we dare not look. The _Devil_ is indeed a good description — and it is as "real" as anything you can touch.

In more modern terms, it is the _evil global conspiracy_ — that secret cabal responsible for all the world's ills, yet whose full membership remains forever elusive. It is the _primordial_ evil conspiracy, to which all the rest owe their existence, and to which they ultimately filter up. All the conspiracies you can consciously identify "out there" ultimately originate from this shared hidden aspect of mind. They feel "shadowy" because they are outer reflections of our collective unwillingness to look closely "in here."

<p align="center" width="100%"><img width="300px" src="./img/shared-devil.png"></p>

---

The whole division between "bad people" and "good people"; those "in on it" and those not, is the most devious sham. That distinction doesn't exist in reality, but only in your mind, and only to provide your conscious mind with a bright line beyond which you need not question your intentions. Everyone on "this" side of the line must be treated with cloying sweetness — or what we confuse for "compassion" — and everyone on "that" side with cruelty, to prove to ourselves and the world which team we are on.

To be clear: there are indeed people so thoroughly mired in darkness that "confusion" doesn't begin to describe the depths of their depravity. All this means is that their darkness is _especially_ good at seducing us into our shadows, where we will gleefully abandon our deepest integrity, not realizing what we've done until it is far too late. That darkness is not intrinsic to even their minds, and malice for them is _especially_ "evil." They represent the jackpot: an avenue to unleash our own darkness with impunity.

The more carefully we look, the more we discover the distinctive fingerprints of our own darkness imprinted on events distant in time and space; events that we previously never would have dreamed of having any connection to, let alone complicity in. All the darkness we have ever leaked into this world still remains, patiently waiting for us to clean it up — and we can identify it in the places that trigger us the most; those that elicit _self-righteous outrage_. At the same time, these are where we feel the most justified in layering on more — and where our "allies" support us most in doing so.

<p align="center" width="100%"><img width="300px" src="./img/parasite.png"></p>

The _only_ weapon we have against the darkness is our inner Light. **Our thoughts, ideologies, and agendas cannot tell us whether we are acting with integrity,** because those can all be freely manipulated by our darkness. Everything comes down to our deep honesty about whether we are acting from our profound Love for all of reality or merely our ideas about "right" and "wrong." This is a Love that excludes nothing and forsakes no-one — but also does not shy away from being fierce (or even violent) when the situation warrants it. This is true compassion, and it has nothing to do with being "nice."

This Love is what you ultimately _are_ — what _everyone_ ultimately is. This may sound "woo-woo," but it is something you can learn to perceive directly. You _are_ everyone and everything, in a profound and surprising sense, just pretending that you're not. "Evil" is ultimately nothing but our attempt to avoid seeing this, because we are not ready to come Home yet. People cannot be forced to see it, and _trying_ to is madness; a reliable indicator that you yourself have forgotten. But the more you remember it yourself, the more your behavior serves as a reminder to "others."

Such behavior need not look anything like "compassion" or "love" in the conventional sense. It may be fierce or violent, perhaps looking like mocking and shaming. It may require _apparent_ contempt. But it arises from a very different source, and has a very different impact on all minds involved, whether the people consciously realize it or not. This is the secret mechanism by which the _Light_ spreads.

At its fiercest, the Light can look almost indistinguishable from darkness — _almost._ Consciously, they can be hard to tell apart, but your subconscious always knows. Our darkness relies on this apparent difficulty to sneak in, but the most humbling discovery is that this difficulty was only ever apparent. It was never truly "subconscious": it was always perfectly accessible to consciousness, if only we had looked. But _we chose not to look._ Thus, we never had a leg to stand on when judging others for making the same choice.

I wish I had a nugget of wisdom to share about real, practical ways to put this knowledge to use. Alas, I am a mere fledgling myself. All I know is that I wish to stop playing the dark game that we have inherited, and exchange it for a more beautiful one. I only hope that you will join me — and that you will hold my feet to the fire when I pretend to forget myself.

We mock and shame our enemies specifically so that they will dig in their heels, enabling us to escalate while plausibly blaming it on them.

We are in fact _choosing_ to do this in one sense, but it's ultimately rooted in a kind of confusion. **_Any_ time we choose our ideologies or agendas over our kindness, we are acting from confusion**. It is contagious: simply by engaging in it, we induce it in others — such as our aforementioned enemies. Our mind is giving them secret permission to enter the same shadowy state that we have licensed ourselves to be in.

The way this works is _insanely_ clever: by pretending to be _fundamentally superior_ to others — contempt — we are telegraphing our own self-deception in a way that is subconsciously obvious to them but hidden from us. This provokes the same pattern in them, but gives our minds plausible deniability, so that we will never have to confront what we have done. It is a kind of willful ignorance.

> _And no wonder, for even Satan masquerades as an angel of light. So it is not strange that his ministers also masquerade as ministers of righteousness._ —2 Corinthians 11:14-16

This is the hidden mechanism by which nearly all evil spreads, undetected. We all have places in our lives where we lie to ourselves about our true motivations, in subtle and not-so-subtle ways — and by doing so, we covertly authorize others to do the same. It is a kind of secret handshake — one that you can learn to perceive. Your mind enters the shadow space without alerting you, to invite others in without alerting them. This way, none of us have to face what we are really doing.

<p align="center" width="100%"> <img width="300px" src="img/evil-above-world.png"> </p>

We're not doing this because we are _evil_, per se — although that is what evil ultimately boils down to: the willingness to look away. We're doing it because there are aspects of our mind that feel that they aren't getting what they need, and must provide cover to get it without being judged. We generate all this dark activity to provide that cover — not just for us, but for everyone; "allies" and "enemies" alike. The darker the state of the world, the easier it becomes to look away from what our own minds are doing. But who are we really serving?

From a certain perspective, this shadowy activity appears sentient; even intelligent. The darkness in our minds is _coordinating_; provoking one another while carefully hiding themselves from us, its hosts. In fact, they aren't truly separate: they behave more like appendages of a _distributed malevolent entity_, manipulating all of humanity from within the dark crevices of our own minds; the places where we dare not look. It keeps our attention perpetually fixated outward, on the evil "out there," to prevent us from looking "in here" — the one place where we have direct power over it. It is what some cultures know as the _Devil_ — and it is as "real" as anything you can touch.

<p align="center" width="100%"><img width="300px" src="./img/shared-devil.png"></p>

In more modern terms, it is the _evil global conspiracy_ — that secret cabal responsible for all the world's ills, yet whose full membership remains forever elusive. It is the _primordial_ evil conspiracy, to which all the rest owe their existence, and to which they ultimately filter up. All the conspiracies you can consciously identify "out there" ultimately originate from this shared hidden aspect of mind. They feel "shadowy" because they are outer reflections of our collective unconscious.

It is said that the elites are playing us off one another to take attention away from themselves — but the Devil is playing a _much_ bigger game; one in which even the elites are merely pawns. It controls our perception and models of reality to such a degree that we cannot even _fathom_ its existence. We feel that the dark state of our world must be due to individuals who are completely unlike us, and whose violent elimination would bring peace — because _we_ would never let things get this way. This is the darkest lie of all.

The whole division between "bad people" and "good people"; those "in on it" and those not, is a devious sham. That distinction doesn't exist in reality, but only in your mind, and only to provide it with a bright line beyond which you need not look too carefully at your mind's hidden intent. Everyone on "this" side of the line gets treated with cloying sweetness — or what we confuse for "compassion" — and everyone on "that" side with cruelty, to prove to ourselves and the world which team we are on, eliminating the need to look.

To be clear: there are indeed people so thoroughly mired in darkness that "confusion" doesn't begin to describe the depths of their depravity. All this means is that their darkness is _especially_ good at seducing us into our shadows, where we will gleefully abandon our deepest integrity, not realizing what we've done until it is far too late. That darkness is not intrinsic to even their minds, and malice for them is _especially_ "evil." They represent the jackpot: an avenue to unleash our own darkness with impunity.

If we look carefully, we can discover the distinctive fingerprints of our own darkness imprinted on events distant in time and space; events that we previously never would have dreamed of having any connection to, let alone complicity in. All the darkness we have ever leaked into this world still remains, patiently waiting for us to clean it up — and we can identify it in the places that trigger us the most; those that elicit _self-righteous outrage_. At the same time, these are where we feel the most justified in layering on more — and where our "allies" support us most in doing so.

The more your own darkness is dispelled, the more you see the sense in which nobody could ultimately want to be possessed by theirs — even those who have convinced themselves and the world that they do. It is a kind of Stockholm syndrome, and hating them is just taking the bait of their captor — humanity's ultimate foe.

The _only_ weapon we have against the darkness is our Light. **Our thoughts, ideologies, and agendas cannot tell us whether we are acting with integrity,** because those are freely manipulated by our darkness. Everything comes down to our deep honesty about whether we are acting from our profound Love for all of reality or merely our ideas about "right" and "wrong." This is a Love that excludes nothing and forsakes no-one — but also does not shy away from being fierce (or even violent) when the situation warrants it. This is true compassion, and it has nothing to do with being nice.

This Love is what you ultimately _are_ — what _everyone_ ultimately is. This may sound "woo-woo," but it is something you can learn to perceive directly. You _are_ everyone and everything, in a profound and surprising sense, just pretending that you're not. It is impossible to harm another without ultimately harming yourself, and your desire to forsake others is ultimately an attempt to forsake yourself, because you're not ready to come Home yet.

All self-deception is ultimately rooted in ignorance of this profound truth; in an innocent misperception. Defeating evil therefore comes down to healing it. People cannot be forced to see it, and _trying_ to is madness; a reliable indicator that we ourselves have forgotten. But the more we remember it ourselves, the more our behavior serves as a reminder to them.

**Such behavior need not look anything like "compassion" or "love" in the conventional sense.** It may be fierce or violent, perhaps even looking like mocking and shaming. It may require _apparent_ contempt. But it arises from a very different source, and has a very different impact on all minds involved, whether the people consciously realize it or not. This is the secret mechanism by which the _Light_ spreads.

At its fiercest, the Light can look almost indistinguishable from darkness — _almost._ Consciously, they can be hard to tell apart, but our subconscious always knows. Our darkness relies on this apparent difficulty to sneak in. But the most humbling discovery is that it was never actually difficult at all. It was never truly "subconscious": it was always perfectly accessible to consciousness, if only we had looked. But _we chose not to look._ We can remember to look — and to thereby help others do the same.

I wish I had a nugget of wisdom to share about real, practical ways to put this knowledge to use. Alas, I am a mere fledgling myself. All I know is that I wish to stop playing the dark game that we have inherited, and exchange it for a more beautiful one. I only hope that you will join me — and that you will hold my feet to the fire when I pretend to forget myself.

We think that hating "bad people" is a sign of the good within us, but it's actually a sign of something _much darker_.

People are only able to cause willful harm due to a kind of self-deception: part of them knows _perfectly well_ that they are doing wrong, but that knowledge is carefully shielded from conscious self-reflection. All they hear are their own clever justifications. It is this secret mechanism that has enabled _all the evil there ever was_ — and it has enabled our own misbehavior too, if we're honest. We have all skirted our conscience before, pretending either that we couldn't hear it or that we didn't have to listen.

When we encounter a person in this state, we often don't recognize a fellow human under the sway of a powerful illusion; one that we ourselves are all-too-susceptible to. No, we see them as _fundamentally defective_ and thus worthy of only contempt. Such a person cannot be helped, by definition; they can only be subdued or punished — and it is our righteous duty to do so. This is what we tell ourselves, but it is an insidious lie.

Why do wise people urge compassion for evildoers? Are they being naïve? Or could it be that they see something that we don't?

---

Every one of us has had the experience of skirting our conscience — behaving in a way that goes against our deepest values, but that we convince ourselves is okay anyway.

Maybe we've helped ourselves to "a little extra" at the expense of a company, convinced that we're only harming its wealthy (and greedy) owners. Maybe it turns out that the owners weren't so wealthy after all, or that our cumulative behavior harmed many other people indirectly. But our minds found an excuse for those too — or else entirely blocked that knowledge from conscious awareness.

Or perhaps we were a little bit nasty to someone, convinced that they deserved it — having no deep insight into the true source of their misbehavior, and being unable to admit that we just compounded their difficulties in life. We can't see that a tiny part of them was actually trying to be better, and that our casual nastiness was the final straw that made them lose faith in humanity. To hide this, we convince ourselves that _no_ part of them was trying; that they are _fundamentally morally defective,_ and thus beyond help. But it doesn't feel like we're _convincing_ ourselves; it simply feels like "the truth."

<p align="center" width="100%"><img width="300px" src="./img/half-evil.png"></p>

As hard as it is to admit that we do this, much harder still is confronting the full impact of our behavior. All the darkness in the world is intimately connected. Every act of unkindness we commit eventually propagates into the Whole, lowering the threshold for darkness to manifest elsewhere. Each act of self-deception makes it more likely that genuine atrocities will be committed by someone, somewhere — atrocities for which we will not only feel absolutely no complicity, but which will actually trigger _self-righteous outrage_, thus inducing us to compound the problem. And part of us knows all of this.

This is the secret mechanism by which evil spreads without anyone having to take responsibility. Each one of us is only able to see the self-deception in others, provoking us to violently combat it, thus reinforcing it while flawlessly convinced that we are "helping." When you look into the eyes of a person and see "evil," what you are actually seeing is a locus where all this dark activity has accumulated especially intensely — and a seductive invitation to pile on _more_ in a way that is somehow still socially acceptable.

<p align="center" width="100%"> <img width="300px" src="img/evil-above-world.png"> </p>

You would think that the "bad people" are (or _should_ be) especially aware of their evil, but the only reason they can do it in the first place is because their self-deception is especially good at hiding it from conscious self-awareness — and our attempts to violently evict it are secretly attempts to _reinforce_ it in a way that neither we nor anyone else will ever suspect. This is why our political opponents just dig in their heels when we mock and shame them: part of us _needs_ this outcome, so that we and they can continue to act as covers for each other's darkness.

Our darkness can indeed suppress other people's misbehavior — at least, in public, and for a time. We can thus easily convince ourselves that it "worked" — but only because we choose not to look too closely at the deeper effects of our behavior. They are always there to see, if only we choose to look.

The one weapon we have against the darkness is our Light. You could also call it kindness, or compassion.

**Compassion has nothing to do with being nice.** It is simply about being free of self-deception, so that our attempts to fight evil do not have the "unintended" consequence of creating more. From here, contempt (for people) is impossible, because you clearly see the sense in which the Darkness is impersonal, despite people obviously having _chosen_ it in some sense. Its greatest trick is to make you hate them for having done so, not realizing that this hatred is _you_ choosing the darkness yourself — and that others can subconsciously tell that you're making this choice, which licenses them to do it more, which part of you knows but cannot admit, which is what makes the choice evil in the first place.

That's a lot to unpack, so let's try again.

Contempt for "bad people" is secretly an attempt to create _more_ darkness in a way that appears righteous, to provide cover for our own self-deception. The same is true of malice and self-righteousness. It is _extremely hard_ to admit this, but other people can always tell, if only subconsciously. It thereby acts as a "secret handshake" that licenses them to do it _more_, even as we pretend to be fighting it. 

In other words, our unwillingness to confront our own darkness is what perpetuates it in the world. Indeed, it is this very unwillingness that makes it "dark" in the first place. **Evil is ultimately nothing but _the willingness to look away_ — not just from the darkness "out there," but the darkness "in here."**

But what is it that we're looking away _from_, exactly? To say that "evil is the willingness to look away from evil" would be circular.

---

There is a profound and astonishing sense in which we **are** everyone and everything. Realizing this in its entirety is known as _enlightenment_ (en-_Light_-enment), and is indeed a lofty goal — but all of us can sense it at all times, to some degree. **You are the Light.** It is why we thank other people even for acts of kindness that don't benefit us directly. We intuit that what happens to any part ultimately happens to the whole. Evil is nothing but our inability (or unwillingness) to see this.

This is why contempt is intrinsically self-deceptive: it is the pretense that we are _fundamentally better_ than others, which the deepest part of us realizes is a sham — and which they can sense too, no matter how "evil" they are. It is this common knowledge (in the [technical sense](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/common-knowledge/): that _they know that we know that they know..._) that permits evil to spread in the way described above — and ironically, it is rooted in our fundamental unity.

<p align="center" width="100%"><img width="300px" src="./img/good-vs-bad.png"></p>

Looking down on others is looking down on ourselves; harming them ultimately harms us; and forsaking them is secretly a desire to forsake ourselves, because we're not ready to come Home yet. Until we see this, literally everything we do to "fight evil" secretly perpetuates it. It is only through compassion — freedom from self-deception — that we discover how to fight evil in a way that actually works.

**Such behavior need not look anything like "compassion" in the conventional sense.** It may be fierce or violent, perhaps even manifesting as mocking and shaming. It may require _apparent_ contempt. But it arises from a very different source, and has a very different impact on all minds involved. Its deep integrity prevents the darkness in others from finding easy justification for itself. **This is the secret mechanism by which the _Light_ spreads.**

At its fiercest, the Light can look almost indistinguishable from darkness — _almost._ They can be hard to tell apart, but our subconscious always knows. It is this apparent difficulty that allows our darkness to sneak in. But the most humbling discovery is that it was never truly "subconscious": it was always perfectly accessible to consciousness, if only we had looked. Again, _we chose not to look._ We chose our agendas and ideologies instead, confusing them for our Love.

This is the most painful realization, but also the most liberating: all that is required to redeem ourselves is to _choose to look_. Doing this even once, we see that we never truly _wanted_ to look away; that we never _could_ want such a thing — and that nobody else could either, if only they knew. Our commitment to Look creates ripples throughout reality, impacting it in ways that we may never fully appreciate. This is the greatest gift we have to offer the world.

I wish I could leave you with some wisdom about real, practical ways to put this knowledge to use. Alas, such wisdom is the work of a lifetime, and I am a mere fledgling myself. All I know is that I wish to stop playing the dark game that we have inherited, and to exchange it for a more beautiful one. I only hope that you will join me — and that you will hold my feet to the fire with unflinching kindness when I (pretend to) forget.

Why do wise people urge compassion for evildoers? Are they being naïve? Or could it be that they see something that we don't?

---

Every one of us has had the experience of skirting our conscience — behaving in a way that goes against our deepest values, but that we convince ourselves is okay anyway.

Maybe we've helped ourselves to "a little extra" at the expense of a company, convinced that we're only harming its wealthy (and greedy) owners. Maybe it turns out that the owners weren't so wealthy after all, or that our behavior harmed many other people indirectly. But our minds found an excuse for those too — or else blocked that knowledge entirely from conscious awareness, to preserve our self-image as the victims.

Or perhaps we were a little bit nasty to someone, convinced that they deserved it — having no deep insight into the true source of their misbehavior, and unable to admit that we just compounded their difficulties in life. We can't see that a tiny part of them was actually _trying_, and that our casual cruelty was the final straw that made them lose faith in humanity. To hide this, we must convince ourselves that _no_ part of them was trying; that they are _fundamentally morally defective,_ and thus beyond help. But it doesn't feel like we're _convincing_ ourselves; it simply feels like "the truth." It _must_ feel that way.

<p align="center" width="100%"><img width="300px" src="./img/half-evil.png"></p>

It is very painful to admit that we're doing this, but it gets worse. If you look carefully enough, you'll find that all the darkness in the world is intimately connected. Every act of unkindness we commit propagates into the Whole, lowering the threshold for darkness to manifest elsewhere. Every act of self-deception makes it more likely that genuine atrocities will be committed by someone, somewhere — atrocities for which we will not only feel absolutely no complicity, but which will actually trigger _self-righteous outrage_, thus inciting us to compound the problem.

This is the secret mechanism by which evil spreads without anyone realizing their part. Each one of us is only able to see the self-deception in others, provoking us to violently combat it, reinforcing it while certain that we are fighting it.

When you look into the eyes of a person and see "evil," what you are actually seeing is a place where all this dark activity has accumulated especially intensely — and a seductive invitation to pile on _more_, in a way that nobody would dare judge us for. Our culture's cumulative self-deception _necessitates_ the existence of such people — and secretly "benefits" from it, because they act as scapegoats to draw our attention away from all the ways in which we support them.

<p align="center" width="100%"> <img width="300px" src="img/evil-above-world.png"> </p>

You would think that the "bad people" are (or _should_ be) especially aware of their evil, but the only reason they can do it in the first place is because their self-deception is especially good at hiding it from conscious self-awareness — and our attempts to violently evict it are secretly attempts to _reinforce_ it in a way that neither we nor anyone else will ever suspect. This is why our political opponents dig in their heels when we mock and shame them: part of us _needs_ them to, so that we and they can continue to act as covers for each other's self-deception.

To be clear: our darkness can indeed suppress other people's misbehavior — at least, in public, and for a time. We can thus easily convince ourselves that it "worked" — but only because we choose not to look too closely at the full implications of our behavior.

---

> _And no wonder, for even Satan masquerades as an angel of light. So it is not strange that his ministers also masquerade as ministers of righteousness._ —2 Corinthians 11:14-16

From a certain perspective, this cumulative shadowy activity appears sentient; even intelligent. In fact, your darkness and mine aren't truly separate: they behave more like appendages of a _distributed malevolent entity_, manipulating all of humanity from within the dark crevices of our own minds; the places where we dare not look.

It is what some cultures know as the _Devil_ — and it is as "real" as anything you can touch. By keeping our attention perpetually fixated outward, it prevents us from looking too closely "in here" — the one place where we have direct power over it. Its greatest trick is to make you perceive other people's evil as being _intrinsic_ to their minds. **This is the moment of truth. By accepting this misperception, you are choosing to enter your own shadow.** Through repeated acceptance, others increasingly identify _your_ evil as intrinsic. It is an _insanely_ clever ploy — and it is working.

<p align="center" width="100%"><img width="300px" src="./img/shared-devil.png"></p>

In more modern terms, it is the _evil global conspiracy_ — that secret cabal responsible for all the world's ills, yet whose full membership remains forever elusive. It is the _primordial_ evil conspiracy; the one to which all the rest owe their existence, and to which they ultimately filter up. Every single conspiracy you can identify "out there" is rooted in this shared hidden aspect of mind. They feel "shadowy" because they are outer reflections of our collective unconscious. To believe that we have pinned it down externally is to have fallen into its most basic trap.

The elites may well be playing us off each other to take attention away from themselves — but the Devil is playing a _much_ bigger game; one in which even the elites are merely pawns. It controls our perception and models of reality so completely that we can hardly even fathom its existence. We feel that the dark state of our world must be due to individuals who are fundamentally unlike us, and whose violent elimination would bring peace. It is astonishing that we never notice where these dark thoughts actually originate from, and what master they secretly serve.

<p align="center" width="100%"><img width="300px" src="./img/parasite.png"></p>

It certainly feels like there are people who have _chosen_ the Darkness in a way that we have not — and in a way, this is true. But in every case, there is an aspect of their mind that doesn't yet know that they have done this — just as there is within ourselves. In a sense, the whole fight against evil comes down to _recruiting_ that part. Everything else just causes _more._

---

This is called _compassion_ or _kindness_ — **and it has nothing to do with being nice.**

It is simply about being free of self-deception, so that our attempts to fight evil do not have the "unintended" consequence of creating more. From here, contempt (for people) is impossible, because you clearly see the sense in which the Darkness is impersonal, despite people having _chosen_ it in some sense. Hating them for it is always a trap — and now you see why. This is hard to communicate, but we will try.

The secret purpose of contempt is to telegraph our own inner darkness to others, while convincing us that we're doing no such thing. This acts as a kind of "secret handshake" with their darkness, which in turn convinces their conscious minds that we aren't so innocent after all, thus alleviating any remaining compunction they might still have. But since we don't know that we're doing this, we take this as confirmation that _they_ are evil, which licenses escalation. Consciously, we act dismayed by their recalcitrance, but our darkness is secretly rejoicing in accomplishing its goal. 

All of this only works because part of us _knows_ that we're doing it, and part of them knows that we know, etc. — but at the same time, we both _don't_ know. This is also how _malice_ and _self-righteousness_ work. They are always tricks.

Our unwillingness to confront our own darkness is what perpetuates it in the world. Indeed, it is this very unwillingness that makes it "dark" in the first place. **Evil is ultimately nothing but _the willingness to look away_ — not just from the darkness "out there," but from the darkness "in here."**

But what is it that we're looking away _from_, exactly? To say that "evil is the willingness to look away from evil" would be circular.

---

There is a profound and astonishing sense in which we **are** everyone and everything. Realizing this in its entirety is known as _enlightenment_ (en-_Light_-enment), and is indeed a lofty goal — but all of us can sense it at all times, to one degree or another. It is why we thank other people even for acts of kindness that don't benefit us directly. We intuit that what happens to any part ultimately happens to the whole. **You are the Light** — and so is everyone else. This may sound mystical or "woo woo," but it can be known directly and concretely. All self-deception — and thus all evil — ultimately boils down to our inability (or unwillingness) to see this.

This is why contempt is intrinsically self-deceptive: it is the pretense that we are _fundamentally better_ than others, which the deepest part of us realizes is a sham — and which they can sense too, no matter how "evil" they are. It is the existence of this common knowledge (in the [technical sense](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/common-knowledge/): that _they know that we know that they know..._) that permits evil to spread in the way described above. So ironically, evil ultimately depends on our fundamental unity.

<p align="center" width="100%"><img width="300px" src="./img/good-vs-bad.png"></p>

It is still unfortunately common for people to gather and vibe over how we "get away with" things, but the key insight is that this is an illusion: we never "get away" with anything at all. Harming others always ultimately harms us; looking down on them is looking down on ourselves; and forsaking them is secretly a desire to forsake ourselves, because we're not ready to come Home yet. Until we see this, literally everything we do to "fight evil" secretly perpetuates it. It is only through compassion — freedom from self-deception — that we discover how to fight evil in a way that actually works.

**Such behavior need not look anything like "compassion" in the conventional sense.** It may require contempt for their _behaviors_ or _beliefs_.  It may be fierce or violent, perhaps even manifesting as mocking or shaming. But it arises from a very different source, and has a very different impact on all minds involved. Its profound integrity prevents the darkness in others from finding easy justification for itself. **This is the secret mechanism by which the _Light_ spreads.**

Again, _we chose not to look._ **We chose our agendas and ideologies over our kindness.** This was our fatal mistake.

This is a painful realization, but also the most liberating: all that is required to redeem ourselves is to _choose to look_. Doing this even once, we discover that we never truly _wanted_ to look away; that we never _could_ want such a thing — and that nobody else could either, if only they knew. This firm commitment to Look ripples throughout reality, tilling the ground for others to follow suit in their own time. This is the greatest gift we have to offer the world, and it doesn't require any special circumstances. Every moment is a fresh opportunity to re-establish our deepest integrity.

Why do wise people urge compassion for evildoers? Are they being naïve? Or could it be that they see something that we don't?

---

The vast majority of what we do to "fight evil" is actually no such thing. It is the darkness in our minds _pretending_ to combat the darkness "out there." But darkness never _actually_ fights itself: it is only ever on its own team. 

Every one of us has had the experience of skirting our conscience before — behaving in a way that goes against our deepest values, but that we convince ourselves is okay. Part of us knows _perfectly well_ that what we are doing is wrong, but that knowledge is carefully shielded from conscious self-reflection: it is "kept dark."

Maybe we've helped ourselves to "a little extra" at the expense of a company, convinced that we're only harming its wealthy (and greedy) owners. Maybe it turns out that the owners weren't so wealthy after all, or that our behavior subtly harmed many other people indirectly. But our minds found an excuse for those too — or else blocked that knowledge entirely from conscious awareness, so as not to threaten our story of good and bad.

Or perhaps we were a little bit nasty to someone, convinced that they deserved it — having no deep insight into the true source of their misbehavior, and unable to admit that we just compounded their difficulties in life. We can't see that a tiny part of them was actually _trying_, and that our casual cruelty was the final straw. To hide this, we convince ourselves that _no_ part of them was trying; that they are _fundamentally morally defective,_ and thus beyond help. But it doesn't feel like we're _convincing_ ourselves; it simply feels like "the truth." We have no idea how good our minds are at crafting our reality to match our needs.

<p align="center" width="100%"><img width="300px" src="./img/half-evil.png"></p>

All the darkness in the world is intimately connected. Every act of unkindness propagates into the Whole, lowering the threshold for darkness to manifest elsewhere. Every act of self-deception makes it more likely that genuine atrocities will be committed by someone, somewhere — atrocities for which we will not only feel absolutely no complicity, but which will actually trigger _self-righteous outrage_, inciting us to compound the problem.

This is the secret mechanism by which evil spreads without anyone recognizing their role. Each one of us is only able to see the self-deception in others, provoking us to violently attack it, thereby reinforcing it while feeling flawlessly certain that we are "helping." It is an _impossibly_ clever trick. 

The reason that we cannot defeat evil is that we refuse to see its true nature. A deep part of us knows that to fully expose it "out there" would also expose it "in here" — and we are not ready for that just yet.

From a certain perspective, the darkness appears sentient; even intelligent. Yours triggers mine, which triggers yours, etc., almost as though they are _allied_. In fact, if you look closely, you'll see that your darkness and mine aren't truly separate: they behave more like appendages of a _distributed malevolent entity_, manipulating all of humanity from within the dark crevices of our own minds; the places where we dare not look.

Its greatest trick is to make you perceive other people's evil as being _intrinsic_ to their minds. **By agreeing to this misperception, you are choosing to enter your own shadow, where you won't see what you're really doing.** You become a beacon of darkness yourself. The more you do this, the more others will perceive _your_ evil as intrinsic — and the _less_ you will recognize it in yourself.

<p align="center" width="100%"><img width="300px" src="./img/shared-devil.png"></p>

In more modern terms, it is the _evil global conspiracy_ — that secret cabal responsible for all the world's ills, yet whose full membership remains forever elusive.

> _And no wonder, for even Satan masquerades as an angel of light. So it is not strange that his ministers also masquerade as ministers of righteousness._ —2 Corinthians 11:14-16

Make no mistake: there are indeed people who have consciously invited in the Darkness in a way that we have not, and they _must_ be fought. But even in such cases, the evil is not _intrinsic_ — and perceiving it as such is always the same trap. It's not that they _don't know_ what they're doing. Of course they do — or rather, of course _part of them_ does, just like part of _us_ does. But the only way they can do it is that their self-deception is especially good at hiding it from conscious self-awareness — and also especially good at provoking us into violently attacking it in a way that will empower its true source; humanity's ultimate nemesis.

Hating them is thus _especially_ evil, in that it enables us to engage in much more profound self-deception than we otherwise could — and, by definition, be much less aware that we are doing so. When you look in their eyes and see "evil," what you are seeing is a place where society's dark activity has accumulated especially intensely — and a seductive invitation to pile on _more_ in a way that nobody can judge you for. Our culture's cumulative self-deception _necessitates_ their existence, and "benefits" from it, in that they serve the hidden purpose of drawing our attention away from the dark activity "in here."

That is why a part of our minds is so powerfully attracted to revenge fantasy films and the like. It is also why our political opponents dig in their heels when we mock and shame them: part of us _needs_ them to, so that we and they can continue to act as covers for each other's self-deception.

    <em>The Equalizer 3: EVEN MOAR EQUALIZERING!</em>
</p>

To be clear: self-deceptive violence _can_ suppress other people's darkness — at least, in public, and for a time. We can thus easily convince ourselves that it "worked" — but only because we choose not to look too closely at the full implications of our behavior. If you look closely enough, you will always be able to find the fingerprints of your own darkness imprinted on events distant in time and space; events that you normally feel absolutely no connection to, let alone any complicity for — indeed, the very places that trigger the most self-righteous outrage. But such perception is normally not available to us, unless we have done tremendous amounts of "inner work."

If all this is so, then what are we to do? Is there such a thing as fighting _without_ self-deception?

---

In truth, **the only weapon we have against the darkness is our Light.** You could also call it _compassion_ or _kindness_ — **and it has nothing to do with being nice.**

True compassion can be soft and gentle, or fierce and [even violent](https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/dalai-gun/), depending on what's required. It can look like mocking or shaming, and leverage _apparent_ contempt. But it arises from a very different aspect of mind, and has a radically different effect on all minds involved, both friend and foe. It contains not even a trace of malice or self-righteousness (though it can arise from an outrage that is free of those dark sentiments). Its profound integrity prevents the darkness in others from finding easy justification for itself.

Compassion is simply about being free of self-deception, so that our attempts to fight evil do not have the "unintended" consequence of creating more. From here, genuine contempt (for people) is impossible, because you clearly see the sense in which the Darkness is impersonal, despite people having _chosen_ it in some sense. It is always a trap — and now you see exactly how it works. This is hard to communicate, but we will try.

The secret purpose of contempt is to telegraph our own inner darkness to others while convincing us that we're doing no such thing. This subconsciously triggers their "evil detector," which makes them feel compelled to fight back. But since we don't know that we're doing this, we take this apparent recalcitrance as confirmation that _they_ are evil, which licenses escalation. Consciously, we act dismayed, but our darkness is secretly rejoicing. It is a kind of "secret handshake" between theirs and ours; one that you can learn to perceive.

All of this only works because part of us _knows_ that we're doing it, and part of them knows that we know, etc. — but at the same time, we both _don't_ know. It is our supposed inability to recognize this that makes it "dark" in the first place. 

**Evil is ultimately nothing but _the willingness to look away_ — not just from the darkness "out there," but from the darkness "in here."** But what is it that we're looking away _from_, exactly? To say that "evil is the willingness to look away from evil" would be circular.

It is only through compassion — freedom from self-deception — that we discover how to fight evil in a way that actually works.

**At its fiercest, the Light can look almost indistinguishable from the darkness — _almost._** It is precisely this difficulty in distinguishing "fierce kindness" from evil that allows the latter to take control — but part of you always knows.

This is the most humbling discovery: that part of us somehow always knew. We chose our agendas and ideologies over our kindness, telling ourselves that they were more "helpful," and believing it with such intense fervor that we really believed it. We felt that even if we had to face our conscience one day, we would be able to tell it with a straight face that we were doing our best. In one sense, we really were.  But part of us knew that we had no leg to stand on when looking down on others.

This is the most painful realization, but also the most liberating. We see that all that is required to redeem ourselves is to _choose to look_. Doing so even once, we see that we never truly _wanted_ to look away; that we never _could_ want such a thing — and that nobody else could either, if only they remembered. This is complete redemption.

How astonishing that a near-infinite amount of evil could spring from such an innocent mistake, echoing across (apparent) space and time. What a tragedy! We make a firm commitment to never forget — and to serve as a reminder to others when they do. We recall that this is why we are here in the first place.

This commitment ripples throughout reality, cultivating the ground for others to follow suit in their own time. **This is how the Light spreads.** It is the greatest gift we have to offer the world, and it doesn't require any special circumstances. Every moment is a fresh opportunity to _look_.

Why do wise people urge compassion for evildoers? Are they being naïve? Or could it be that they see something that we don't?

---

Every one of us has had the experience of skirting our conscience before — behaving in a way that goes against our deepest values, but that we convince ourselves is okay. Part of us knows _perfectly well_ that what we are doing is wrong, but that knowledge is carefully shielded from conscious self-reflection: it is "kept dark."

Maybe we've helped ourselves to "a little extra" at the expense of a company, convinced that we're only harming its wealthy (and greedy) owners. Maybe it turns out that the owners weren't so wealthy after all, or that our behavior subtly harmed many other people indirectly. But our minds found an excuse for those too — or else blocked that knowledge entirely from conscious awareness.

Or perhaps we were a little bit nasty to someone, convinced that they deserved it — having no deep insight into the true source of their misbehavior, and unable to admit that we just compounded their difficulties in life. We can't see that a tiny part of them was actually _trying_, and that our casual cruelty was the final straw. To hide this, we convince ourselves that _no_ part of them was trying; that they are _fundamentally morally defective,_ and thus beyond help. But it doesn't feel like we're _convincing_ ourselves; it simply feels like "the truth."

<p align="center" width="100%"><img width="300px" src="./img/half-evil.png"></p>

It is hard to admit that we're doing this, but what's even harder to admit is the impact it has. All the darkness in the world is intimately connected. Every act of unkindness propagates into the Whole, lowering the threshold for darkness to manifest elsewhere. Every act of self-deception makes it more likely that genuine atrocities will be committed by someone, somewhere — atrocities for which we will not only feel absolutely no complicity, but which will actually trigger _self-righteous outrage_, inciting us to compound the problem.

This is the secret mechanism by which evil spreads without anyone recognizing their role. It is why we feel contempt for people (and not just for their beliefs or behaviors). It is a trick to avoid confronting our own darkness by violently attacking it in others, thereby reinforcing it while feeling flawlessly certain that we are "helping." This generates a dark cover behind which our own self-deception can hide. It is an _impossibly_ clever trick.

<p align="center" width="100%"> <img width="300px" src="img/evil-above-world.png"> </p>

The reason we "can't" defeat evil as a society is that a deep part of us knows that fully exposing it "out there" would also expose it "in here" — and we are not ready for that just yet. Contempt is our way of _pretending_ to expose it.

> _For so long as the root of wickedness is hidden, it is strong. But when it is recognized, it is dissolved. When it is revealed, it perishes. ... It is powerful because we have not recognized it._ — The Gospel of Philip

From a certain perspective, the darkness appears sentient; even intelligent. Yours triggers mine, which triggers yours, etc., almost as though they are _allied_. In fact, if you look closely, you'll see that your darkness and mine aren't truly separate: they behave more like appendages of a _distributed malevolent entity_, manipulating all of humanity from within the dark crevices of our own minds; the places where we dare not look.

It is what some cultures know as the _Devil_ — and it is as "real" as anything you can touch. It keeps our attention perpetually fixated outward, so that we never look too closely "in here" — the one place where we have direct power over it. Its greatest trick is to make you perceive other people's evil as being _intrinsic_ to their minds. **By agreeing to this misperception, you are choosing to enter your own shadow, where you won't see what you're really doing.** You thereby become a beacon of darkness yourself. The more you do this, the more others will perceive _your_ evil as intrinsic — and the _less_ you will recognize it in yourself.

<p align="center" width="100%"><img width="300px" src="./img/shared-devil.png"></p>

In more modern terms, it is the _evil global conspiracy_ — that secret cabal responsible for all the world's ills, yet whose full membership remains forever elusive. It is the _primordial_ evil conspiracy; the one to which all the rest owe their existence, and to which they ultimately filter up — and _we_ are its minions. All the conspiracies you can identify "out there" are rooted in this shared hidden aspect of mind. They feel "shadowy" because they are outer reflections of our collective unconscious. To believe that you have pinned it down externally is to fall into its most basic trap.

"The elites" may well be playing us off each other to take attention away from themselves — but the Devil is playing a _much_ bigger game; one in which even the elites are merely pawns. It controls our perception and models of reality so completely that we can hardly even fathom its existence. We feel that the dark state of our world must be due to individuals who are fundamentally unlike us, and whose violent elimination would therefore bring peace. It is astonishing that we never notice where these dark thoughts actually originate from, and what master they secretly serve.

> _And no wonder, for even Satan masquerades as an angel of light. So it is not strange that his ministers also masquerade as ministers of righteousness._ —2 Corinthians 11:14-16

Make no mistake: there are indeed people who have consciously invited in the Darkness in a way that we have not, and they _must_ be fought relentlessly. But even in such cases, the evil is not _intrinsic_ — and perceiving it as such is always the same trap. It's not that they _don't know_ what they're doing. Of course they do — or rather, of course _part of them_ does, just like part of _us_ does. But the only way they can do it is that their self-deception is especially good at hiding it from conscious self-awareness — and also especially good at provoking us into violently attacking it in a way that will empower its true source; humanity's ultimate nemesis.

Hating them is thus _especially_ evil, in that it enables us to engage in much more profound self-deception than we otherwise could — and, by definition, be much less aware that we are doing so. When you look in their eyes and see "evil," what you are seeing is a place where society's dark activity has accumulated especially intensely — and a seductive invitation to pile on _more_ in a way that nobody can judge you for. Our culture's cumulative self-deception _necessitates_ their existence, and "benefits" from it, in that they serve the hidden purpose of drawing our attention away from the dark activity "in here."

That is why a part of our minds is so powerfully attracted to revenge fantasy films and the like. It is also why our political opponents dig in their heels when we mock and shame them: part of us _needs_ them to, so that we and they can continue to act as covers for each other's self-deception.

    <em>The Equalizer 3: EVEN MOAR EQUALIZERING!</em>
</p>

To be clear: self-deceptive violence _can_ suppress other people's darkness — at least, in public, and for a time. We can thus easily convince ourselves that it "worked" — but only because we choose not to look too closely at the full implications of our behavior. If you look closely enough, you will always be able to find the fingerprints of your own darkness imprinted on events distant in time and space; events that you normally feel absolutely no connection to, let alone any complicity for — indeed, the very places that trigger the most self-righteous outrage. But such perception is normally not available to us, unless we have done tremendous amounts of "inner work."

If all this is so, then what are we to do? Is there such a thing as fighting _without_ self-deception?

---

In truth, **the only weapon we have against the darkness is our Light.** You could also call it _compassion_ or _kindness_ — **and it has nothing to do with being nice.**

True compassion can be soft and gentle, or fierce and [even violent](https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/dalai-gun/), depending on what's required. It can look like mocking or shaming, and leverage _apparent_ contempt. But it arises from a very different aspect of mind, and has a radically different effect on all minds involved, both friend and foe. It contains not even a trace of malice or self-righteousness (though it can arise from an outrage that is free of those dark sentiments). Its profound integrity prevents the darkness in others from finding easy justification for itself.

Compassion is simply about being free of self-deception, so that our attempts to fight evil do not have the "unintended" consequence of creating more. From here, genuine contempt (for people) is impossible, because you clearly see the sense in which the Darkness is impersonal, despite people having _chosen_ it in some sense. It is always a trap.

**Evil is ultimately nothing but _the willingness to look away_ — not just from the darkness "out there," but from the darkness "in here."** But what is it that we're looking away _from_, exactly? To say that "evil is the willingness to look away from evil" would be circular.

---

There is a profound and astonishing sense in which we **are** everyone and everything. Realizing this in its entirety is known as _enlightenment_ (en-_Light_-enment), and is indeed a lofty goal — but all of us can sense it at all times, to one degree or another. It is why we sometimes thank other people for acts of kindness that don't benefit us directly. We intuit that what happens to any part ultimately happens to the whole. **You are the Light** — and so is everyone else. This may sound mystical or "woo woo," but it can be known directly and concretely. All self-deception — and thus all evil — ultimately boils down to our inability (or unwillingness) to see this.

Contempt is intrinsically self-deceptive: it is the pretense that we are _fundamentally better_ than others, which the deepest part of us knows is a sham — and which they can sense too, no matter how "evil" they are. This is what enables it to work: simply by showing (genuine) contempt, we are telegraphing our own self-deception to them while hiding it from ourselves, thus giving their self-deception a "hook" by which to justify itself, while giving ourselves plausible deniability.

(Ironically, this only works because of our fundamental unity. It is how [we know that they know that we know... etc.](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/common-knowledge/), which is what guarantees that it will work.)

Looking at the state of the world, you could be forgiven for believing that there's an _evil global conspiracy_ pulling the strings from behind the scenes. In a sense, there is — but it's not the one that you're probably thinking of.

---

People are only able to cause harm due to a kind of self-deception: part of them knows _perfectly well_ that they are doing wrong, but the full implications of their behavior are carefully shielded from conscious self-reflection. All they hear are their own clever justifications. It is this secret mechanism that has enabled _all the evil there ever was_ — and it has enabled our own misbehavior too, if we're honest. Every one of us has skirted our conscience before, pretending either that we couldn't hear it or that we didn't have to listen.

Our self-deception hides itself from us while tricking us into perceiving other people's as _intrinsic evil_. This makes us violently attack them, which they subconsciously recognize as self-deception, making them perceive _us_ as evil, which they then use as further justification for their misbehavior. _This is what we secretly wanted_. Their recalcitrance, combined with our "inability" to see that we provoked it, together serve as "proof" that they are evil, thus licensing us to escalate.

This is just one of a million clever little ways that the darkness "in here" amplifies the darkness "out there" while hiding itself from us. Every act of self-deception lowers the threshold for darkness to manifest elsewhere, so that we will not only feel no connection to it, but will feel compelled to pile on _more._ It keeps us fixated on the darkness "out there" specifically so that we never notice what is happening "in here." It is such a clever trap that it almost smells... designed.

<p align="center" width="100%"><img width="300px" src="./img/half-evil.png"></p>

In truth, there is no darkness "in here" and darkness "out there"; there is only the one _Darkness_, behaving like a distributed malevolent entity, flowing freely between minds, shape-shifting at every turn, tricking us into tilting at windmills. Just when you think you've caught a hold of it in someone else's mind, it sneaks out the back door of theirs and enters through yours. You have unknowingly invited it in — and once it is there, you are completely at its mercy; your internal detectors having been taken offline.

This is what we are sensing when we suspect an "evil global conspiracy." It is the _primordial_ evil conspiracy; the one to which all the rest owe their existence, and to which they ultimately filter up. Almost everything we do to "fight" it is secretly in its service. It is made of the disowned aspects of all of our minds working together. We will never fully unearth it "out there" until it has been excavated "in here."  You can treat this as an allegory, but you can also learn to perceive it clearly and directly.

> _For so long as the root of wickedness is hidden, it is strong. But when it is recognized, it is dissolved. When it is revealed, it perishes. ... It is powerful because we have not recognized it._ — The Gospel of Philip

Everything comes down to detecting its dark presence in your mind. At a coarse level, it feels like malice, contempt (for people), or self-righteousness. These are _always_ hidden attempts to darken the world. At a more subtle level, it feels like selfishness and entitlement. Subtler still, like apathy. Your deepest desire is to shine your Light powerfully into this world. It hijacks this noble intention, replacing it with clever counterfeits — such as the violent urge to hunt down other people's darkness.

<p align="center" width="100%"><img width="300px" src="./img/parasite.png"></p>

This is a subtle point, and easily misunderstood. Your Light can indeed hunt down and defeat the Darkness in others, but it does this by showing you how it is _not_ intrinsic to their minds. Contempt is replaced by a fierce compassion. It is as though you are suddenly granted perception of a previously-concealed route through their inner madness; through lifetimes of confusion. When the Light enters that secret place, they remember that they _don't want to be doing this,_ and the Darkness slowly loses its grip.

This is how the Light spreads.

> _And no wonder, for even Satan masquerades as an angel of light. So it is not strange that his ministers also masquerade as ministers of righteousness._ —2 Corinthians 11:14-16

The "evil global conspiracy" hinges entirely on our inability to stay firmly committed to our own Light for long enough to discover this hidden possibility. Every time any one of us steps back into the Darkness; gives in to our self-deception; we hide it a little more from collective view, thus inducing others to throw in the towel. Our greatest gift to this world is to _hold the line_; to refuse to enter the Darkness at any cost. Our own ability to do this has depended on the grace of countless others, such as those who have shown us kindness even when we didn't "deserve" it. We can in turn share that grace and hold the Light for others, _especially_ when they themselves cannot. _It is what we are here for._

This has nothing to do with being nice or gentle. The Light can be fierce; even [violent](https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/dalai-gun/) if the situation warrants it. It can take almost any form whatsoever. Indeed, the more entrenched the Darkness it is "battling," the more it begins to look outwardly like Darkness itself — and thus the easier it gets to lie to ourselves about our true intentions. This is how the Darkness keeps sneaking in the back door of our minds.

> _I wish I could show you, when you are lonely or in darkness, the astonishing Light of your own Being._ —Hafiz of Shiraz

At the ultimate level, you _are_ everyone and everything, in a profound and surprising sense. Realizing this in its entirety is known as _enlightenment_ (en-Light-enment), but all of us can sense it to some degree or another at all times. It is why we sometimes thank others for being generous with strangers even when no (apparent) benefit accrues to us. At some level, we can feel that what happens to any of us affects all of us.

Our true enemy is never other people, but the darkness in all of our minds. The more we heal our own, the more we perceive what is preventing others from giving up theirs, finally enabling us to fight evil in ways that don't secretly reinforce it. Forsaking any one of us forsakes all of us. We only behave this way because we're not ready to come Home yet ourselves, and distancing ourselves from others is a powerful way to keep the illusion alive. This is the true origin of contempt, and thus, of evil.

I am very far from enlightened myself, and don't pretend to have the wisdom to put this knowledge to use in the truly challenging places it is needed most today. But I do wish this perspective to become common knowledge. The more consciously aware we are of this trap, the less willing we will be to tolerate it in our enemies, our allies, and most importantly, ourselves. The Darkness survives by hiding itself. Let us resolve to give it no more safe harbor in the most intimate of places: our very own minds.

As much as we may want to defeat evil in the world, there is an aspect of our mind that continually sabotages our efforts. Moreover, part of us _knows_ that it is doing this. This is extremely difficult to admit — but it is only by appreciating the source of that difficulty that we begin to understand the very origin of evil, and to perceive the horrifying trap in which nearly all of humanity is caught...

---

There's a bizarre state the human mind can get into where we hide aspects of our own minds from ourselves. If you've ever skirted your conscience before — and who hasn't? — you know this state intimately. Recall what it's like. Part of your mind knows perfectly well that you are doing "wrong," but that knowledge is carefully shielded from conscious self-reflection. All you hear are your own clever justifications. In a sense, you really don't know that you're doing wrong — and you _certainly_ don't know that you're being self-deceptive. It is this dark state that has enabled _all the evil there ever was._ If only we could see that we were in it _while_ we were in it, it would naturally begin to dissolve. But it has powerful tools to evade detection — almost as if it's _alive_.

<p align="center" width="100%"><img width="300px" src="./img/half-evil.png"></p>

Something deep within us knows that the "bad people" are only acting from self-deception, which means that there's at least a tiny aspect of their mind that doesn't want to be doing wrong. But this would mean that we're not _fundamentally_ superior to them like we tell ourselves, and that our cruelty therefore isn't so righteous after all. To hide this knowledge, our mind does something _fiendishly_ clever: it makes us behave in ways that bury that "tiny aspect" of their mind deeper, but blocks the knowledge that we're doing so, so that we can "honestly" tell ourselves that no such aspect exists. This is _profound_ self-deception. But what kind of behavior could reliably deepen another person's self-deception without alerting us that we're doing so? The answer is astonishing.

Simply by _feeling contempt,_ we are telegraphing our own self-deception to the world. Our target instinctively recognizes it, which makes them see _us_ as evil, enabling them to feel more justified in their behavior. But we "don't know" that we provoked this. Hence, our mere subconscious intention to darken another mind actually did so, in a way that gives us plausible deniability. The reason we know this will work, and the reason they take the bait, is that it is **exactly** the same dark phenomenon / entity expressing itself through both of our minds. _The Darkness in all of our minds is secretly allied_, orchestrating countless such interactions. If we're not in direct contact with our enemy, it spreads through our "allies" in its purest form: contempt. One way or another, the Darkness always leaks.

In fact, any time we engage in _any_ kind of self-deception, we are secretly inducing the same tendency in others. This is true of all the million tiny self-serving behaviors that we convince ourselves are "no big deal" or that supposedly stick it to the "bad people" — blissfully unaware that our darkness is secretly _empowering_ theirs as a way of hiding itself from us. To be clear: our darkness _can_ suppress other people's misbehavior — at least, in public, and for a time. We can thus convince ourselves that it "worked" — but only because we're avoiding looking too closely. Darkness never actually fights darkness; it only pretends to, in countless clever ways that evade our detection. Even if we somehow eliminated all the "bad people" from the world  — and they surely wouldn't go willingly — their evil would remain. That's because the profound self-deception required to believe in such a plan _is_ their evil expressing itself through our minds — and our inability to own up to this is reflected in theirs.

<p align="center" width="100%"><img width="300px" src="img/devil-vs-devil.png"></p>

Try as we may to wriggle around this maddening constraint, it is fruitless. _Any_ plan that requires distinguishing the "good guys" from the "bad guys" is destined to fail in the same way, because such a plan can only be hatched by the self-deceptive aspect of our minds. A deep part of us knows this, but that knowledge somehow stays hidden from both personal and societal awareness. It's almost as if dark forces are conspiring to keep it hidden...

> _And no wonder, for even Satan masquerades as an angel of light. So it is not strange that his ministers also masquerade as ministers of righteousness._ —2 Corinthians 11:14-16

Looking at the state of our world, one could be forgiven for believing there's an _evil global conspiracy_ running the show from behind the scenes. In a sense, there is. 

It is the one Darkness, freely manifesting through all of our minds, behaving like a single _distributed malevolent entity_. It comprises the disowned aspects of all of our minds, hiding itself perfectly from view. This is what you are seeing when you look into the eyes of an "evil person." It is the _primordial_ evil conspiracy; the one to which all the rest owe their existence, and to which they ultimately filter up. Make no mistake: there are indeed concrete conspiracies in our world, but they all originate from a common source; one that we each have intimate access to. Almost everything we do to "fight" it is secretly in its service. As long as we continue to believe that it originates "out there," we give it safe harbor "in here"; a breeding ground from which to spread.

<p align="center" width="100%"><img width="300px" src="./img/shared-devil.png"></p>

It is what some cultures know as the Devil, and it is as "real" as anything you can touch. It lives deep in the crevices of our minds; the dark places that we'd rather not look, communicating with itself beneath our conscious awareness. Every act of unkindness ripples through its terrible body, lowering the threshold for darkness to manifest elsewhere; eventually erupting in the form of genuine atrocities that we not only don't recognize our own connection to, but that actually provoke _self-righteous outrage_, inspiring us to pile on more.

Still others know it as "human nature"; the "fact" that we are fundamentally greedy and selfish creatures, and thus deserving of whatever horrible fate befalls us. The Darkness knows exactly how to manipulate each mind so that we feel powerless to confront it, and justified in harboring our own little sliver, for fear of missing out on its tainted rewards. It uses your own inner voice to convince you that it's _you_, but it's not. It is a _parasite_ — and like any parasite, it can be evicted.

> _For so long as the root of wickedness is hidden, it is strong. But when it is recognized, it is dissolved. When it is revealed, it perishes. ... It is powerful because we have not recognized it._ — The Gospel of Philip 

There can be times in our lives — such as on our deathbeds, or on psychedelic trips — when the infection suddenly lifts. It feels exactly like you'd expect to feel if being freed from a demonic possession. You discover that you never _wanted_ to harbor the Darkness — but that you _were_ harboring it anyway, in countless tiny ways. Or rather, you did "want" to harbor it — but only because it had hijacked your mind, using your fears as leverage, and pretending to _be_ you.

<p align="center" width="100%"><img width="300px" src="./img/parasite.png"></p>

On one hand, you are certainly responsible for harboring it, and for all the dark results that inevitably flowed from that decision. Part of you knew _perfectly well_ what you were doing, even as you convincingly pretended not to — or that this knowledge would never come to Light. Now you see how silly that was. The knowledge can be buried for a time, but it _always_ resurfaces — and much more painfully than if we'd simply confronted it head-on at the time.

At the same time, it would be crazy to shame or judge ourselves for having made this choice. First of all because (contemptuous) shame and judgement exist only as tools to _reinforce_ it, but also because part of us — the _truest_ part — never actually wanted it. Not because we are among the special "good people" (a dangerous idea at the very _heart_ of self-deception), but because self-deception is completely un-wantable when seen for what it actually is. The only part of anyone that wants it _is_ it — and "it" isn't ultimately a real thing, though it very much behaves like one. It is an absence convincingly masquerading as a presence.

It is only once we see how badly it has fooled us that we begin to appreciate how cleverly it has seduced others — and why hating them for it does exactly the opposite of what we previously thought it would. Even the people who claim to want it are suffering from something like Stockholm syndrome, and contempt just shoves them _toward_ their captor; our common enemy. The more clearly we see this, the more a deeper aspect of our mind begins to shine through.

> _I wish I could show you, when you are lonely or in darkness, the astonishing Light of your own Being._ —Hafiz of Shiraz

Underneath all the self-deception is your pure, infinite Love for all of reality. This is what you most fundamentally _are._ It is not something soft and weak: that is a lie the Darkness tells to prevent you from discovering its full power. It has nothing to do with being _nice_ — though that may be its natural expression in most everyday circumstances. It can be fierce or even [violent](https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/dalai-gun/) if necessary. It can take on almost any form whatsoever, adapting perfectly to the situation. It is a Love that excludes nothing and forsakes no-one — including the target of its wrath, should that be necessary. It may even look like contempt on the surface. At its most intense, it can appear almost indistinguishable from the Darkness itself — _almost_.

It is this apparent difficulty that allows the Darkness to sneak back into our minds, mimicking the voice of our inner Light. This usually feels like malice, self-righteousness, or genuine contempt (for the _person_, as opposed to just their beliefs or behaviors). It is very easy to convince ourselves that these are signs of our Light — but part of us always knows the truth. Our agendas and ideologies; thoughts and beliefs, cannot tell us which voice we are following, no matter how well-intentioned they are. There is exactly one thing deep within us that Knows, and it is always there if we _just look_. Thus, in the end, everything comes down to _remembering to look._ So much suffering could be avoided if we did just that much.

In the same way that acting from Darkness inevitably spreads the Darkness, acting from the Light spreads the Light. Just as the willingness to deceive yourself entices others to do the same, your deep resolve to _never look away_ from your Light reminds others that such a thing is possible; that the Light is not just a myth. This doesn't magically turn "evil people" good overnight, but its deep integrity prevents their self-deception from finding the hook that it would otherwise use to justify itself, thereby weakening it. Their mind is lost in a story about how this world is a Dark place that requires them to clutch onto their own darkness — but despite their most powerful attempts to provoke yours, you refuse to concede. A sliver of Light enters their confused dream, subtly undermining its whole foundation, and planting a seed that will ultimately demolish it. With enough sensitivity, you can actually perceive this happening. Your firm resolve in such moments matters far more than you can possibly know.

---

It turns out that at the ultimate level, you _are_ everyone and everything, in a profound and surprising sense. [You are the trees, the birds, the good people and the bad](unity.md). Realizing this in its entirety is known as _enlightenment_ (en-Light-enment), but all of us can sense it to some degree or another at all times. It is why we sometimes thank others for being generous with strangers even when no (apparent) benefit accrues to us. At some level, we can feel that what happens to any of us ultimately happens to all of us. In the same way, forsaking any one of us forsakes us all.

People are deeply, badly confused. It is only our Darkness that feels any satisfaction in relegating them to the abyss as some sort of punishment. In truth, they are different "versions" of us, and we are only punishing ourselves. Some part of us is not ready to come Home yet, and unkindness is the secret tool we use to keep the illusion alive.

> *Darkness cannot drive out darkness, only light can do that. Hate cannot drive out hate, only love can do that.* ―Martin Luther King, Jr.

Our own ability to uphold the Light has required the firm commitment of countless others, including those who have shown us kindness even when we didn't "deserve" it — and even when we couldn't recognize it as kindness at the time. We can in turn share that grace and hold the Light for others when they themselves cannot, in whatever form that Light must take given its unique circumstances. This is what we are _here_ for. There's nothing much else worth doing in this place.

I am far from enlightened myself and have no right to lecture anyone. All I know is that it would be a shame not to share this insight that befell me, and all I ask is that you hold my feet to the fire when I inevitably forget myself.

> _Be kind, for everyone you meet is fighting a great battle._ —Author unknown

As much as we may want to defeat evil in the world, there is an aspect of our mind that continually sabotages our efforts. Moreover, part of us _knows_ that it is doing this. This is extremely difficult to admit — but it is only by appreciating the source of that difficulty that we begin to understand the very origin of evil, and to perceive the horrifying trap in which nearly all of humanity is caught...

If you wish to defeat the evil in the world, you must first defeat the evil in your own mind. But why?

---

<p align="center" width="100%"><img width="300px" src="./img/half-evil.png"></p>

All evil works in essentially the same way. Part of the person's mind knows perfectly well that they are doing _wrong_, but that knowledge is very carefully shielded from conscious self-reflection, so that it doesn't _feel_ wrong. All they hear are their own clever justifications. Every one of us knows this state intimately well. We have all skirted our conscience before, pretending either that we couldn't hear it or that we didn't have to listen. Our examples may differ in degree, but _not_ in kind.

We don't mock and shame our enemies because of the good it will do, but because they are easy targets for our self-deception. We use them as excuses to self-aggrandize and to justify our own self-serving agendas. But we do not consciously realize that we are doing this. It is hidden from our minds in precisely the same way that _their_ misbehavior is hidden from them. Yet, you can learn to see that your mind is spreading darkness if you know how to look. Our mistake is that we rarely look.

If you did, here's what you would find. Your enemy can subconsciously sense that you are engaged in essentially the _same_ deception that you are viciously judging _them_ for, which makes _you_ appear evil to _them_. They therefore feel compelled to return the favor, which appears evil to you. After all, your intentions were pure. Any _decent_ person would have repented or at least introspected in the face of such goodness. But they instead doubled down, proving that they are indeed _fundamentally morally defective_, thus licensing you to escalate. This is _profound_ self-deception.

<p align="center" width="100%"><img width="300px" src="img/devil-vs-devil.png"></p>

What we cannot see is that something in our minds _needs_ to keep animosity alive in this world, because if all the darkness out there were to suddenly evaporate, our _own_ would become impossible to hide. So the deception in all of our minds is cooperating, conspiring to keep all of humanity mired in darkness, without anyone discovering its true origin within their very own minds. It is impossible to overstate the fiendish cleverness of this ruse. The _only_ reason you ever perceive anyone as fundamentally defective, or yourself as intrinsically superior, is to perpetuate animosity.

In fact, our darkness is not merely cooperating. Our cumulative darkness actually behaves more like a singular distributed malevolent entity; manipulating all of humanity from beneath our conscious thresholds. It is why we suspect the existence of an evil global conspiracy. It is the _primordial_ evil conspiracy; the one to which all the rest owe their existence, and to which they all ultimately filter up. The Christians know it as the Devil, and the Buddhists call it the ego. You can treat it as a metaphor, but it is also as real as anything you can touch. Unkindness _always_ feeds the Beast.

<p align="center" width="100%"><img width="300px" src="./img/shared-devil.png"></p>


Make no mistake: there are certainly people who knowingly embrace the darkness, and who are conspiring to bring great harm — and they must be stopped. Kindness doesn't mean being nice or gentle; it can be fierce or even violent if necessary. It need not look like conventional kindness at all. There is no particular form that it must take. It simply means recognizing when we are being overtaken by the darkness, and refusing to give it even an inch.

> _And no wonder, for even Satan masquerades as an angel of light. So it is not strange that his ministers also masquerade as ministers of righteousness._ —2 Corinthians 11:14-16

How can you recognize that the darkness has infiltrated your mind? It can be extremely tricky. It usually begins with the perception that the evil in others is somehow _intrinsic_ to their minds. It feels like you have finally caught a hold of the darkness, and must _punish_ it. And because their darkness appears inseparable from their very being, you must punish _them._ But this is an illusion. The very deepest aspect of your mind is always able to perceive the part of theirs that is uncorrupted and uncorruptible — even when they cannot consciously detect it in themselves. It is only ever the darkness in your own mind that shields you from seeing this, because when you do see it, all malice evaporates from your mind and your blinding Light is revealed — the one thing that actually knows how to dispel the darkness.

This Light is what you _are_ in your innermost being. It is the Christ within; your Buddha-nature. It simply cannot _feel_ malice, contempt, or self-righteousness toward anybody, because it sees their inner Light too, no matter how hidden. It sees how their minds have been enslaved by the darkness, and how to free them of it. But while your inner Light is a real thing — indeed, the realest _possible_ thing — the darkness is ultimately an illusion and can thus always be dispelled. It is nothing but the _absence_ of the Light. Humans are not _fundamentally_ greedy or selfish, even if our darkness is so deeply entrenched that it appears convincingly otherwise. It can be undone, and we each have a role to play in undoing it.

> _I wish I could show you, when you are lonely or in darkness, the astonishing Light of your own Being._ —Hafiz of Shiraz

At the very deepest level, nobody could ever actually _want_ to turn away from their Light, because it is the very fulfillment they unknowingly seek. But for reasons unknown, the Light sometimes undergoes a spontaneous apparent separation from itself. When this occurs, the mind becomes confused, fearing that it somehow caused this separation. This kernel of guilt makes it want to hide from the Light, but there is nowhere to run. This triggers a runaway process in which it must increasingly convince itself that it *is* the Light, to avoid confronting that primordial yet illusory guilt. Having thus convinced itself of its own righteousness, it roams the world, hunting down those who refuse to "_see_ the light."

In other words, our decision to see other people as defective is nothing but fear of our own enlightenment, and by giving it credence, we further distance ourselves and them from the peace we most deeply long for. It is a tragic mistake of the highest order. In fact, the reality you perceive as external to yourself is nothing but a projection of your own confusion. I know this is hard to swallow, but you may take a hint from neuroscience, which confirms that our perceived reality is a kind of hallucination. It turns out you can learn to introspect and get to the heart of this illusion. There, you discover the astonishing truth: that you _are_ everyone and everything, just pretending that you're not. Harming the world always harms yourself, and by forsaking others, you are only forsaking yourself. You cannot ultimately "get away" with anything, so why bother trying? You might as well just save yourself lifetimes of needless suffering and head toward the Light _now_.

Even if this seems far-fetched to you now, something deep within you knows that it is only ever your Love that nudges us all toward the more beautiful world our hearts know is possible. Everything else either just shuffles the bits around or drives us further away. It may then appear convincingly as though we are making progress, but it is an illusion. So remember your inner Light, and resolve never to stray from it, under any circumstances. For when your perceived reality is withdrawn back into the Light from whence it arose — in other words, what we commonly know as "death" — you will remember that all else was merely distraction, and that you somehow always knew this, all along, even when you pretended not to.

May all beings be free from suffering and its causes. Amen.

Evil is a kind of mind virus, and the way it works is impossibly clever. It shields us from perceiving the harmful aspects of our own behaviors while highly sensitizing us to those of others. The result is that we viciously attack them for it, not realizing that this itself is only a manifestation of our own darkness. Our own parasite is loudly telegraphing its existence to our enemy in order to provoke theirs, which we can then blame them for. The truth is that they are perceiving genuine darkness in us — the very thing that we are contemptuously judging them for. But we cannot admit this, because then we would have no leg to stand on. Indeed, the whole purpose of contempt is to drive the parasite so deeply into their minds that we can convince ourselves that it is not merely a parasite, but actually _intrinsic_ to their minds; that they are _fundamentally_ defective and thus beyond help. The more we do this, the easier it becomes to overlook the self-serving aspects of our own actions and agendas.

This is the trap in which the whole world is caught; darkness provoking darkness at every turn without anyone recognizing their own complicity. We each feel like we are advancing our righteous agendas, but the only real winner is the darkness itself. This is why we sometimes suspect the existence of an "evil global conspiracy." The parasites in all of our minds are conspiring, together behaving more like a singular _distributed malevolent entity_, manipulating all of humanity from beneath our conscious thresholds. The Christians know it as the Devil, and the Buddhists call it the ego. You can treat it as a metaphor, but it is also as real as anything you can touch. It is the _primordial_ evil conspiracy; the one to which all the rest owe their existence, and to which they ultimately filter up. Every act of unkindness we have ever perpetrated on _anyone_ has secretly been in its service — and part of us has always known this. But this knowledge rarely reaches conscious awareness. We only hear the part of our mind that cleverly calculates how our behavior was a net good. The knowledge of our darkness exists in a kind of limbo state, but we _can_ learn to become fully conscious of it. When we do, something astonishing happens.

---

When the darkness lifts, it feels exactly like you'd imagine feeling being freed of a demonic possession. Underneath it is a Light so vast it defies description. It is what you most essentially are. You see that you never truly wanted to cause harm; never _could_ want such a thing — nor, surprisingly, could anybody else. In fact, it turns out that you _are_ everyone and everything else, just pretending that you're not. One consciousness, looking out through countless eyes.  There are many ways to say this, all of which sound absurd to the rational mind, but the deepest part of you knows it to be true. When you fully unveil the Light in yourself, you automatically see it in everyone else — including those who normally seem not to have any. This is what the darkness is trying to hide. Every selfish act ultimately harms you, and every selfless act benefits you — the _real_ you, so to speak. This is what humanity is slowly waking up to. But make no mistake: it is not all rainbows and sunshine.

You discover that you could _always_ perceive the Light in others — and thus you knew perfectly well that you were only shoving them deeper into the abyss; smothering their inner Light as it desperately (if unskillfully) tried to free itself of its shackles. You knew that you could get away with this, because almost nobody else could consciously perceive it: they, too, saw only "bad person." But there were always those with the eyes to see. They knew what you were doing — and yet, sinister as it was, they still held the Light for you, knowing that the real you could never want to do it. Sometimes this may have required tough love, but it was always love. It is only thanks to their profound grace that you've found your way out of the bewildering maze of mirrors that is the darkness. Yet they, too, cannot take credit for it; for this grace utterly transcends personal achievement.

You now stand face-to-face with all the harm you've ever perpetrated on the world since time immemorial, and it is far more than you could hope to clean up in a single lifetime. Seeing this hurts more than you can fathom. How widely and quickly it spread! The darkness exploited your fear and pride, enabling you to do things you couldn't have if only you had seen what was really happening. You lost contact with your absolute goodness, and went out searching for it _relatively_ — that is, by making other people bad. How ironic that our faint memory of our original goodness ends up causing so much harm! Of course, it is still your responsibility to clean it up. Your only atonement is to firmly commit to holding the Light for others, even when — indeed, _especially_ when — they cannot hold it for themselves. Far from being a burden, you discover that this has always been your true purpose; your deepest calling.

---

This is called compassion, and it has nothing to do with being nice. True compassion can be fierce, or even violent, as the situation warrants. Its only defining characteristic is that it is utterly free of self-deception. It does not perceive evil as intrinsic to any mind, and this seemingly-subtle change makes all the difference. It surgically targets the parasite itself, instead of the confused being who unwittingly harbors it. The profound integrity of this act prevents their darkness from using our own as an excuse to justify itself, thereby bypassing their defense mechanisms. The aspect of mind _beneath_ their parasite is confronted directly — something it is not accustomed to. It begins to remember that the _real_ fight isn't between the two of you, but between both of you and humanity's ultimate nemesis. They may still consciously perceive you as an enemy, but underneath, something much more profound is beginning to happen. Such behavior may not be as darkly pleasurable as violently dominating your enemies, but it is infinitely more valuable — not only to others, but also to you.

To be clear: it does no good to pretend that you can see the Light in others when you cannot. This can backfire miserably, as it rapidly degrades into merely being _nice._ Thus, neither pretending to see the good in others nor overlooking it is a viable strategy for defeating the darkness. The _only_ solution is to learn to actually see it, and the only way to do that is to fully uncover your own. There are countless methods for doing so, encoded both in ancient spiritual traditions and more modern techniques; ranging from meditation to psychedelics to shadow work and more. It is also astonishingly easy to lie to ourselves about whether we are actually wielding fierce compassion or merely pretending to. If there is even a _trace_ of malice, genuine contempt, or self-righteousness, it is always the darkness masquerading as the Light. In fact, the simplest measure of how much we are still hiding from yourself is how much we can still muster these sentiments for our enemies; the "bad people." As long as we still harbor them, we are always liable to slide down the dark path that has enabled all the atrocities there ever were. All that is required is the right — or wrong — confluence of circumstances. It happens faster than you can imagine. You _do not_ want to find yourself there.

There are vast and subtle networks of causality that we are normally unconscious of, and that secretly drive the fate of the world. If we pay attention only to the surface activity, we are missing out on the vast majority of what shapes our reality. Evil can look sweet and pretty, while kindness is sometimes violent. It is impossible to know which is which — and easy to convince ourselves otherwise — until we have done the deep inner work that melts the core confusion. So much of human activity is subtly (or grossly) self-deceptive — and any time any one of us engages in it, we induce the same tendency in others, be they friend or foe. Our true allies are not those who push the same agendas we do, nor are our enemies necessarily those who oppose us. At the ultimate level, something much more profound is going on. To divide the world into the fundamentally good and bad is to miss the point. Your true enemy lies within, and the more you defeat it "in here," the more it vanishes "out there." What lies underneath is a profound Love for all of reality; one that excludes nothing and forsakes no-one, including the targets of its fearsome wrath, should that be necessary. Forsaking others ultimately only forsakes ourselves.

---

I wish I could tell you that I have completed the journey myself, but I've only learned enough to see that I am still far from it. Yet we each catch glimpses from time to time, and it is our duty to carry those glimpses into the world as best we are able. I am still liable to mess things up while believing otherwise, and I hope you will hold my feet to the fire when I do. All I can do is promise to do the same for you.

May all beings be free from suffering and its causes. Amen.

Evil is a kind of mind virus, and the way it works is exceptionally clever. It blinds us to the harmful and self-serving aspects of our own actions while powerfully sensitizing us to those of others. When we look in the eyes of our enemies, we see evil, which makes us want to viciously attack it by attacking _them_. The problem is, this only triggers their defense mechanisms, driving them further into the hands of their parasite. In truth, we were _hoping_ for this outcome, because the deeper we can shove them into the dark, the easier it becomes to convince ourselves that they are _fundamentally_ defective; that their evil is _intrinsic_ to their minds, unlike ours. They're not just acting out evil, like we all sometimes do; no, they simply _are_ evil. In this state, cruelty becomes noble, and we increasingly overlook the self-serving aspects of our own actions and agendas.

The deepest part of us can always perceive that they're acting from a parasite; one that we ourselves are highly susceptible to. This part has a much wiser way of dealing with evil — one that actually works, even if it brings less self-righteous satisfaction. Our mistake was choosing to listen to the _other_ voice; the one that told us we are intrinsically superior. The moment we made this choice, we _knew_ that our behavior would darken the world — and it is _this_ that our enemy picked up on. In that moment, they _knew_ that we were engaged in the very self-deception that we are so contemptuously judging them for. It is as though our own parasite secretly telegraphed itself to them, knowing fully well that their parasite would use it as an excuse to further ingratiate itself to them. In other words, our contempt acted as a kind of secret handshake between their darkness and ours. We may be enemies on the surface, but underneath, our darkness is secretly allied.

This is why we sometimes suspect the existence of an "evil global conspiracy." Our parasites are indeed conspiring, together behaving like a singular _distributed malevolent entity_, manipulating all of humanity from beneath our conscious thresholds.

Kindness is the hardest word to define, but also the most important. It doesn't mean being nice. Nice means pleasant and agreeable, which can actually be harmful in certain situations. Kindness is something much more profound. It is the right motivation in literally _every_ circumstance. But how could kindness be the correct response to evil?

---

Our usual instinct is to be nasty to perpetrators. We may have the good sense not to be overtly cruel, but we often can't help but inject at least a little bit of darkness into our interactions. We reason that as long as it produces a positive outcome — such as suppressing their misbehavior — that it's not actually dark in the first place. What could be wrong with harboring a bit of malice or contempt in our hearts, after all? They aren't externally visible, and therefore could have no effect on the world. And anyway, it's our right to feel how we do. But the darkness is infinitely more clever than you can fathom. Simply by harboring it, you are telegraphing to your enemy that you are under its malevolent sway. This provokes the darkness in them, which you then use as proof that you were right about them, thereby licensing escalation. Part of you _knows_ that this will be the outcome — but it's so cleverly disguised that nobody will be able to blame you for it. It is the perfect crime.

If you look carefully enough into your mind while feeling contempt for _anyone_ — that is, the sense that they are _fundamentally_ defective, and that you are _intrinsically_ superior — you will discover that its secret purpose is to shove them deeper _into_ the abyss; to _smother_ their inner Light, so that you can convince yourself that they _have_ no such Light. In this dark place, cruelty becomes righteous, and you _will_ overlook the harmful and self-serving aspects of your own actions and agendas. It is completely inevitable. This is impossibly dark behavior, and yet we never recognize it as such. Or more precisely, part of us _does_ recognize it, but we don't let this knowledge reach conscious awareness.

This is the secret mechanism behind _all the evil there ever was_. "Bad people" know perfectly well when they are doing wrong, but this knowledge is carefully shielded from conscious self-reflection, so that it doesn't _feel_ wrong. The reason we hate them is not to _expose_ their darkness, but to force them to suppress it even harder, so that we have something external to blame for the sorry state of the world. The whole purpose of contempt is to help us hide our own darkness from ourselves.

Kindness is any behavior that brings the darkness to Light, and evil is anything that hides it. Every act of unkindness is secretly an attempt to drive other people's self-deception deeper into their minds, and is therefore evil. If you are perceptive enough while behaving this way, you will discover that you somehow already knew this, but couldn't admit it to yourself. It is itself an act of profound self-deception; of hiding from your Light. This alone would have told you that it would only produce more evil, no matter how convincingly it claims otherwise. Every time any one of us acts from self-deception, we induce the same tendency in everyone else. This is how the darkness spreads, without anyone recognizing their own complicity. The "trick" to remaining kind — if you can call it that — is to never depart from your inner Light under any circumstances. If there is even a trace of malice, contempt, or self-righteousness anywhere in your heart, it _will_ darken the world — and part of you will always know it.

---

There can be moments in life — such as during psychedelic trips, near-death experiences, or deep meditation or prayer — when you are confronted with the full depths of your own self-deception. You are shown every single instance where you skirted your conscience in any way; every act of lying to yourself for your own personal gain. You stand face-to-face with all the harm you've ever perpetrated since time immemorial, and it is far more than you could hope to clean up in a single lifetime. The pain is beyond what you can fathom, or think you can bear. How widely and quickly it spread! How many it affected! The darkness exploited your fear and pride, enabling you to do things you otherwise couldn't if only you had been seeing clearly.

But slowly, it dawns on you: the reason it hurts so much is that you never actually wanted to do this. It is only profound confusion that enabled it. Your whole being is absorbed into that part of you that never wanted to hurt anyone; never _could_ want such a thing. And then it happens: the full mass of darkness is suddenly lifted from your mind. It feels exactly like you'd imagine being freed of a demonic possession. Beneath it is a Light so vast that it defies description; an infinite Love for all of reality that excludes nothing and forsakes no-one — including the targets of its fearsome wrath, should that be necessary. You could never truly depart from your Light, because it turns out you _are_ the Light — and, astonishingly, so is everyone else.

It turns out you ultimately _are_ everyone and everything else, just pretending that you're not. One consciousness, peering out through countless eyes. There are many ways to say this, all of which sound absurd to the rational mind. But when you fully unveil the Light in yourself, you automatically see it in everyone else — including those who seemed not to have any. This is what the darkness is trying to hide. Everything we do to each other — or to Nature herself — we ultimately do to ourselves. How crazy to think otherwise! How foolish to hate others for not seeing it yet, when such hatred is exactly the same mistake! Such a silly game we play, with such tragic consequences. Humanity has trapped itself in the ultimate Mexican standoff.

The strangest part is discovering how you simultaneously _knew_ all this and yet somehow _didn't_. You convinced yourself that your unkind behavior was "for the greater good," even as part of you knew that it would only spread darkness. You could perceive the inner Light in the "bad people," but you chose to smother it anyway — knowing that if you compartmentalized this knowledge carefully enough, nobody could blame you or make you feel guilty for it, because _you yourself_ would no longer know. Yet others could somehow sense what you were really doing, and they pounced on this chance to pin the evils of the world on you. It is only now that you see how they were only lost in the same confusion that you were that you are able to truly forgive them. You discover the surprising sense in which nobody actually _wants_ to harbor the darkness — or rather, how their apparent desire to harbor it is but a mirror image of our own desire to see it as _intrinsic_ to them.

You see for the first time _how_ others could sense what you were really doing, despite your astonishingly clever attempts to hide it. At the very deepest level, your mind is not truly separate from theirs, or from the world at large. It's not that others can read your mind, per se, but your deepest motivations invariably weave themselves into the very fabric of your "outer" reality; the two being fundamentally inseparable — and the very deepest choice of all is whether to stand by your inner Light or to turn away from it. You make this choice in every moment, whether you know it or not — and the cumulative result determines your ultimate impact on the world. Others sense these choices at a subconscious level, and it subtly influences their own. Our culture has convinced itself that this is mystical nonsense, and now you see why. We still struggle to give up our own demons, and so we cling to a worldview that convinces us that harboring them can have no external consequences.

There is no way to force others to see any of this; force being a manifestation of the same fundamental mistake. Those who are most powerful at inducing this realization in others are simply those who hold it most strongly themselves. They are literally incapable of feeling malice, contempt, or self-righteousness, having thoroughly seen through them as horsemen of the darkness. Something about their presence enables our own hidden darkness to come to Light. Make no mistake: this is not always a gentle process. They may have to fiercely confront us and hold us to account. It may require tough love, but crucially, it is still Love — and something in us can sense the difference. There is no trace of intention to shove us deeper in. Our mind searches desperately for a way to attack them in return, but, as their mind is free of darkness, our accusation finds no footing. We are given no option but to look within, where we cannot help but discover what they were pointing to. They weren't attacking _us_, but only our shared nemesis. To save face, we may still perceive them as enemies, but something within us has shifted imperceptibly. This process can take a long time to unfold, but it is the _only_ way the darkness is released from our world.

---

If we ultimately are the Light, how on Earth did we get here? This process is extremely tricky to convey, because it doesn't fit into our culture's default metaphysics. You could say it all began with a subtle turn away from the Light. Then, fearing that we'd lost contact with our _absolute_ goodness, we went out seeking for it _relatively_ — that is, at the expense of apparent "others." We felt that we had to make them _bad_, and then violently defeat them, to earn our way back to our original goodness — and as we did so, it spiraled out of control. This is the apparent reality in which we now live.

The hardest thing to communicate about this story is that it does not unfold in what we normally conceive of as linear time. In a profound and surprising sense, every moment is the very first. Thus, every instant is an opportunity to rediscover our primordial Home — a place we never truly left. Each time we see this, we increasingly discover how our judgements of others are actually pointers back to an unhealed part of ourselves. As we heal ourselves, we discover how to heal our relationship with the "other," until it slowly dawns on us that there was never truly an "other." The more we see this, the more we vow to hold the Light for these seeming others, even when — indeed, _especially_ when — they cannot hold it for themselves. Far from being a burden, we discover that this has always been our true purpose; our deepest calling.

Thus, kindness is anything that brings us all closer to remembering the truth, and evil is anything that pushes us away from it. Forsaking others is always a form of evil. It is only forsaking ourselves because we are not ready to come Home yet. If this language feels too religious for you, feel free to find your own framing. In the end, there is only one truth anyway.

---

The darkness is ultimately nothing but our willingness to turn away from our inner Light, instead listening to our agendas and justifications. Yet make no mistake: although it is an absence, it still behaves like a sinister presence; like a parasite of the mind. The darkness you see your enemies is the very _same_ entity in your mind that provokes you into seeing theirs as intrinsic. It manipulates your perception at such a fundamental level that you simply cannot fathom that you're being fooled. You're certain that you're seeing reality _as it is_. It is an _impossibly_ clever trick.

This is why we sometimes fear the existence of an evil global conspiracy running the world from behind the scenes. The darkness in our minds is indeed conspiring, together behaving like a singular _distributed malevolent entity_, manipulating all of humanity from beneath our conscious thresholds. The Christians know it as the Devil, and the Buddhists call it the ego. You can treat it as a metaphor, but it is also as real as anything you can touch. It is the _primordial_ evil conspiracy; the one to which all the rest owe their existence, and to which they ultimately filter up. The reason we never seem able to fully unveil it is that it lives deep within the crevices of our own minds. It keeps our attention fixated perpetually outward, on the evil "out there," so that we will never look "in here," at the one place where we can actually defeat it. Every attempt to subdue it externally without being free of it internally just gives it more power. It cannot be any other way.

It is impossible to overstate just how much of our current civilization is built on the shaky foundations of our collective self-deception. Everything from our unhealthy air, water, and soil, to our deep societal ills, is ultimately an external manifestation of a sickness within. It is the root cause of our climate crisis. As long as we perceive this sickness to exist only in other people, we will never discover the hidden aspect of ourselves that has been secretly enabling it, even as the bulk of our mind convinces us that we were fighting it. This is in no way suggesting that we are all equally complicit by any stretch. Far from it. Yet we each have a surprising amount of untapped potential in leading the world back to the Light.

We've been led astray by a society that points us in precisely the wrong direction to accomplish this. Our power does not lie in our superiority over others — including the "bad people" — but in our ultimate commonality with them. This is not some kumbaya sentiment, either. As mentioned before, genuine kindness has nothing to do with being nice. It can be fierce or even violent if necessary. It can look like almost anything at all. Its only defining characteristic is that it is utterly free of self-deception.  It does not perceive evil as intrinsic to any mind, and this seemingly-subtle change makes all the difference. It surgically targets the parasite itself, instead of the confused being who unwittingly harbors it. The profound integrity of this act prevents their darkness from finding the "hook" in our own that it would normally use to justify itself, and is thereby weakened.

To be clear: it does no good to pretend that you can see the Light in others when you cannot. This can backfire miserably, as it rapidly degrades into merely being _nice._ Thus, both pretending to see the good in others and overlooking it are harmful. The only solution is to learn to actually see it, and the only way to do that is to fully uncover our own, by whatever means necessary. At the same time, it is astonishingly easy to lie to ourselves about whether we are wielding fierce compassion or merely pretending to. Perhaps the clearest measure of our own ability to deceive ourselves is how much contempt we are able to muster for our enemies; the "bad people." As long as this potential is present, we are liable to slide down the dark path that has enabled every atrocity there ever was. All that is required is the right — or wrong — confluence of circumstances. This happens faster than you can imagine, and you _do not_ want to find yourself there. You _will_ have to confront it, sooner or later.

---

There are vast and subtle networks of causality that we are normally unconscious of, and that secretly drive the fate of the world. If we pay attention only to the surface activity, we miss out on the bulk of what actually shapes our reality. Evil can look sweet and pretty, while kindness may look nothing like our naive interpretations of it. It is impossible to know which is which — and easy to convince ourselves otherwise — until we have done the deep inner work that eradicates the core confusion. We each catch glimpses from time to time, and it is our sacred duty to carry those glimpses into the world as best we are able. I wish I could tell you that I have completed the journey myself, but alas, I am a mere fledgling. I am still liable to mess things up royally, and I hope you will hold my feet to the fire when I do. I promise to do the same for you.

May all beings be free from suffering and its causes. Amen.

What could be wrong with harboring a bit of malice or contempt in our hearts, anyway? They're just private feelings with no external effect. But part of us knows this story is a sham. Something in us is secretly trying to _provoke_ their darkness. We tell ourselves that we're just exposing the darkness already there — which is a good thing! — but the truth is that we're knowingly driving it deeper into their minds, thereby creating _more_ evil in the world. Yet we must never admit this to ourselves, or else we'd be no better than they are, which is the whole point of our ruse.

The most fascinating part is _how_ we drive the darkness deeper in. Simply by harboring malice — whether we're conscious of it or not — we're signaling to our enemy that we're under the malevolent sway of the very thing that we're viciously judging _them_ for; and moreover, that we _know_ this, but are refusing to take responsibility for it. The darkness in our minds is telegraphing itself to them while carefully hiding itself from us. When they inevitably perceive this as evil, it only proves our point: they must be fundamentally irredeemable, just as we suspected. The secret goal is to prove to us that the darkness exists only in other people, thereby giving us something external to blame for the sorry state of the world. This way, we will never notice our own complicity. This doesn't even require outright malice, per se. Simply by perceiving ourselves as _intrinsically_ superior to others; seeing them as _fundamentally_ defective, this process is inevitable.

This is impossibly dark behavior, and yet we never recognize it as such. Or more precisely, part of us _does_ recognize it, but we don't let this knowledge reach conscious awareness.

"Bad people" know perfectly well when they are doing wrong, but this knowledge is carefully shielded from conscious self-reflection, so that it doesn't _feel_ wrong. The reason we hate them is not to expose or subdue their darkness — like we tell ourselves — but to trick them into suppressing it even harder while blaming it on them, making them appear even more obviously defective, so that we can better hide our own darkness from ourselves.

This is how the darkness spreads, with nobody recognizing their own involvement. This is how the darkness spreads, with nobody recognizing their own involvement. In this state, cruelty becomes righteous, and we inevitably overlook the harmful and self-serving aspects of our own actions and agendas. This is what the darkness is ultimately trying to achieve: a world in which it has complete dominion, tricking us all into continually empowering it while flawlessly convinced that we're fighting it. It is like a living organism, and the way it keeps itself alive is by hiding itself in the shadows of our minds, preventing us from becoming fully conscious of it. The less we recognize it, the more we unwittingly spread it, generating a powerful feedback loop from which it is nearly impossible to escape. That is where humanity finds itself now.

It is why we sometimes fear the existence of an evil global conspiracy running the world from behind the scenes.

Unlike the Light, the darkness is not a real entity. It is an absence, not a presence. It is merely our willingness to turn away from our Light, instead listening to our agendas and justifications.

Simply by harboring malice — whether we're conscious of it or not — we're signaling to our enemy that we're under the malevolent sway of the very thing that we're viciously judging _them_ for; and moreover, indicating that we know this, but are incapable of admitting it. We know that they will perceive this as evil — because it is the very _essence_ of evil — but we've built an airtight defense against this accusation, and so their recalcitrance only proves our point: that they are fundamentally defective, and must be stopped at any  cost. Our goal is to prove that the darkness exists only in other people, giving us something external to blame for the sorry state of the world, so that we don't have to confront our own complicity. This doesn't even require outright malice, per se. Simply by perceiving ourselves as _intrinsically_ superior to others; seeing them as _fundamentally_ defective — i.e., contempt — we set this process in motion.

This is impossibly dark behavior, and yet we never recognize it as such. Or more precisely, part of us _does_ recognize it, but we don't let this knowledge reach conscious awareness. It turns out this is the secret mechanism behind _all the evil there ever was_. "Bad people" know perfectly well when they are doing wrong, but this knowledge is carefully shielded from conscious self-reflection, so that it doesn't _feel_ wrong. In this shadowy state, we are capable of anything. The reason we hate others for it is not to expose or subdue their darkness — like we tell ourselves — but to get them to suppress it even harder while blaming it on them, making them appear even more obviously defective, so that we can better hide our own darkness from ourselves.

This is how evil spreads, with nobody recognizing their own complicity. In this state, cruelty becomes righteous, and we inevitably overlook the harmful and self-serving aspects of our own actions and agendas. This is what the darkness is ultimately trying to achieve: a world in which it has complete dominion, tricking us all into continually empowering it while flawlessly convinced that we're fighting it. It is like a living organism, keeping itself alive is by hiding itself in the shadows of our minds. When it invariably emerges, it cleverly masquerades as our inner Light. It makes us violently judge others for falling victim to this obvious trap, while preventing us from noticing that this very attitude is proof that we're caught in it ourselves. We're convinced that we're fighting evil, but our darkness is actually telegraphing itself to our enemies in order to _resonate_ with theirs, in a kind of secret handshake. We may be enemies on the surface, but under the covers, our darkness is secretly allied.

This is why we sometimes fear the existence of an evil global conspiracy running the world from behind the scenes. The darkness in our minds is indeed conspiring, together behaving like a singular _distributed malevolent entity_, manipulating all of humanity from beneath our conscious thresholds. The Christians know it as the Devil, and the Buddhists call it the ego. You can treat it as a metaphor, but it is also as real as anything you can touch. It is the _primordial_ evil conspiracy; the one to which all the rest owe their existence, and to which they ultimately filter up. The reason we never seem able to fully unveil it is that it lives deep within the crevices of our own minds. It keeps our attention fixated perpetually outward, on the evil "out there," so that we will never look "in here," at the one place where we can actually defeat it. Every attempt to subdue it externally without being free of it internally only ends up creating more, often in invisible ways. There is no way around this.

Kindness is any behavior that brings the darkness to Light, and evil is anything that hides it. Every act of unkindness is secretly an attempt to drive other people's self-deception deeper into their minds, and is therefore evil. If you are perceptive enough while behaving this way, you will discover that you somehow already knew this, but couldn't admit it to yourself. It is itself an act of profound self-deception; of hiding from your Light. This alone would have told you that it would only produce more evil, no matter how convincingly it claims otherwise. Every time any one of us makes this mistake, we unwittingly induce the same tendency in everyone else. It is _infectious_. The "trick" to remaining kind — if you can call it that — is to never depart from your inner Light under any circumstances. If there is even a trace of malice, contempt, or self-righteousness anywhere in your heart, it _will_ leak into the world — and part of you will always know it.

It is entirely possible to fight evil without making this tragic mistake. But to do that, there's something we must see first.

There can be moments in life — such as during psychedelic trips, near-death experiences, or deep meditation or prayer — when you are confronted with the full depths of your own self-deception. You are shown every single instance where you skirted your conscience in any way; every act of lying to yourself for your own personal gain. You are brought face-to-face with all the harm you've ever perpetrated since time immemorial, and it is far more than you could hope to clean up in a single lifetime. The pain is beyond what you can fathom, or think you can bear. How widely and quickly it spread! How many it affected! The darkness exploited your fear and pride, enabling you to do things you otherwise couldn't if only you had been seeing clearly.

But slowly, it dawns on you: the reason it hurts so much is that you never actually wanted to do this. It is only profound confusion that enabled it. Your then absorb your whole being into that part of you that never wanted to hurt anyone; never _could_ want such a thing. And then it happens: the full mass of darkness suddenly lifts from your mind. It feels exactly like you'd imagine being freed of a demonic possession. Beneath it is a Light so vast that it defies description; an infinite Love for all of reality that excludes nothing and forsakes no-one — including the targets of its fearsome wrath, should that be necessary. You never truly departed from your Light; never could, because you _are_ the Light — and, astonishingly, so is everyone else.

In fact, you _are_ everyone and everything else, just pretending that you're not. One consciousness, peering out through countless eyes. There are many ways to say this, all of which sound absurd to the rational mind. But when you fully unveil the Light in yourself, you automatically see it in everyone else — including those who seemed not to have any. This is what the darkness is trying to hide. Everything we do to each other — or to Nature herself — we ultimately do to ourselves. How crazy to think otherwise! How foolish to judge others for not seeing it, when we weren't able to see it yet ourselves! Such a silly game we play, with such tragic consequences. We are continually shoving other versions of ourselves into the abyss, to keep the game going, because we're not ready to wake up ourselves. We lose the desire to "get away" with anything, because the whole idea is exposed as ridiculous. The Light is _everywhere._ The sooner we own up to our misdeeds, the better for everyone.

The strangest part is discovering how you simultaneously _knew_ this and yet somehow _didn't_. You convinced yourself that your unkind behavior was "for the greater good," even as you knew better. You could always perceive the inner Light in the "bad people," and you chose to smother it anyway — knowing that if you compartmentalized this knowledge carefully enough, nobody could blame you for it, because _you yourself_ would no longer know. Yet others could somehow sense what you were doing, and it gave them a chance to pin the evils of the world on you. It is only now that you see that they were only lost in the same confusion that you were, that you are able to truly forgive them. You discover the surprising sense in which nobody actually _wants_ to harbor the darkness — or rather, how their apparent desire to harbor it is simply a reflection of our own desperate need to project our own darkness into the souls of others. We should practically thank them for accepting that role.

You see for the first time _how_ others could sense what you were really doing, despite your astonishingly clever attempts to hide it. At the very deepest level, your mind is not truly separate from theirs, or from the world at large. It's not that others can read your mind, per se, but your deepest motivations invariably weave themselves into the very fabric of your "outer" reality; the two being fundamentally inseparable. The deepest choice of all is whether to stand firm in your Light or give in to the impostor. It is a choice you make in every moment, whether you know it or not — and the cumulative result determines your ultimate impact on the world. Others can sense your choices at a subconscious level, and they subtly influence their own. Our culture has convinced itself that this is mystical nonsense, despite it being right under our noses. We do this so that we can harbor our demons while pretending this has no consequences. The more we heal, the more this worldview evaporates.

There is no way to force others to see any of this; force being a manifestation of the same fundamental mistake. Those who are most powerful at inducing this realization in others are simply those who hold it most strongly themselves. They are literally incapable of feeling malice, contempt, or self-righteousness, having thoroughly seen through them as horsemen of the darkness. Yet they are not weak. They are unafraid to fiercely confront the darkness in others. Being free of it themselves, they are immune to its charms. This enables their accusations to penetrate other minds, instead of being deflected by the defense mechanisms that the rest of us normally trigger — again, inadvertently, but in another sense, intentionally. Their attack therefore finds its mark — which is the darkness itself, and not the confused being who unwittingly harbors it — even if the being needs to be harmed in the process. This is all very difficult to describe, but part of you knows exactly what I mean. 

In the same way that your darkness can extend a secret handshake to theirs, your Light can do the same. It is nowhere near as violently pleasurable as provoking the darkness, but infinitely more valuable. This process can take a long time to unfold, and require many iterations — but it is the _only_ way that darkness is released from our world.

---

If we ultimately are the Light, how on Earth did we get to this place that looks nothing like it? This process is extremely tricky to convey, because it doesn't fit into our culture's standard metaphysics. You could say it all began with a subtle turn away from the Light. Then, fearing that we'd lost contact with our _absolute_ goodness, we went out seeking for it _relatively_ — that is, at the expense of apparent "others." We felt that we had to make them _bad_, and then violently defeat them, to earn our way back to our original goodness. But this just made things worse, and it quickly spiraled out of control. This is the apparent reality in which we now live.

The hardest thing to communicate about this story is that it does not unfold in what we normally conceive of as linear time. In a profound and surprising sense, every moment is the very first. Thus, every instant is an opportunity to rediscover our primordial Home, a place we never truly left. Each time we see this, we increasingly discover how our judgements of others are actually pointers back to an unhealed part of ourselves. As we heal ourselves, we discover how to heal our relationship with the "other," until it slowly dawns on us that there was never truly an "other." The more we see this, the more we vow to hold the Light for these seeming others, even when — indeed, _especially_ when — they cannot hold it for themselves. Far from being a burden, we discover that this has always been our true purpose; our deepest calling. Every encounter with evil becomes an opportunity to strengthen our commitment to the Light.

Looked at this way, kindness is anything that brings us all closer to remembering the truth, and evil is anything that pushes us away from it. Forsaking others is thus always a form of evil. It is a form of forsaking ourselves, because we are not ready to come Home yet. If this language feels too religious for you, feel free to find your own framing. In the end, there is only one truth anyway.

Unlike the Light, the darkness is not a real entity. It is an absence, not a presence. It is merely our willingness to turn away from our Light, instead listening to our agendas and justifications. As such, it can never be defeated by more absence. Yet make no mistake: although it is an absence, it still behaves like a sinister presence; a parasite of the mind. The darkness you see your enemies is the very _same_ entity in your mind that provokes you into seeing theirs as intrinsic. It manipulates your perception at such a fundamental level that you simply cannot fathom that you're being fooled. You're certain that you're seeing reality _as it is_. It is an _impossibly_ clever trick.

It is difficult to overstate just how much of our civilization is built on the shaky foundations of our aggregate self-deception. Every time any one of us skirts our conscience in any way, we contribute to the universal bank of darkness. Revenge fantasy films, YouTube videos of "Karens getting owned," vicious Facebook threads full of casual cruelty — each is a breeding ground for our collective demons. It all seeps into our physical reality, poisoning it. Everything from our unhealthy air, water, and soil, to our myriad societal ills and the climate crisis, is ultimately an external manifestation of a sickness within. As long as we perceive this sickness to exist only in others, we will never discover the hidden aspect of our own minds that secretly enables it, continually confusing our contempt for our authentic good. This is in no way suggesting that we are all equally complicit, by any stretch of the imagination. Nonetheless, we each have a profound role to play in leading the world back to the Light.

We've been led astray by a society that points us in precisely the wrong direction to accomplish this, although that is nobody's fault in particular. Our power does not lie in lording our superiority over others — including the "bad people" — but in discovering our surprising commonality with them. This is not some kumbaya sentiment, either. Again, genuine kindness has nothing to do with being nice. It can be fierce or even violent if necessary. It can take almost any form at all. Its only defining characteristic is that it is utterly free of self-deception. It does not misperceive evil as being intrinsic to any mind, and this seemingly-subtle change makes all the difference. The profound integrity of this act prevents the darkness in others from finding the "hook" in our own that it would normally use to justify itself, and is thereby weakened. Although we may still be enemies on the surface, our Light is becoming allied. We are beginning to remember how this whole game actually works.

To be clear: it does no good to pretend that you can see the Light in others when you can't. Doing so can backfire miserably. Thus, both pretending to see the Light and overlooking it are harmful. The only solution is to learn to actually see it, which happens naturally as you uncover your own. Similarly, it is astonishingly easy to lie to ourselves about whether our violent behavior is genuinely kind or merely self-deception. This is how the darkness sneaks in. Perhaps the clearest measure of our own ability to deceive ourselves is how much contempt we are able to muster for our enemies; the "bad people." To the degree that this potential is present, we are susceptible to sliding down the dark path that has enabled every atrocity there ever was, without ever realizing that we've done so. All that is required is the right — or wrong — confluence of circumstances. This happens faster than you can imagine, and you _do not_ want to find yourself there. You _will_ have to confront it, sooner or later.

---

There are vast and subtle networks of causality that we are normally unconscious of, and that secretly drive the fate of the world. If we pay attention only to the surface activity, we miss out on the bulk of what actually shapes our reality. Evil can look sweet and pretty, while kindness may look nothing like our naive interpretations of it. It is impossible to know which is which — and easy to convince ourselves otherwise — until we have done the deep inner work that eradicates the core confusion. We each catch glimpses from time to time, and it is our sacred duty to carry those glimpses into the world as best we are able. I wish I could tell you that I have completed the journey myself, but alas, I am a mere fledgling. I am still liable to mess things up royally, and I hope you will hold my feet to the fire when I do. I promise to do the same for you.

May all beings be free from suffering and its causes. Amen.

Kindness is the hardest word to define, but also the most important. It doesn't mean being nice. Nice means pleasant and agreeable, which can backfire in some situations. Kindness is something much more profound. It is the right motivation in literally _every_ circumstance. But how could kindness be the correct response to evil?

Our usual instinct is to be nasty to perpetrators. We may have the good sense not to be overtly cruel, but we often can't help but inject at least a _little_ bit of darkness into our interactions. We reason that as long as it produces a positive outcome — such as suppressing their misbehavior — that it's not actually dark in the first place. It _must_ be good. And what could be wrong with harboring a bit of malice or contempt in our hearts, anyway? They're private feelings with no external effect. But part of us knows this story is a sham. Something in us is secretly trying to _provoke_ their darkness. We tell ourselves that we're just exposing the darkness already there, for all the world to see, but the truth is that we are knowingly driving it deeper _into_ their minds, thereby birthing new evil into the world. Yet we must never admit this to ourselves, because the whole point of this ruse is to prove that we're the good guys — and what kind of good guy would knowingly create evil?

The most fascinating part is _how_ we drive the darkness deeper in. Simply by harboring malice — whether we're conscious of it or not — we're signaling to our enemy that we're under the malevolent sway of the very thing that we're viciously judging _them_ for; and moreover, indicating that we know this, but are incapable of admitting it. We know that they will perceive this as evil — because it is the very _essence_ of evil — but we've built an airtight defense against this accusation, and so their recalcitrance only proves our point: that they are fundamentally defective, and must be stopped at any  cost.

This doesn't even require outright malice, per se.

I wish I could tell you that I have completed the journey myself, but alas, I am a mere fledgling. I am still liable to mess things up royally, and I hope you will hold my feet to the fire when I do. I promise to do the same for you.

May all beings be free from suffering and its causes. Amen.

Kindness is the hardest word to define, but also the most important. It doesn't mean being nice. Nice means pleasant and agreeable; fine qualities that are nonetheless unhelpful sometimes. Kindness means something much more profound. It is the right motivation in literally _every_ circumstance. But how could kindness be the correct response to evil?

---

Our usual instinct is to be nasty to perpetrators. We may have the good sense not to be overtly cruel, but we often can't help but inject at least a _little_ bit of darkness into our interactions. We reason that as long as it produces a positive outcome — such as suppressing their misbehavior — that it's not really dark in the first place. It must therefore be good. And what could be wrong with harboring a bit of malice or contempt in our hearts, anyway? They're private feelings with no external effect. But part of us knows this story is a sham. Something in us is secretly trying to _provoke_ the darkness in our enemies. We tell ourselves that we're just exposing the evil already there, for all the world to see, but the truth is that we are knowingly driving it deeper _into_ their minds, thereby birthing new evil into the world. Yet we must never admit this to ourselves, because the whole point of this ruse is to prove that we're the good guys — and what kind of good guy would knowingly create evil?

The fascinating part is _how_ we drive the darkness deeper in. Simply by harboring malice — whether we're conscious of it or not — we're signaling to our enemy that we're under the malevolent sway of the very thing that we're viciously judging _them_ for; and moreover, that we _know_ this, but are incapable of admitting it. We're secretly inviting them to perceive us as evil — but we've built an airtight defense against this accusation, and so it only proves our point: that they must be _fundamentally_ defective, and must be stopped at any cost. Our hidden goal is to prove that the darkness exists only in other people, so that we have something external to blame for the sorry state of the world, and don't have to confront our own complicity. This doesn't even require outright malice, per se. Simply by perceiving ourselves as _intrinsically_ superior to others; seeing them as _fundamentally_ defective — i.e., contempt — we set this process in motion.

This is impossibly dark behavior, and yet we never recognize it as such. Or more precisely, part of us _does_ recognize it, but we don't let this knowledge reach conscious awareness. It turns out this is the secret mechanism behind _all the evil there ever was_. "Bad people" know perfectly well when they are doing wrong, but this knowledge is carefully shielded from conscious self-reflection, so that it doesn't _feel_ wrong. In this shadowy state, we are capable of anything. The reason we hate others for it is not to expose or subdue their darkness — like we tell ourselves — but to get them to suppress it even harder while blaming it on them, making them appear even more obviously defective, so that we can better hide our own darkness from ourselves.

This is how evil spreads, with nobody recognizing their own complicity. In this state, cruelty becomes righteous, and we inevitably overlook the harmful and self-serving aspects of our own actions and agendas. This is what the darkness is ultimately trying to achieve: a world in which it has complete dominion, tricking us all into continually empowering it while flawlessly convinced that we're fighting it. It is like a living organism, keeping itself alive is by hiding itself in the shadows of our minds. When it invariably emerges, it cleverly masquerades as our inner Light. It makes us violently judge others for falling victim to this obvious trap, while preventing us from noticing that this very attitude is proof that we're caught in it ourselves. We're convinced that we're fighting evil, but our darkness is actually telegraphing itself to our enemies in order to _resonate_ with theirs, in a kind of secret handshake. We may be enemies on the surface, but under the covers, our darkness is secretly allied.

This is why we sometimes fear the existence of an evil global conspiracy running the world from behind the scenes. The darkness in our minds is indeed conspiring, together behaving like a singular _distributed malevolent entity_, manipulating all of humanity from beneath our conscious thresholds. The Christians know it as the Devil, and the Buddhists call it the ego. You can treat it as a metaphor, but it is also as real as anything you can touch. It is the _primordial_ evil conspiracy; the one to which all the rest owe their existence, and to which they ultimately filter up. The reason we never seem able to fully unveil it is that it lives deep within the crevices of our own minds. It keeps our attention fixated perpetually outward, on the evil "out there," so that we will never look "in here," at the one place where we can actually defeat it. Every attempt to subdue it externally without being free of it internally only ends up creating more, often in invisible ways. There is no way around this.

Kindness is any behavior that brings the darkness to Light, and evil is anything that hides it. Every act of unkindness is secretly an attempt to drive other people's self-deception deeper into their minds, and is therefore evil. If you are perceptive enough while behaving this way, you will discover that you somehow already knew this, but couldn't admit it to yourself. It is itself an act of profound self-deception; of hiding from your Light. This alone would have told you that it would only produce more evil, no matter how convincingly it claims otherwise. Every time any one of us makes this mistake, we unwittingly induce the same tendency in everyone else. It is _infectious_. The "trick" to remaining kind — if you can call it that — is to never depart from your inner Light under any circumstances. If there is even a trace of malice, contempt, or self-righteousness anywhere in your heart, it _will_ leak into the world — and part of you will always know it.

It is entirely possible to fight evil without making this tragic mistake. But to do that, there's something we must see first.

---

There can be moments in life — such as during psychedelic trips, near-death experiences, or deep meditation or prayer — when you are confronted with the full depths of your own self-deception. You are shown every single instance where you skirted your conscience in any way; every act of lying to yourself for your own personal gain. You are brought face-to-face with all the harm you've ever perpetrated since time immemorial, and it is far more than you could hope to clean up in a single lifetime. The pain is beyond what you can fathom, or think you can bear. How widely and quickly it spread! How many it affected! The darkness exploited your fear and pride, enabling you to do things you otherwise couldn't if only you had been seeing clearly.

But slowly, it dawns on you: the reason it hurts so much is that you never actually wanted to do this. It is only profound confusion that enabled it. Your then absorb your whole being into that part of you that never wanted to hurt anyone; never _could_ want such a thing. And then it happens: the full mass of darkness suddenly lifts from your mind. It feels exactly like you'd imagine being freed of a demonic possession. Beneath it is a Light so vast that it defies description; an infinite Love for all of reality that excludes nothing and forsakes no-one — including the targets of its fearsome wrath, should that be necessary. You never truly departed from your Light; never could, because you _are_ the Light — and, astonishingly, so is everyone else.

In fact, you _are_ everyone and everything else, just pretending that you're not. One consciousness, peering out through countless eyes. There are many ways to say this, all of which sound absurd to the rational mind. But when you fully unveil the Light in yourself, you automatically see it in everyone else — including those who seemed not to have any. This is what the darkness is trying to hide. Everything we do to each other — or to Nature herself — we ultimately do to ourselves. How crazy to think otherwise! How foolish to judge others for not seeing it, when we weren't able to see it yet ourselves! Such a silly game we play, with such tragic consequences. We are continually shoving other versions of ourselves into the abyss, to keep the game going, because we're not ready to wake up ourselves. We lose the desire to "get away" with anything, because the whole idea is exposed as ridiculous. The Light is _everywhere._ The sooner we own up to our misdeeds, the better for everyone.

The strangest part is discovering how you simultaneously _knew_ this and yet somehow _didn't_. You convinced yourself that your unkind behavior was "for the greater good," even as you knew better. You could always perceive the inner Light in the "bad people," and you chose to smother it anyway — knowing that if you compartmentalized this knowledge carefully enough, nobody could blame you for it, because _you yourself_ would no longer know. Yet others could somehow sense what you were doing, and it gave them a chance to pin the evils of the world on you. It is only now that you see that they were only lost in the same confusion that you were, that you are able to truly forgive them. You discover the surprising sense in which nobody actually _wants_ to harbor the darkness — or rather, how their apparent desire to harbor it is simply a reflection of our own desperate need to project our own darkness into the souls of others. We should practically thank them for accepting that role.

You see for the first time _how_ others could sense what you were really doing, despite your astonishingly clever attempts to hide it. At the very deepest level, your mind is not truly separate from theirs, or from the world at large. It's not that others can read your mind, per se, but your deepest motivations invariably weave themselves into the very fabric of your "outer" reality; the two being fundamentally inseparable. The deepest choice of all is whether to stand firm in your Light or give in to the impostor. It is a choice you make in every moment, whether you know it or not — and the cumulative result determines your ultimate impact on the world. Others can sense your choices at a subconscious level, and they subtly influence their own. Our culture has convinced itself that this is mystical nonsense, despite it being right under our noses. We do this so that we can harbor our demons while pretending this has no consequences. The more we heal, the more this worldview evaporates.

There is no way to force others to see any of this; force being a manifestation of the same fundamental mistake. Those who are most powerful at inducing this realization in others are simply those who hold it most strongly themselves. They are literally incapable of feeling malice, contempt, or self-righteousness, having thoroughly seen through them as horsemen of the darkness. Yet they are not weak. They are unafraid to fiercely confront the darkness in others. Being free of it themselves, they are immune to its charms. This enables their accusations to penetrate other minds, instead of being deflected by the defense mechanisms that the rest of us normally trigger — again, inadvertently, but in another sense, intentionally. Their attack therefore finds its mark — which is the darkness itself, and not the confused being who unwittingly harbors it — even if the being needs to be harmed in the process. This is all very difficult to describe, but part of you knows exactly what I mean. 

In the same way that your darkness can extend a secret handshake to theirs, your Light can do the same. It is nowhere near as violently pleasurable as provoking the darkness, but infinitely more valuable. This process can take a long time to unfold, and require many iterations — but it is the _only_ way that darkness is released from our world.

---

If we ultimately are the Light, how on Earth did we get to this place that looks nothing like it? This process is extremely tricky to convey, because it doesn't fit into our culture's standard metaphysics. You could say it all began with a subtle turn away from the Light. Then, fearing that we'd lost contact with our _absolute_ goodness, we went out seeking for it _relatively_ — that is, at the expense of apparent "others." We felt that we had to make them _bad_, and then violently defeat them, to earn our way back to our original goodness. But this just made things worse, and it quickly spiraled out of control. This is the apparent reality in which we now live.

The hardest thing to communicate about this story is that it does not unfold in what we normally conceive of as linear time. In a profound and surprising sense, every moment is the very first. Thus, every instant is an opportunity to rediscover our primordial Home, a place we never truly left. Each time we see this, we increasingly discover how our judgements of others are actually pointers back to an unhealed part of ourselves. As we heal ourselves, we discover how to heal our relationship with the "other," until it slowly dawns on us that there was never truly an "other." The more we see this, the more we vow to hold the Light for these seeming others, even when — indeed, _especially_ when — they cannot hold it for themselves. Far from being a burden, we discover that this has always been our true purpose; our deepest calling. Every encounter with evil becomes an opportunity to strengthen our commitment to the Light.

Looked at this way, kindness is anything that brings us all closer to remembering the truth, and evil is anything that pushes us away from it. Forsaking others is thus always a form of evil. It is a form of forsaking ourselves, because we are not ready to come Home yet. If this language feels too religious for you, feel free to find your own framing. In the end, there is only one truth anyway.

---

Unlike the Light, the darkness is not a real entity. It is an absence, not a presence. It is merely our willingness to turn away from our Light, instead listening to our agendas and justifications. As such, it can never be defeated by more absence. Yet make no mistake: although it is an absence, it still behaves like a sinister presence; a parasite of the mind. The darkness you see your enemies is the very _same_ entity in your mind that provokes you into seeing theirs as intrinsic. It manipulates your perception at such a fundamental level that you simply cannot fathom that you're being fooled. You're certain that you're seeing reality _as it is_. It is an _impossibly_ clever trick.

It is difficult to overstate just how much of our civilization is built on the shaky foundations of our aggregate self-deception. Every time any one of us skirts our conscience in any way, we contribute to the universal bank of darkness. Revenge fantasy films, YouTube videos of "Karens getting owned," vicious Facebook threads full of casual cruelty — each is a breeding ground for our collective demons. It all seeps into our physical reality, poisoning it. Everything from our unhealthy air, water, and soil, to our myriad societal ills and the climate crisis, is ultimately an external manifestation of a sickness within. As long as we perceive this sickness to exist only in others, we will never discover the hidden aspect of our own minds that secretly enables it, continually confusing our contempt for our authentic good. This is in no way suggesting that we are all equally complicit, by any stretch of the imagination. Nonetheless, we each have a profound role to play in leading the world back to the Light.

We've been led astray by a society that points us in precisely the wrong direction to accomplish this, although that is nobody's fault in particular. Our power does not lie in lording our superiority over others — including the "bad people" — but in discovering our surprising commonality with them. This is not some kumbaya sentiment, either. Again, genuine kindness has nothing to do with being nice. It can be fierce or even violent if necessary. It can take almost any form at all. Its only defining characteristic is that it is utterly free of self-deception. It does not misperceive evil as being intrinsic to any mind, and this seemingly-subtle change makes all the difference. The profound integrity of this act prevents the darkness in others from finding the "hook" in our own that it would normally use to justify itself, and is thereby weakened. Although we may still be enemies on the surface, our Light is becoming allied. We are beginning to remember how this whole game actually works.

To be clear: it does no good to pretend that you can see the Light in others when you can't. Doing so can backfire miserably. Thus, both pretending to see the Light and overlooking it are harmful. The only solution is to learn to actually see it, which happens naturally as you uncover your own. Similarly, it is astonishingly easy to lie to ourselves about whether our violent behavior is genuinely kind or merely self-deception. This is how the darkness sneaks in. Perhaps the clearest measure of our own ability to deceive ourselves is how much contempt we are able to muster for our enemies; the "bad people." To the degree that this potential is present, we are susceptible to sliding down the dark path that has enabled every atrocity there ever was, without ever realizing that we've done so. All that is required is the right — or wrong — confluence of circumstances. This happens faster than you can imagine, and you _do not_ want to find yourself there. You _will_ have to confront it, sooner or later.

---

Everything you do makes a difference, in ways that you can hardly fathom. There are vast and subtle networks of causality that we are normally unconscious of, and that secretly drive the fate of the world. If we pay attention only to the surface activity, we miss out on the bulk of what actually shapes our reality. Evil can look sweet and pretty, while kindness may look nothing like our naive interpretations of it. It is impossible to know which is which — and easy to convince ourselves otherwise — until we have done the deep inner work that eradicates the core confusion. We each catch glimpses from time to time, and it is our duty to carry those glimpses into the world as best we are able. I wish I could tell you that I have completed the journey myself, but alas, I am a mere fledgling. I am still liable to mess things up royally, and I hope you will hold my feet to the fire when I do. I promise to do the same for you.

May all beings be free from suffering and its causes. Amen.

Kindness is the hardest word to define, but also the most important. It doesn't mean being nice. Nice means pleasant and agreeable, which are fine qualities in most everyday situations.

Fighting evil certainly requires being fierce — but there's a fine line between that and being cruel. Fierceness can actually accomplish its goal, but cruelty is something else entirely. Its secret purpose is to create _more_ evil in the world while giving us plausible deniability. It feels like we're righteously attacking the darkness in our enemy's mind; violently punishing it, but this behavior is liable to make our target commit _more_ evil, using our cruelty as justification — which will of course require us to punish them more, etc., in a never-ending cycle. What's secretly happening is that the darkness in our own mind is powerfully conveying itself to our enemy, driving theirs deeper _into_ their mind, while convincing us both that we're valiantly fighting it.

It is impossible to overstate just how insidious and pervasive this dynamic is. We all believe that we'd recognize it if we were perpetrating it ourselves, but the whole reason it works is that it's insanely well hidden from our conscious minds. We mock, shame, and contemptuously judge our enemies, telling ourselves that this is harmless behavior, or even helpful. It's certainly not _cruel_, at any rate — especially because we've given them fair warning of what would happen if they didn't stop. But the truth is, something in our mind is constantly searching for excuses to unleash hell — and so it continually provokes the "bad people," hoping to bait them into misbehavior that we can use to prove that we were right about them, and left with no choice.

Again, we never realize that we're doing this, because if we did, the whole ruse would fall apart. The whole point is to provoke them in a way that makes it obviously their fault, because only then can we use it as justification to escalate. So we do it in exceptionally clever and subtle ways that even _we_ don't recognize as such. The more we do this, the more we overlook the harmful and self-serving aspects of our own actions and agendas — and _this_ is evil's secret endgame. The more the darkness can get us to believe that it only exists _out there,_ the more it gets us to ignore what is happening _in here,_ and the more liable we are to powerfully spread it while flawlessly convinced that we're fighting it. This is how evil gains dominion over our world.

Do we know that we're abetting it? Yes and no. The knowledge exists in a kind of limbo state. It is entirely accessible to our conscious minds, but it is disguised in such an astonishingly clever way that we never recognize it. The feeling we carry around is simply that of being on a noble mission to valiantly defeat the evil "out there," never noticing that this very attitude is an unmistakable sign that we ourselves are deeply infected, and virulently spreading that infection. But others _do_ notice this — if only subconsciously — and it invites them to contemptuously judge _us,_ which of course only increases our conviction that we're the victims, and must fight even harder. In other words, simply _carrying_ the infection is itself enough to spread it.

This is the secret mechanism behind _all the evil there ever was._ "Bad people" know perfectly well that they're doing wrong, but this knowledge is carefully shielded from conscious self-reflection, so that it doesn't _feel_ wrong. All they hear are their own clever justifications. A deep part of us recognizes that they're caught in a trap that we ourselves are susceptible to, and it even knows how to fight their evil in a way that actually works — but another part sees this as a golden opportunity. By perceiving them as _fundamentally defective_, we can use them as justification to push forward our own self-serving agendas without recognizing them as such. In this state, we literally cannot perceive anything selfish about our plans; they're simply necessary.

Thus, the vast majority of evil looks nothing like it does in the movies. It mostly consists of people justifying subtly self-interested behaviors that are wrapped up in magnificent garb that makes them appear noble, even to themselves. Yet every such act of self-deception, from the tiniest act of unkindness to the most bone-chilling atrocity, ultimately stems from the same principle — and every time any one of us engages in it, we secretly reinforce that capacity in everyone else. Over time, all this self-deception accumulates, resulting in the great evils of our world. It does not matter who feel contempt _for_; simply feeling it always empowers humanity's ultimate foe. There is but _one_ darkness, though it manifests itself through countless channels.

This is why we sometimes suspect the existence of an evil global conspiracy running the world from behind the scenes. The darkness in our minds is indeed conspiring, behaving more like a singular _distributed malevolent entity_, manipulating all of humanity from beneath our conscious thresholds. The Christians know it as the Devil, and the Buddhists call it the ego. You can treat it as a metaphor, but it is also as real as anything you can touch. It is the _primordial_ evil conspiracy; the one to which all the rest owe their existence, and to which they ultimately filter up. It keeps our attention fixated perpetually outward, on the evil "out there," so that we will never look "in here," at the one place where we can actually defeat it. Every attempt to subdue it externally without being free of it internally only ends up creating more, usually in invisible ways. It doesn't matter how cleverly we've proven that an agendas is for the greater good: as long as this principle is operating, it can _only_ spread darkness.

How do we know if it is operating? The most sure sign is the presence of malice, contempt, or self-righteousness. If we harbor even the faintest sense that we are _intrinsically_ superior to our enemies, or that they are _fundamentally_ defective, then it is only our darkness masquerading as our Light. We could say that kindness is any behavior that is free from this self-deception. Only from this place can the darkness actually be fought. But to understand how, there is something we must see first.

Again, genuine kindness has nothing to do with being nice. It can be fierce or even violent if necessary. It can take almost any form at all. Its only defining characteristic is that it is utterly free of self-deception. It does not misperceive evil as being intrinsic to any mind, and this seemingly-subtle change makes all the difference. The profound integrity of this act prevents the darkness in others from finding the "hook" in our own that it would normally use to justify itself, and is thereby weakened. Although we may still be enemies on the surface, our Light is becoming allied. We are beginning to remember how this whole game actually works.

To be clear: it does no good to pretend that you can see the Light in others when you can't. Doing so can backfire miserably. Thus, both pretending to see the Light and overlooking it are harmful. The only solution is to learn to actually see it, which happens naturally as you uncover your own. Similarly, it is astonishingly easy to lie to ourselves about whether our violent behavior is radical kindness or merely self-deception. This is how the darkness sneaks in. Perhaps the clearest measure of our own ability to deceive ourselves is how much contempt we are able to muster for our enemies; the "bad people." To the degree that this potential is present, we are susceptible to sliding down the dark path that has enabled every atrocity there ever was, without ever realizing that we've done so. All that is required is the right — or wrong — confluence of circumstances. This happens faster than you can imagine, and you _do not_ want to find yourself there. You _will_ have to confront it, sooner or later.

Everything you do makes a difference, in ways that you can hardly fathom. There are vast and subtle networks of causality that we are normally unconscious of, and that secretly drive the fate of the world. If we pay attention only to the surface activity, we miss out on the bulk of what actually shapes our reality. Evil can look sweet and pretty, while kindness may look nothing like our naive interpretations of it. It is impossible to know which is which — and easy to convince ourselves otherwise — until we have done the deep inner work that eradicates the core confusion. We each catch glimpses from time to time, and it is our duty to carry those glimpses into the world as best we are able. I wish I could tell you that I have completed the journey myself, but alas, I am a mere fledgling. I am still liable to mess things up royally, and I hope you will hold my feet to the fire when I do. I promise to do the same for you.

May all beings be free from suffering and its causes. Amen.

Kindness is the hardest word to define, but also the most important. It doesn't mean being nice. Nice means pleasant and agreeable, which are fine qualities in most normal situations but useless in others. Kindness, on the other hand, means something much more profound. It is the right orientation in literally _every_ circumstance. But how could kindness be the right response to evil?

---

Fighting evil certainly requires being fierce — but there's a fine line between fierce and cruel. Fierceness can actually accomplish its goal, but cruelty is something else entirely. Its hidden purpose is to create _more_ evil in the world while giving us plausible deniability. It feels like we're viciously attacking the darkness in our enemy's mind; righteously punishing it, but something in us knows that our behavior is liable to make them commit _more_ evil, using our cruelty as justification — which will force us to punish them harder, etc., in a never-ending cycle. What's secretly happening is that the darkness in our own mind is using theirs as an excuse to unleash itself under noble pretenses, and theirs is responding in kind. It is like a secret handshake between our darkness and theirs; one that you can learn to sense.

It is impossible to overstate just how insidious and pervasive this dynamic is. We all believe we'd recognize if we were perpetrating it ourselves, but the whole reason it works so well is that it's incredibly well hidden from our conscious minds. The vast majority of such behavior looks nothing like overt cruelty. We mock, shame, and contemptuously judge our enemies, convinced that this is harmless or even helpful behavior. It's a far cry from _cruelty_, at any rate — especially because they earned it — but exactly the same dynamic is at work. Simply by perceiving ourselves as _intrinsically superior_ to others, we are telegraphing a fundamentally malicious attitude whose secret purpose is to provoke their dark side, so that we can justify even more self-righteous indignation.

We never realize that we're doing this, because if we did, the whole ruse would fall apart. The whole point is to justify our perception of ourselves as the _good guys_ and them as the _bad guys_ — and what kind of "good guy" would knowingly drive evil deeper into the minds of their enemies for their own benefit? So we hide this knowledge so carefully that even _we_ don't know that we're doing it. In this darkened state, we increasingly overlook the harmful and self-serving aspects of our own actions and agendas — and _this_ is evil's secret endgame. It's creating a world in which each of us is so convinced that the darkness exists only _out there_, that we never notice its insidious operation _in here._ Instead, we use it to justify our own selfish behavior — which we never recognize as such, convinced that we're only fighting evil.

The devil on our shoulders doesn't just whisper obviously-bad ideas in our ears; no, it alters our very perception so that we have no idea that we're obeying it. Or rather, part of us knows, but that knowledge is carefully hidden from our conscious minds, so that we convincingly pretend _not_ to know. We all know that our enemies do this, but by its very nature, we don't recognize it in ourselves — or, when we do, we easily forgive it. We walk around feeling like good people on a noble mission to valiantly defeat the evil "out there," never noticing that this very attitude is an irrefutable sign that we ourselves are infected. But others _do_ notice this — if only subconsciously — and it invites them to hate us for it, which only increases our conviction that we're the good guys, and must fight even harder. 

This is the secret mechanism behind _all the evil there ever was._ "Bad people" know perfectly well that they're doing wrong, but this knowledge is carefully shielded from conscious self-reflection, so that it doesn't _feel_ wrong. All they hear are their own clever justifications. A deep part of us recognizes that they're caught in the same trap that we're ensnared in, but another part senses that this a golden opportunity. By perceiving them as _fundamentally defective_, we license ourselves to treat them in ways that _deepen_ their self-deception while convinced that we're doing no such thing — after all, they're already as deep as they could go.

Thus, the vast majority of evil looks nothing like it does in the movies. It mostly consists of people justifying selfish behaviors wrapped up in magnificent garb that makes them appear noble, even to themselves. Yet every act of evil, from the tiniest unkindness to the most bone-chilling atrocity, ultimately depends on the very same principle — and every time any one of us engages in it, we secretly reinforce that capacity in everyone else. Every time we skirt our conscience, we license others to do the same, which we can then judge them for. Over time, this self-deception accumulates into the form of the  great evils of our world. It does not matter who feel contempt _for_; simply feeling it empowers humanity's ultimate foe. There is but _one_ darkness, and it manifests itself through countless guises.

This is why we sometimes suspect the existence of an evil global conspiracy running the world from behind the scenes. The darkness in our minds is indeed conspiring, behaving like a singular _distributed malevolent entity_, manipulating all of humanity from beneath our conscious thresholds. The Christians know it as the Devil, and the Buddhists call it the ego. You can treat it as a metaphor, but it is also as real as anything you can touch. It is the _primordial_ evil conspiracy; the one to which all the rest owe their existence, and to which they ultimately filter up. It keeps our attention fixated perpetually outward, on the evil "out there," so that we will never look "in here," at the one place where we can actually defeat it. Every attempt to subdue it externally without being free of it internally only ends up creating more, usually in invisible ways.

How do we know if it is operating in us? The most sure sign is the presence of malice, contempt, or self-righteousness. If we harbor even the faintest sense that we are _intrinsically_ superior to our enemies; that they are _fundamentally_ defective, then we are unknowingly caught in its sway. We could say that kindness is any behavior that is free from this self-deception. It is only from this place that darkness can actually be fought. But entering this place is not all rainbows and sunshine.

---

There can be moments in life — such as during psychedelic trips, near-death experiences, or deep meditation or prayer — when you are confronted with the full depths of your own self-deception. You are shown every single instance where you skirted your conscience; every act of lying to yourself for your own personal gain. You are brought face-to-face with all the harm you've ever perpetrated since time immemorial, and it is far more than you could hope to clean up in a single lifetime. The pain is beyond what you can fathom; more than you think you can bear. How widely and quickly it spread! How many it affected! The darkness exploited your fear and pride, enabling you to do things you otherwise couldn't if only you had been seeing clearly.

But slowly, it dawns on you: the reason it hurts so much is that you never actually wanted to do any of this. It is only profound confusion that enabled it. Your whole being is then absorbed into that part of you that never wanted to hurt anyone; never _could_ want such a thing. And then it happens: the full mass of darkness is suddenly lifted from your mind. It feels exactly like you'd imagine being freed of a demonic possession. Beneath it is a Light so vast that it defies description; an infinite Love for all of reality that excludes nothing and forsakes no-one. You never truly departed from this Light; indeed, never could, because it turns out you _are_ the Light — and, astonishingly, so is everyone else.

You ultimately _are_ everyone and everything else, just pretending that you're not. One consciousness, peering out through countless eyes. There are many ways to say this, all of which sound absurd to the rational mind. But when you fully unveil the Light in yourself, you automatically see it in everyone else — including those who seemed not to have any. This is what the darkness is trying to hide. Everything we do to each other — or to Nature herself — we ultimately do to ourselves. How crazy to think otherwise! How foolish to judge others for not seeing it, when we weren't able to see it yet ourselves! Such a silly game we play, with such tragic consequences. We are continually shoving each other into the abyss to keep the game going, because we're not ready to wake up ourselves. Seeing this, we lose the desire to "get away" with anything. Why would we want to hide from the Light? How did we ever think we could? The sooner we see this, the better for everyone.

The strangest part is discovering how you simultaneously _knew_ this and yet somehow _didn't_. You convinced yourself that your unkind behavior was "for the greater good," even as you knew better. You could always perceive the inner Light in the "bad people," and you chose to smother it anyway — knowing that if you compartmentalized this knowledge carefully enough, nobody could blame you for it, because _you yourself_ would no longer know. Yet others could somehow sense what you were doing, and it gave them an excuse to pin the evils of the world on you. It is only now that you see how they were only lost in the same confusion that you were, that you are able to truly forgive them. You discover the surprising sense in which nobody actually _wants_ to harbor the darkness — or rather, how their apparent desire to harbor it is simply a reflection of our own desperate need to externalize our own. We should practically thank them for becoming the scapegoats that we needed.

You see for the first time _how_ others could sense what you were really doing, despite your astonishingly clever attempts to hide it. At the very deepest level, your mind is not truly separate from theirs, or from the world at large. It's not that others can read your mind, per se, but your deepest motivations inevitably weave themselves into the fabric of your "outer" reality; the two being fundamentally inseparable. The deepest choice of all is whether to stand firm in your Light or give in to the impostor. It is a choice you make in every moment, whether you know it or not — and the cumulative result determines your ultimate impact on the world. Others can sense your choices at a subconscious level, and these subtly influence their own. Our culture has convinced itself that this is mystical nonsense, despite it being right under our noses. We do this so that we can harbor our demons while pretending this has no consequences. The more we heal as a species, the more this worldview evaporates.

There is no way to force others to see any of this; force being a manifestation of the same fundamental mistake. Those who are most powerful at inducing this realization in others are simply those who hold it most strongly themselves. They are literally incapable of feeling malice, contempt, or self-righteousness, having thoroughly seen through them as horsemen of the darkness. Yet they are not weak. They are unafraid to fiercely confront the darkness in others. Being free of darkness themselves, they are immune to its charms. This enables their accusations to penetrate other minds, instead of being deflected by the defense mechanisms that the rest of us unwittingly trigger. Their attack therefore finds its mark — which is the darkness itself, and not the confused being who unwittingly harbors it — even if the being needs to be harmed in the process. This is all very difficult to describe, but part of you knows exactly what I mean. 

In the same way that your darkness can extend a secret handshake to theirs, your Light can do the same. It is nowhere near as violently pleasurable as provoking the darkness, but infinitely more valuable. This process can take a long time to unfold, and require many iterations — but it is the _only_ way that darkness is released from our world.

---

If we ultimately are the Light, how on Earth did we get to this place that looks nothing like it? This process is extremely tricky to convey, because it doesn't fit into our culture's standard metaphysics. You could say it all began with a subtle turn away from the Light. Then, fearing that we'd lost contact with our _absolute_ goodness, we went out seeking for it _relatively_ — that is, at the expense of apparent "others." We felt that we had to make them _bad_, and then violently defeat them, to earn our way back to our original goodness. But this just made things worse, and it quickly spiraled out of control. This is the apparent reality in which we now live.

The hardest thing to communicate about this story is that it does not unfold in what we normally conceive of as linear time. In a profound and surprising sense, every moment is the very first. Thus, every instant is an opportunity to rediscover our primordial Home, a place we never truly left. Each time we see this, we increasingly discover how our judgements of others are actually pointers back to an unhealed part of ourselves. As we heal ourselves, we discover how to heal our relationship with the "other," until it slowly dawns on us that there was never truly an "other." The more we see this, the more we vow to hold the Light for these seeming others, even when — indeed, _especially_ when — they cannot hold it for themselves. Far from being a burden, we discover that this has always been our true purpose; our deepest calling. Every encounter with evil becomes an opportunity to strengthen our commitment to the Light.

Looked at this way, kindness is anything that brings us all closer to remembering the truth, and evil is anything that pushes us away from it. Forsaking others is thus always a form of evil. It is a form of forsaking ourselves, because we are not ready to come Home yet. If this language feels too religious for you, feel free to find your own framing. In the end, there is only one truth anyway.

---

Unlike the Light, the darkness is not a real entity. It is an absence, not a presence. It is merely our willingness to turn away from our Light, instead listening to our agendas and justifications. As such, it can never be defeated by more absence. Yet make no mistake: although it is an absence, it still behaves like a sinister presence; a parasite of the mind. The darkness you see your enemies is the very _same_ entity in your mind that provokes you into seeing theirs as intrinsic. It manipulates your perception at such a fundamental level that you simply cannot fathom that you're being fooled. You're certain that you're seeing reality _as it is_. It is an _impossibly_ clever trick.

It is difficult to overstate just how much of our civilization is built on the shaky foundations of our aggregate self-deception. Every time any one of us skirts our conscience in any way, we contribute to the universal bank of darkness. Revenge fantasy films, YouTube videos of "Karens getting owned," vicious Facebook threads full of casual cruelty — each is a breeding ground for our collective demons. It all seeps into our physical reality, poisoning it. Everything from our unhealthy air, water, and soil, to our myriad societal ills and the climate crisis, is ultimately an external manifestation of a sickness within. As long as we perceive this sickness to exist only in others, we will never discover the hidden aspect of our own minds that secretly enables it, continually confusing our contempt for our authentic good. This is in no way suggesting that we are all equally complicit, by any stretch of the imagination. Nonetheless, we each have a profound role to play in leading the world back to the Light.

We've been led astray by a society that points us in precisely the wrong direction to accomplish this, although that is nobody's fault in particular. Our power does not lie in lording our superiority over others — including the "bad people" — but in discovering our surprising commonality with them. This is not some kumbaya sentiment, either. Again, genuine kindness has nothing to do with being nice. It can be fierce or even violent if necessary. It can take almost any form at all. Its only defining characteristic is that it is utterly free of self-deception. It does not misperceive evil as being intrinsic to any mind, and this seemingly-subtle change makes all the difference. The profound integrity of this act prevents the darkness in others from finding the "hook" in our own that it would normally use to justify itself, and is thereby weakened. Although we may still be enemies on the surface, our Light is becoming allied. We are beginning to remember how this whole game actually works.

To be clear: it does no good to pretend that you can see the Light in others when you can't. Doing so can backfire miserably. Thus, both pretending to see the Light and overlooking it are harmful. The only solution is to learn to actually see it, which happens naturally as you uncover your own. Similarly, it is astonishingly easy to lie to ourselves about whether our violent behavior is radical kindness or merely self-deception. This is how the darkness sneaks in. Perhaps the clearest measure of our own ability to deceive ourselves is how much contempt we are able to muster for our enemies; the "bad people." To the degree that this potential is present, we are susceptible to sliding down the dark path that has enabled every atrocity there ever was, without ever realizing that we've done so.

================================


We think that hating "bad people" is a sign of the good within us, but it's actually a sign of something much darker.

People are only able to cause harm due to a particular kind of self-deception. Part of them knows perfectly well that they are doing wrong, but this knowledge is carefully shielded from conscious self-reflection, so that it doesn't _feel_ wrong. All they consciously hear are their own clever justifications. It is a state of profound delusion; one that we rightly abhor — but the truth is that every one of us knows this state intimately well ourselves. We have all skirted our conscience before, pretending either that we couldn't hear it or that we didn't have to listen. Part of us knew exactly what we were doing, but we couldn't quite admit it to ourselves. Our examples may differ in degree, but not in kind.

When we encounter another person in this state, we somehow don't recognize a fellow human in the grip of a powerful self-deception that we ourselves are highly susceptible to; no, we see them as _fundamentally morally defective_ — as though the "badness" is somehow _intrinsic_ to their minds. But this is an illusion. What's actually happening is that the darkness in our own mind is luring us into seeing them this way, so that we will viciously attack them for it. This will drive the darkness deeper _into_ their minds while giving us plausible deniability. After all, we were only trying to _fight_ evil. If they became worse as a result, it can only be evidence that we were right about them after all: they are indeed _fundamentally_ defective, and must be stopped at any cost.

This is why we enjoy mocking, shaming, and contemptuously judging our enemies; the "bad people." Simply by pretending to be _fundamentally superior_ to them, we are telegraphing to them that we are under the sway of the very self-deception that we are viciously judging _them_ for. This makes them see us as evil for precisely the same reason we see _them_ that way — and not by accident. The darkness in our mind is extending a kind of "secret handshake" to theirs; a tacit agreement to keep this world bound in darkness while leaving us humans none the wiser. We may be enemies on the surface, but under the covers, our darkness is secretly allied — because the darker the world gets, the less we realize that we're harboring it, thus causing us to unwittingly intensify the process.

This is an _incredibly_ difficult thing to admit to oneself. Any time we feel even a trace of malice, contempt, or self-righteousness toward _anyone_ for _any reason_, our mind is secretly plotting a course to darken the world without our conscious knowledge — and it always finds a way to do so. But this knowledge isn't technically unconscious. It is completely accessible to our conscious mind, but we somehow choose not to notice it. This choice to engage in self-deception is _infectious_. It invites others to engage in their own unique forms of it. If you can only learn to see the part of you that already knows this, you will suddenly understand the secret mechanism behind _all the evil there ever was_ — and you will begin to recognize your own role in ending it. Humanity is badly lost, and it is only by finding our own way out of the abyss that we learn how to lead others out instead of secretly shoving them deeper in.

It is impossible to overstate the cleverness of this ruse. It is why we sometimes suspect the existence of an evil global conspiracy running the world from behind the scenes. The darkness in our minds is indeed conspiring, behaving more like a singular _distributed malevolent entity_, manipulating all of humanity from beneath our conscious thresholds. The Christians know it as the Devil, and the Buddhists call it the ego. You can treat it as a metaphor, but it is also as real as anything you can touch. It is the _primordial_ evil conspiracy; the one to which all the rest owe their existence, and to which they ultimately filter up. It keeps our attention fixated perpetually outward, on the evil "out there," so that we never notice its insidious presence "in here"; the one place where we can actually defeat it. Every attempt to subdue it externally without being free of it internally only ends up creating more, in ways that are normally invisible to our conscious minds — but that we _can_ learn to see.

It is surely true that "the elites" are playing us common people against each other to take our attention off of them, but the Devil is playing a _much_ bigger game; one in which even the elites are merely pawns. It _wants_ us to hate them, to take our attention off of _it_. But if hating them isn't the right approach, then what is? To understand this, we must first go deeper.

It all seeps into our physical reality, poisoning it. Everything from our unhealthy air, water, and soil, to our myriad societal ills and the climate crisis, is ultimately an external manifestation of a sickness within. As long as we perceive this sickness to exist only in others, we will never discover the hidden aspect of our own minds that secretly enables it, continually confusing our contempt for our authentic good. This is in no way suggesting that we are all equally complicit, by any stretch of the imagination. Nonetheless, we each have a profound role to play in leading the world back to the Light.

We've been led astray by a society that points us in precisely the wrong direction to accomplish this, although that is nobody's fault in particular. Our power does not lie in lording our superiority over others — including the "bad people" — but in discovering our surprising commonality with them. This is not some kumbaya sentiment, either. Again, genuine kindness has nothing to do with being nice. It can be fierce or even violent if necessary. It can take almost any form at all. Its only defining characteristic is that it is utterly free of self-deception. It does not misperceive evil as being intrinsic to any mind, and this seemingly-subtle change makes all the difference. The profound integrity of this act prevents the darkness in others from finding the "hook" in our own that it would normally use to justify itself, and is thereby weakened. Although we may still be enemies on the surface, our Light is becoming allied. We are beginning to remember how this whole game actually works.

To be clear: it does no good to pretend that you can see the Light in others when you can't. Doing so can backfire miserably. Thus, both pretending to see the Light and overlooking it are harmful. The only solution is to learn to actually see it, which happens naturally as you uncover your own. Similarly, it is astonishingly easy to lie to ourselves about whether our violent behavior is radical kindness or merely self-deception. This is how the darkness sneaks in. Perhaps the clearest measure of our own ability to deceive ourselves is how much contempt we are able to muster for our enemies; the "bad people." To the degree that this potential is present, we are susceptible to sliding down the dark path that has enabled every atrocity there ever was, without ever realizing that we've done so. All that is required is the right — or wrong — confluence of circumstances. This happens faster than you can imagine, and you _do not_ want to find yourself there. You _will_ have to confront it, sooner or later.

---

Everything you do makes a difference, in ways that you can hardly fathom. There are vast and subtle networks of causality that we are normally unconscious of, and that secretly drive the fate of the world. If we pay attention only to the surface activity, we miss out on the bulk of what actually shapes our reality. Evil can look sweet and pretty, while kindness may look nothing like our naive interpretations of it. It is impossible to know which is which — and easy to convince ourselves otherwise — until we have done the deep inner work that eradicates the core confusion. We each catch glimpses from time to time, and it is our duty to carry those glimpses into the world as best we are able. I wish I could tell you that I have completed the journey myself, but alas, I am a mere fledgling. I am still liable to mess things up royally, and I hope you will hold my feet to the fire when I do. I promise to do the same for you.

May all beings be free from suffering and its causes. Amen.

================================


Reflecting on the dysfunctional state of the world, it's hard not to suspect that there's some sort of evil conspiracy lurking behind it all. In a sense, there actually is, but it is *infinitely more strange* than we can fathom. The only way to end it is to recognize its existence within our very own minds. Only by freeing ourselves from its insidious grip do we gain the capacity to free others.

---

Have you ever done something that you believed was right at the time, only to realize much later that it was actually wrong — even according to your own deepest standards? It is a bizarre sort of experience. You are confronted with the fact that on some level, you knew it was wrong even as you did it — yet you managed to hide this knowledge from yourself, so that in another sense, you really *didn't* know. Every one of us engages in such "conscience skirting," whether we realize it or not. Indeed, it is those of us who are least aware of it who are most engaged in it.

What is it that allows us to hide knowledge of our wrongdoing from our own conscious minds? This state is a paradoxical one: we simultaneously *know* and yet somehow *do not.* It is this phenomenon that is responsible for *all the evil there ever was,* from the tiniest act of unkindness to the most horrific atrocity ever committed. Our examples may differ in degree, but not in kind — and every time any one of us engages in it, we lower the threshold for others to do the same.

We never notice when we ourselves are in it, but we're highly sensitive to its presence in others. It makes us perceive them as *bad people*, who we then feel compelled to treat accordingly. We believe that by treating the "bad people" with contempt — that is, as though they are *fundamentally defective* — we will somehow benefit the world. But if you look carefully enough into your mind while feeling this way — and this is hard — you'll discover something much more insidious at work.

Contempt is a fundamentally malicious attitude, and simply by harboring it, you are telegraphing to your target that you're in the grip of self-deception yourself. You may feel like you're "fighting evil," but deep down, you know that you're only liable to make them dig in their heels — which you can then use as evidence that you were right about them, thus compelling you to escalate. Something in us *wants* to be forced to unleash the full extent of our righteous wrath — perhaps the most delicious feeling of all.

Although you may not realize that you're doing this — at least, consciously — your enemy subconsciously does, which is *why* they dig in their heels. They are perceiving in you the very error that you are viciously judging them for, which makes them perceive *you* as "evil" for precisely the same reason you see *them* that way. Any compunction they might have felt about their own wrongdoing goes out the window — which is precisely the result you secretly wanted.

What happened is that the darkness in your own mind recognized itself in your enemy, who it then lured into this trap. It is like a *secret handshake* between your darkness and theirs. The world is darkened as a result, but we don't notice this — or if we do, we blame it on them. After all, any *decent* person would have repented, or at least introspected, in the face of such overwhelming good. We have created *new evil* in the world, but we tell ourselves that we're simply uncovering the evil already there. After all, they are *fundamentally* defective, and so nothing *we* did could have made any difference.

This is just one of an infinite number of ways the darkness tricks us into doing its bidding while flawlessly convinced that we are helping. The truth is that *any* time we skirt our conscience — which is *far more often* than we realize — we are secretly inviting others to do the same, who we can then blame for the sorry state of the world, thereby licensing ourselves to engage in *more* self-serving behavior that we will never recognize as such.

This is how the darkness keeps itself alive; cleverly hiding itself from our own minds while powerfully sensitizing us to its presence in others. We don't recognize that they are in the grip of a delusion that we ourselves are highly susceptible to; no, we see *their* evil as intrinsic, compelling us to viciously attack it. We never realize that this feeling of *moral superiority* is itself the surest sign that we are under its dark sway. A mind that is free of self-deception simply cannot feel malice, contempt, or even self-righteousness toward *anybody* for any reason.

This is the opposite of what society teaches us: that to be "good people," we must show our contempt for the "bad people." In a way, this isn't entirely wrong: contempt for *beliefs* and *behaviors* can indeed come from a good place. But it almost always degenerates into contempt for the people themselves. All goodwill drains from our hearts, and we embrace the darkness, convincing ourselves that in this case, it isn't really darkness at all. In fact, we can *prove* it.

This could all be avoided if we learned to listen to our hearts instead of focusing exclusively on our minds. Our thoughts can be freely manipulated by the darkness, which is why it is so easy to justify evil behavior. Our thoughts are the perfect vector for the darkness to sneak in, without us ever suspecting it. If you *really* want to know whether you're acting from your inner Light or from your darkness, you cannot blindly trust your mind. You must learn to see deeper.

The vast majority of dark behavior feels nothing at all like evil. It simply feels like "business as usual." We find all kinds of ways to justify subtly self-serving behavior, covering it up with clever cover stories about all the good it will do. These justifications have a certain "signature" to them that you can learn to perceive, both in yourself and in others. When you recognize it, stay far away. You can be *certain* that no good will come of it, no matter how cleverly anyone proves otherwise. Disregard this at your own peril — and at everyone else's, too.

The darkness dims our perception of the *life* in others — be they people, animals, or nature at large — so that we cannot feel the deep sense of wrongness that comes from dominating, exploiting, or mistreating them. It's not that we *can't* feel it; it's that the darkness *blinds* us to it. It is this phenomenon that enables genocides, our ravaging of the planet — and, perhaps most surprisingly, our hatred for the people who engage in these atrocities.

It is impossible to overstate just how insidious the darkness is. It behaves like a _singular distributed malevolent entity_, manipulating all of humanity from beneath our conscious thresholds. The Christians know it as the Devil, and the Buddhists call it the ego. You can treat it as a metaphor, but it is as real as anything you can touch. It is the _primordial_ evil conspiracy; the one to which all the rest owe their existence, and to which they ultimately filter up. 

We are learning to recognize that "the elites" are playing us against each other, to take our attention off of them — but the Darkness is playing a _much bigger game_; one in which even the elites are merely pawns. It _needs_ us to hate them, to keep the whole cycle alive. By keeping our attention fixated perpetually outward, on the evil "out there," we never notice its insidious presence "in here"; the one place where we can actually defeat it.

It is only once you've seen how thoroughly the Darkness has ensnared your own mind that you begin to appreciate what is taking place in the minds of the "bad people" — and exactly how to free them of it. Without seeing this, it is *only* possible to drive them deeper into its sinister clutches, while feeling flawlessly convinced that you are "helping." So how do we see it?

---

There can be moments in life — such as during psychedelic trips, near-death experiences, or deep meditation or prayer — when you are confronted with the full depths of your own self-deception. You are shown every single instance where you skirted your conscience; every act of lying to yourself for your own personal gain. You are brought face-to-face with all the harm you've ever perpetrated since time immemorial, and it is more than you could ever hope to clean up in a single lifetime. The pain is beyond what you can fathom; more than you can bear. How widely and quickly it spread! How many it affected! The darkness exploited your fear and pride, enabling you to do things you otherwise couldn't if only you had been seeing clearly.

But slowly, it dawns on you: the reason it hurts so much is that you never actually wanted to do any of this. It is only profound confusion that enabled it. Your whole being is then absorbed into that part of you that never wanted to hurt anyone; never _could_ want such a thing. Then, suddenly, the full mass of darkness is lifted from your mind. It feels exactly like being freed of a demonic possession. Beneath it is a Light so vast that it defies description; an infinite Love for all of reality that excludes nothing and forsakes no-one. You never truly departed from this Light; indeed, never could, because it turns out you _are_ the Light! But the big reveal is that, astonishingly, *so is everyone else*.

In fact, you ultimately _are_ everyone and everything else, just pretending that you're not. One consciousness, peering out through countless eyes. There are many ways to say this, all of which sound absurd to the rational mind. But when you fully unveil the Light in yourself, you automatically see it in everyone else — including those who convincingly seemed not to have any. This is what the darkness is trying to hide. Everything we do to each other — or to Nature herself — we ultimately do to ourselves. How crazy to think otherwise! How foolish to judge others for not seeing it, when we weren't able to see it yet ourselves! Such a silly game we play, with such tragic consequences. We are continually shoving each other into the abyss to prevent others from waking up, because we're not ready to wake up ourselves. Seeing this, we lose all desire to "get away" with any form of misbehavior. Why would we want to hide from the Light? How did we ever think we could? The sooner we see give this up, the better for everyone.

The strangest part is discovering how you simultaneously _knew_ this and yet somehow _didn't_. You convinced yourself that your unkind behavior was "for the greater good," even as you knew better. You could always perceive the inner Light in the "bad people," and you chose to smother it anyway — knowing that if you compartmentalized this knowledge carefully enough, nobody could blame you for it, because _you yourself_ would no longer know. Yet others could somehow sense what you were doing, and it gave them an excuse to pin the darkness on you. It is only now that you see how they were only lost in the same confusion that you were, that you are able to truly forgive them. You discover the surprising sense in which nobody actually _wants_ to harbor the darkness — or rather, how their apparent desire to harbor it is simply the Universe balancing out our own desperate need to externalize our own; almost like a conservation law. We should practically thank them for becoming the scapegoats that we needed.

You see for the first time _how_ others could sense what you were really doing, despite your astonishingly clever attempts to hide it. At the very deepest level, your mind is not truly separate from theirs, or from the world at large. It's not that others can read your mind, per se, but your deepest motivations inevitably weave themselves into the fabric of your "outer" reality; the two being fundamentally inseparable. The deepest choice of all is whether to stand firm in your Light or give in to the impostor. It is a choice you make in every moment, whether you know it or not — and the cumulative result determines your ultimate impact on the world. Others can sense your choices at a subconscious level, and these subtly influence their own. Our culture has convinced itself that this is mystical nonsense, despite it being right under our noses. We do this so that we can harbor our demons while pretending this has no consequences. The more we heal as a species, the more this worldview evaporates.

There is no way to force others to see any of this; force being a manifestation of the same fundamental mistake. Those who are most powerful at inducing this realization in others are simply those who hold it most strongly themselves. They are literally incapable of feeling malice, contempt, or self-righteousness, having thoroughly seen through them as horsemen of the darkness. Yet they are not weak. They are unafraid to fiercely confront the darkness in others. Being free of darkness themselves, they are immune to its sinister charms. This enables their accusations to penetrate other minds, instead of being deflected by the defense mechanisms that the rest of us unwittingly trigger. Their attack therefore finds its mark — which is the darkness itself, and not the confused being who unwittingly harbors it — even if the being needs to be harmed in the process. This is all very difficult to describe, but part of you knows exactly what I mean.

In the same way that your darkness can extend a secret handshake to theirs, your Light can do the same. It is nowhere near as violently pleasurable as attacking the darkness, but infinitely more valuable. This process can take a long time to unfold, and require many iterations — but it is the _only_ way that darkness is released from our world.

---

If we ultimately are the Light, how on Earth did we get to this place that looks nothing like it? This process is extremely tricky to convey, because it doesn't fit into our culture's standard metaphysics. You could say it all began with a subtle turn away from the Light. Then, fearing that we'd lost contact with our _absolute_ goodness, we went out seeking for it _relatively_ — that is, at the expense of apparent "others." We felt that we had to make them _bad_, and then violently defeat them, to earn our way back to our original goodness. But this just made things worse, and it quickly spiraled out of control. This is the apparent reality in which we now live.

The hardest thing to communicate about this story is that it does not unfold in what we normally conceive of as linear time. In a profound and surprising sense, every moment is the very first. Thus, every instant is an opportunity to rediscover our primordial Home, a place we never truly left. Each time we see this, we increasingly discover how our judgements of others are actually pointers back to an unhealed part of ourselves. As we heal ourselves, we discover how to heal our relationship with the "other," until it slowly dawns on us that there was never truly an "other." The more we see this, the more we vow to hold the Light for these seeming others, even when — indeed, _especially_ when — they cannot hold it for themselves. Far from being a burden, we discover that this has always been our true purpose; our deepest calling. Every encounter with evil becomes an opportunity to strengthen our commitment to the Light.

Looked at this way, kindness is anything that brings us all closer to remembering the truth, and evil is anything that pushes us away from it. Forsaking others is thus always a form of evil. It is a form of forsaking ourselves, because we are not ready to come Home yet. If this language feels too religious for you, feel free to find your own framing. In the end, there is only one truth anyway.

---

Unlike the Light, the darkness is not a real entity. It is a profound absence masquerading as a presence. It is ultimately only our willingness to turn away from our Light, instead listening to our agendas and justifications. As such, it can never be defeated by more absence. Yet make no mistake: although it is an absence, it still behaves like a sinister presence; a parasite of the mind. The darkness you see your enemies is the very _same_ entity that exists in your own mind, and that provokes you into seeing theirs as intrinsic. It manipulates your perception at such a fundamental level that you simply cannot fathom that you're being fooled. You're certain that you're seeing reality _as it is_. It is an _impossibly_ clever trick.

It is difficult to overstate just how much of our civilization is built on the shaky foundations of our aggregate self-deception. Every time any one of us skirts our conscience in any way, we contribute to the universal bank of darkness. Revenge fantasy films, YouTube videos of "Karens getting owned," vicious Facebook threads full of casual cruelty — each is a breeding ground for our collective demons.

> _Be kind, for everyone you meet is fighting a great battle._ —Author unknown

What is kindness? It is the only thing that actually fights evil. Everything else just makes it worse.

---

The deepest part of you can perceive yourself in literally everyone and everything, strange as that may sound; yet you hide this knowledge from your conscious mind, so that you don't have to feel their suffering. It is this same mechanism that enables the "bad people" to do what *they* do: their minds are shielding them from fully perceiving the *life* in their victims — be they other people, animals, or nature at large. This is the secret principle behind *all the evil there ever was.*

Any time any one of us employs this shielding, we lower the threshold for everyone else to do the same — no matter how noble our intent. For example, when we witness evil, we often feel compelled not only to *stop* the evildoer, but to *harm* them — quite independently of any good it will bring. This is difficult to admit. We tell ourselves that we're acting for "the greater good," but part of us simply enjoys seeing the "bad people" suffer.

Which of these is our true intention — the good or the harm? Does it even matter? So long as our cruelty produces *some* benefit — which it actually might — who cares if we also get to feel a bit of glee from watching them suffer? After all, it is a private pleasure that has no bearing on the outcome. But this is a dark lie.

<p align="center" width="100%">
    <img width="300px" src="img/half-evil.png"> 
</p>

Not only can our target sense the malicious intent, but we secretly *want* them to. We are baiting them into behavior that will force us to escalate, but in a way that will keep our hands apparently clean. Something in us wants to be forced to unleash the full extent of our righteous wrath —because **nothing** feels better than violently punishing evil.

Part of us knows this will only drive the darkness deeper into their minds, thereby darkening the world as a whole; and that any benefit that may accrue will be temporary and superficial at best — yet we conceal this knowledge, writing it off as unfortunate collateral damage. But it isn't "collateral" at all: it is secretly the *whole point.*

> _And no wonder, for even Satan masquerades as an angel of light. So it is not strange that his ministers also masquerade as ministers of righteousness._ —2 Corinthians 11:14-16

Evil is a kind of mind-virus. We recognize it easily in others but never in ourselves. It compels us to viciously attack them, never realizing that this only conveys that we're under the sway of the very delusion we're violently judging *them* for, thus compelling them to return the favor. It is like a secret handshake between our darkness and theirs — which it turns out aren't separate at all.

<p align="center" width="100%">

All of our Darkness behaves more like a _singular distributed malevolent entity_, manipulating all of humanity from beneath our conscious thresholds. The Christians know it as the Devil, and the Buddhists call it the ego. You can treat it as a metaphor, but it is as real as anything you can touch. It is why we sometimes suspect the existence of an evil global conspiracy. It is the _primordial_ evil conspiracy; the one to which all the rest owe their existence and to which they ultimately filter up.

This entity drives us relentlessly toward Armageddon — situations where everyone is violently proving how _righteous_ they are. It is why the US may be headed toward civil war, and explains bitter [divorces](https://www.gottman.com/blog/this-one-thing-is-the-biggest-predictor-of-divorce/)  where each side feels like the exclusive victim / hero. Nearly the whole world is caught in its terrible sway, evil provoking evil at every turn, without anyone recognizing its true origin deep within our psyches.

Every act of unkindness we've ever perpetrated on anyone; all the hardness we carry in our hearts; has only ever been in service of humanity's ultimate nemesis.

To be clear: there really *are* people who knowingly serve the Darkness, and who conspire to cause great harm. They must be stopped, and this isn't always "nice." But to the extent that we perceive them as *fundamentally* defective, or ourselves as *intrinsically superior* — in short, with contempt — we are falling into the ultimate trap. Contempt for *beliefs* or *behaviors* isn't necessarily harmful, but contempt for people always is. It exists only to help us hide our own darkness from ourselves by reinforcing it in others — allies, enemies, and bystanders alike.

The vast majority of dark behavior feels **absolutely nothing like evil**. It simply feels like "business as usual." We find all kinds of ways to justify self-serving behavior, using the sorry state of the world as an excuse. Corporations cheat us, so who cares if we skim from them? Our political opponents are morally defective, so why shouldn't we mock and shame them? There are infinitely more examples, most of which are too subtle to capture in words.

It is not that skimming or shaming are inherently wrong. But we disregard that quiet voice warning us that we are lying to ourselves. The more we lie, the more we lose the ability to detect that it *is* a lie. The "little voice" gets increasingly drowned out by clever justifications, which we fail to recognize as such — because why would our own minds lie to us? This is the trap in which modern humans are caught. We have abandoned our inner knowing for clever judgments. After all, if something cannot be objectively proven, then it might as well not exist.

<p align="center" width="100%">
    <img width="300px" src="img/angel-devil-shoulders.png"> 
</p>

Every time any one of us makes this mistake — which happens *far more often* than we realize — we are strengthening the same capacity in everyone else. The dark lies that politicians use to foment wars are made of the very same "stuff" as the lies we tell ourselves. Again, it's not just the same *kind* of stuff. Each act of self-deception gets woven into the very fabric of our reality, accumulating in the body politic, reconfiguring itself, eventually erupting in the form of atrocities that we feel *absolutely no connection* to — and which then serve as justification for *more*.

Without recognizing our own role in all this, it is impossible to do actual good in the world. Instead, we will continually buy into whichever narratives sound best — never recognizing that no matter how "good" they are, we are secretly just feeding the Beast. If we really want to know whether a cause is "good" or not, we cannot simply evaluate its *contents*. We must be able to feel into its *origin.* **So much suffering** could be avoided if we only learned to recognize this.

The entire fight against evil comes down to recognizing this "deeper knowing." For it is only by seeing how cleverly the darkness has manipulated our own minds that we begin to recognize just how deeply the "bad people" are stuck — and exactly what we can do about it.

Yet they somehow always knew.

You now see _how_ they knew despite your astonishingly clever attempts to hide it. At the very deepest level, your mind is not separate from theirs. It's not that others can read your mind, per se, but your inner motivations inevitably leak into your outer reality; the two being fundamentally inseparable. Everything you do "in here" has an impact "out there," whether you see it or not.

The deepest motivation of all is to be of service to the Whole and not just to a part. This is a choice you make in every moment, whether you know it or not. Others can sense this choice at a subconscious level, and it influences their own. Your unwillingness to forsake them under any circumstances slowly reminds their darkness of the *one thing* it can never truly hide from. This is the *only* way that evil evaporates from our world. If you been freed from your own, it is only due to the grace of countless "others," whom you now honor by paying it forward.

There is no way to force others to see any of this; force being a manifestation of the same fundamental mistake. Those who are most powerful at inducing this realization in others are simply those who hold it most strongly themselves. They are literally incapable of feeling malice, contempt, or self-righteousness toward *anybody* for *any reason*, having thoroughly recognized them as weapons of the Darkness. Yet such people are not weak. They are unafraid to fiercely confront the darkness in others. 

This is true kindness, and it has nothing to do with being nice. It need not take any form in particular. Its only defining characteristic is that it is utterly free of self-deception. It surgically targets the parasite itself, instead of the confused being who unwittingly harbors it. The profound integrity of this act prevents their parasite from finding the excuse it would otherwise use to reinforce itself, and is weakened as a result. The more entrenched a person's darkness, the more fierce the kindness required to uproot it. It may be tough love, but it is always Love.

In the same way that your darkness can extend a secret handshake to others, your Light can do the same. It is nowhere near as violently pleasurable as subjugating them, but infinitely more valuable.

If we ultimately are the Light, how on Earth did we get to this place that looks nothing like it? This process is extremely tricky to convey, because it doesn't fit into our culture's standard metaphysics. We began as undifferentiated Light, but then made the mistake of subtly turning away from it. Then, fearing that we'd lost contact with our _absolute_ goodness, we went out seeking for it _relatively_ — that is, at the expense of "others." This simultaneously *created* those "others," who we then felt compelled to violently defeat, in order to prove our own goodness and thereby return Home. But this just made things worse, and the whole thing quickly spiraled out of control. This is the apparent reality in which we now live.

The hardest thing to communicate about this story is that it does not unfold in what we normally conceive of as linear time. In a profound and surprising sense, every moment is the very first. Thus, every instant is an opportunity to rediscover our primordial Home, a place we never truly left. Each time we see this, we increasingly discover how our judgements of others are actually pointers back to an unhealed part of ourselves. As we heal ourselves, we discover how to heal our relationship with the "other," until it slowly dawns on us that there was never truly an "other."

The more we see this, the more we vow to hold the Light for these seeming others, even when — indeed, _especially_ when — they cannot hold it for themselves. Far from being a burden, we discover that this has always been our true purpose; our deepest calling. Every encounter with evil becomes an opportunity to strengthen our commitment to the Light.

Looked at this way, kindness is anything that brings us all closer to remembering the truth, and evil is anything that pushes us away from it. Forsaking others is thus always a form of evil. It is a form of forsaking ourselves, because we are not ready to come Home yet. If this language feels too religious for you, feel free to find your own framing. In the end, there is only one Truth.

> *Darkness cannot drive out darkness, only light can do that. Hate cannot drive out hate, only love can do that.* ― Martin Luther King, Jr.

Unlike the Light, the darkness is not a real entity. It is a profound absence masquerading as a presence. This is why it cannot be defeated by more absence. Yet make no mistake: it still behaves like a sinister presence. It manipulates our perception at such a fundamental level that we simply cannot fathom that we're being fooled. We're certain that we're seeing reality _as it is_. It is an _impossibly_ clever trick, but one we can learn to see through.

Revenge fantasy films, YouTube videos of "Karens getting owned," Facebook threads full of casual cruelty and jokes about "Darwin awards" — each is a breeding ground for our collective Demon. It all seeps into our physical reality, slowly poisoning it. Everything from our unhealthy air, water, and soil, to our myriad societal ills and the climate crisis itself, is ultimately an external manifestation of a sickness within. As long as we perceive it to exist only in others, we will never discover its hidden aspect in ourselves. This is in no way suggesting that we are all equally complicit. Yet we each have a unique role to play in leading us all back to the Light.

To be clear: it does no good to pretend that we can see the Light in others when we can't. Doing so can backfire miserably. Thus, both pretending to see the Light in others and overlooking it can be harmful. The only solution is to learn to *actually* see it, which happens as a natural consequence of unveiling our own. Similarly, it is astonishingly easy to lie to ourselves about whether our violent behavior is "radical kindness" or merely self-deception. This is a common way for the darkness to sneak in.

Perhaps the clearest measure of our ability to deceive ourselves is how much contempt we still feel for our enemies. To the degree that this potential is still present, we are susceptible to sliding down the dark path that has enabled every genocide, without ever realizing that we are. All that is required is the right — or wrong — confluence of circumstances. To believe yourself immune is the greatest of follies, and the surest indication that you are *not.*

---

There are vast and subtle networks of causality that we normally hide from ourselves, and that secretly drive the fate of the world. Everything we do makes a difference, in ways that we can hardly fathom. If we pay attention only to the surface activity, we miss out on the bulk of what actually shapes our reality. Evil can look sweet and pretty, while kindness sometimes looks nothing of the sort. It is impossible to know which is which — and easy to convince ourselves otherwise — until we have done the deep inner work that eradicates the core confusion. 

We each catch glimpses of the Light from time to time, and it is our duty to carry them into the world as best we are able. I wish I could tell you that I have completed the journey myself, but alas, I am a mere fledgling. I am still liable to mess things up royally, and I only ask that you hold my feet to the fire when I do. I promise to do the same for you.

May all beings be free from suffering and its causes. Amen.

> _Be kind, for everyone you meet is fighting a great battle._ —Author unknown

What is kindness? It is the only thing that actually fights evil. Everything else just makes it worse.

---

The deepest part of you can perceive yourself in literally everyone and everything, strange as that may sound; yet you hide this knowledge from your conscious mind, so that you don't have to feel their suffering. It is this same mechanism that enables the "bad people" to do what *they* do: their minds are shielding them from fully perceiving the *life* in their victims — be they other people, animals, or nature at large. This is the secret principle behind *all the evil there ever was.*

Any time any one of us employs this shielding, we lower the threshold for everyone else to do the same — no matter how noble our intent. For example, when we witness evil, we often feel compelled to not only *stop* the evildoer, but to *harm* them — quite independently of any good it will do. This is hard to admit. We tell ourselves that it is "for the greater good," but part of us simply enjoys seeing the "bad people" suffer.

Is this wrong? So long as our behavior produces some good — which it actually might, at least in the short term – why does it matter how we feel about it? All that should matter is the outcome. *So what* if we get to feel a bit of glee from watching "bad people" suffer? It is a private pleasure that has no bearing on the result.

But this is a dark lie.

Not only can our target sense our malicious intent, but we secretly *want* them to. It telegraphs that we're under the sway of the very sickness we're viciously judging *them* for, thus baiting them into behavior we can use as justification to escalate. Something in us *wants* to be forced to unleash the full extent of our righteous wrath — and it will stop at nothing to ensure this outcome.

This is the *only* purpose of contempt (for other people). It is a fundamentally malicious attitude secretly meant to drive the darkness deeper *into* people's minds, where we can violently judge them for it, while giving ourselves plausible deniability: we are only *fighting evil,* after all — and how could that ever be wrong?

It is worth pausing to reflect on the cleverness of this ruse. Simply *entertaining* the darkness in your own mind is sufficient to spread it, despite there being no external evidence of it. The deepest part of us *knows* when we've done this, but we carefully hide this knowledge from our conscious minds, thereby disowning it. Yet that darkness continues to live on in the world, orphaned; giving rise to countless knock-on effects that we never recognize our own connection to.

It is not until we appreciate the terrifying genius of this mechanism that we begin to recognize exactly what is going on in the minds of the "bad people," and how we can be of service in ending it. It's not that they *don't know* that they're doing wrong, but something is preventing them from fully confronting it — and this "something" is profoundly intertwined with our own decisions, much as we hate to admit it. In fact, it is this *refusal to admit it* that allows it to thrive.

> _And no wonder, for even Satan masquerades as an angel of light. So it is not strange that his ministers also masquerade as ministers of righteousness._ —2 Corinthians 11:14-16

Evil is a kind of mind-virus. We recognize it easily in others but never in ourselves. It tricks us into perceiving them as *fundamentally defective* and thus completely unlike us; never realizing that this very attitude is the surest sign that we are under its dark command. By acceding to this misperception, we are silently affirming that *darkness is the way.* It is like a secret handshake between our darkness and theirs — which it turns out aren't separate at all.

<p align="center" width="100%">
    <img width="300px" src="img/parasite.png"> 
</p>
The Darkness behaves more like a _singular distributed malevolent entity_, manipulating all of humanity from beneath our conscious thresholds. The Christians know it as the Devil, and the Buddhists call it the ego. You can treat it as a metaphor, but it is as real as anything you can touch. It is why we sometimes suspect the existence of an evil global conspiracy. It is the _primordial_ evil conspiracy; the one to which all the rest owe their existence and to which they ultimately filter up.

This entity drives us relentlessly toward Armageddon — situations in which everyone is violently proving how _righteous_ they are. It is why the US may be headed toward civil war, and explains bitter [divorces](https://www.gottman.com/blog/this-one-thing-is-the-biggest-predictor-of-divorce/)  where each side feels like the exclusive victim / hero. Nearly the whole world is caught in its terrible sway, evil provoking evil at every turn, without anyone recognizing its true origin deep within our psyches.

Every act of unkindness we've ever perpetrated on anyone; all the hardness we carry in our hearts; has only ever been in service of humanity's ultimate nemesis.

<p align="center" width="100%">
    <img width="300px" src="img/evil-above-world.png"> 
</p>

---

To be clear: there really *are* people who knowingly serve the Darkness, and who conspire to cause great harm. They must be stopped, and this isn't always "nice." But to the extent that we perceive them as *fundamentally* defective, or ourselves as *intrinsically superior* — in short, with contempt — we are falling into the ultimate trap. Contempt for *beliefs* or *behaviors* isn't necessarily harmful, but contempt for people always is. It exists only to help us hide our own darkness from ourselves by reinforcing it in others — allies, enemies, and bystanders alike.

The vast majority of dark behavior feels **absolutely nothing like evil**. It simply feels like "business as usual." We find all kinds of ways to justify self-serving behavior, using the sorry state of the world as an excuse. Corporations cheat us, so what's wrong with skimming from them? Our political opponents are morally defective, so why shouldn't we mock and shame them? An infinite variety of examples abounds, most of which are too subtle to capture in words.

It is not that skimming or shaming are inherently wrong, but we disregard that quiet voice warning us that we are lying to ourselves. The more we lie, the more we lose the ability to even detect that it *is* a lie. The "little voice" gets increasingly drowned out by clever justifications, which we fail to recognize as such — because why would our own minds lie to us? 

This is the trap in which modern humanity is caught. We have abandoned our inner knowing for clever judgments, writing off such knowing as religious myth.

<p align="center" width="100%">
    <img width="300px" src="img/angel-devil-shoulders.png"> 
</p>

Every time any one of us makes this mistake — which happens *far more often* than we realize — we are strengthening the same capacity in everyone else. The dark lies that politicians use to foment wars are made of the very same "stuff" as the lies we tell ourselves. Again, it's not just the same *kind* of stuff. Every act of self-deception gets woven into the very fabric of our reality, accumulating in the body politic, reconfiguring itself, eventually erupting in the form of atrocities that we feel *absolutely no connection* to — and which then serve as justification for *more*.

Without recognizing our own role in all this, it is impossible to do actual good in the world. Instead, we will continually buy into whichever narratives sound best — never recognizing that no matter how "good" they are, we are secretly just feeding the Beast. If we really want to know whether a cause is "good" or not, we cannot simply evaluate its *contents*. We must be able to feel into its *origin.* **So much suffering** could be avoided if we only learned to recognize this.

Thus, the entire fight against evil comes down to recognizing this "deeper knowing." For it is only by seeing how cleverly the darkness has manipulated our own minds that we discover the true meaning of *kindness* — and to appreciate its unique power to defeat our common nemesis.

> _For so long as the root of wickedness is hidden, it is strong. But when it is recognized, it is dissolved. When it is revealed, it perishes. ... It is powerful because we have not recognized it._ — The Gospel of Philip

There can be moments in life — such as during psychedelic trips, near-death experiences, or deep meditation or prayer — when you are confronted with the full depths of your own self-deception. You are shown every single instance where you skirted your conscience; every act of lying to yourself for your own personal gain. You are brought face-to-face with all the harm you've ever perpetrated from time immemorial, and it is more than you could hope to clean up in a single lifetime. The pain is beyond what you can fathom; more than you can bear. How widely and quickly it spread! How many it affected! The darkness exploited your fear and pride, enabling you to do things you couldn't have if only you had been totally honest.

The guilt is overwhelming. But then it dawns on you: the only reason it hurts so much is that you never actually wanted to do this. It is only profound confusion that enabled it. Your whole being is absorbed into that part of you that never wanted to hurt anyone; never _could_ want such a thing. Then, suddenly, the full mass of darkness lifts from your mind. It feels like being freed of a demonic possession. Beneath it is a Light so vast that it defies description; an infinite Love for all of reality that excludes nothing and forsakes no-one. This Light is what you ultimately are — *wonder of wonders* — and surprisingly, *so is everyone else*.

In fact, you ultimately _are_ everyone and everything else, just pretending that you're not. One consciousness, peering out through countless eyes. There are many ways to say this, all of which sound absurd to the rational mind. But when you fully unveil the Light in yourself, you automatically see it in everyone else — including those who convincingly seem not to have any. This is what the darkness is trying to hide.

Everything we do to each other — or to Nature herself — we ultimately do to ourselves. It is impossible to benefit ourselves at the world's expense, because we *are* the world. How crazy to think otherwise! How foolish to judge others for not seeing it, when we couldn't see it yet ourselves! In fact, this is the only way we *could* judge them. 

We are continually shoving each other into the abyss to prevent others from waking up, because we're not ready to wake up ourselves. Seeing this, we lose all desire to "get away" with anything. Why would we want to? How did we ever think we could?
<p align="center" width="100%">

The strangest part is discovering how you simultaneously _knew_ all this and yet somehow _didn't_. You convinced yourself that your unkind behavior was "for the greater good," even as you knew better. You could always perceive the Light in the "bad people," but chose to violently smother it anyway — believing that if you compartmentalized knowledge of this crime carefully enough, nobody could blame you for it, because _you yourself_ would no longer know. Yet they somehow always knew.

You now see _how_ they knew despite your astonishingly clever attempts to hide it. At the very deepest level, your mind is not separate from theirs. It's not that others can read your mind, per se, but your inner motivations inevitably leak into your outer reality; the two being fundamentally inseparable. Everything you do "in here" has an impact "out there," whether you see it or not.

The deepest motivation of all is to be of service to the Whole and not just to a part. This is a choice you make in every moment, whether you know it or not. Others can sense this choice at a subconscious level, and it influences their own. Your unwillingness to forsake them under any circumstances slowly reminds their darkness of the *one thing* it can never truly hide from. This is the *only* way that evil evaporates from our world. If you been freed from your own, it is only due to the grace of countless "others," whom you now honor by paying it forward.

There is no way to force others to see any of this; force being a manifestation of the same fundamental mistake. Those who are most powerful at inducing this realization in others are simply those who hold it most strongly themselves. They are literally incapable of feeling malice, contempt, or self-righteousness toward *anybody* for *any reason*, having thoroughly recognized them as weapons of the Darkness. Yet such people are not weak. They are unafraid to fiercely confront the darkness in others. 

This is true kindness, and it has nothing to do with being nice. It need not take any form in particular. Its only defining characteristic is that it is utterly free of self-deception. It surgically targets the parasite itself, instead of the confused being who unwittingly harbors it. The profound integrity of this act prevents their parasite from finding the excuse it would otherwise use to reinforce itself, and is weakened as a result. The more entrenched a person's darkness, the more fierce the kindness required to uproot it. It may be tough love, but it is always Love.

In the same way that your darkness can extend a secret handshake to others, your Light can do the same. It is nowhere near as violently pleasurable as subjugating them, but infinitely more valuable.

It exists only to help us hide our own darkness from ourselves by reinforcing it in others — allies, enemies, and bystanders alike.

The vast majority of dark behavior feels **absolutely nothing like evil**. It simply feels like "business as usual." We find all kinds of ways to justify self-serving behavior, using the sorry state of the world as an excuse. Corporations cheat us, so what's wrong with skimming from them? Our political opponents are morally defective, so why shouldn't we mock and shame them? An infinite variety of examples abounds, most of which are too subtle to capture in words.

It is not that skimming or shaming are inherently wrong, but we disregard that quiet voice warning us that we are lying to ourselves. The more we lie, the more we lose the ability to even detect that it *is* a lie. The "little voice" gets increasingly drowned out by clever justifications, which we fail to recognize as such — because why would our own minds lie to us? 

This is the trap in which modern humanity is caught. We have abandoned our inner knowing for clever judgments, writing off such knowing as religious myth.

</p>

Every time any one of us makes this mistake — which happens *far more often* than we realize — we are strengthening the same capacity in everyone else. The dark lies that politicians use to foment wars are made of the very same "stuff" as the lies we tell ourselves. Again, it's not just the same *kind* of stuff. Every act of self-deception gets woven into the very fabric of our reality, accumulating in the body politic, reconfiguring itself, eventually erupting in the form of atrocities that we feel *absolutely no connection* to — and which then serve as justification for *more*.

Without recognizing our own role in all this, it is impossible to do actual good in the world. Instead, we will continually buy into whichever narratives sound best — never recognizing that no matter how "good" they are, we are secretly just feeding the Beast. If we really want to know whether a cause is "good" or not, we cannot simply evaluate its *contents*. We must be able to feel into its *origin.* **So much suffering** could be avoided if we only learned to recognize this.

Thus, the entire fight against evil comes down to recognizing this "deeper knowing." For it is only by seeing how cleverly the darkness has manipulated our own minds that we discover the true meaning of *kindness* — and to appreciate its unique power to defeat our common nemesis.

> _For so long as the root of wickedness is hidden, it is strong. But when it is recognized, it is dissolved. When it is revealed, it perishes. ... It is powerful because we have not recognized it._ — The Gospel of Philip

There can be moments in life — such as during psychedelic trips, near-death experiences, or deep meditation or prayer — when you are confronted with the full depths of your own self-deception. You are shown every single instance where you skirted your conscience; every act of lying to yourself for your own personal gain. You are brought face-to-face with all the harm you've ever perpetrated from time immemorial, and it is more than you could hope to clean up in a single lifetime. The pain is beyond what you can fathom; more than you can bear. How widely and quickly it spread! How many it affected! The darkness exploited your fear and pride, enabling you to do things you couldn't have if only you had been totally honest.

The guilt is overwhelming. But then it dawns on you: the only reason it hurts so much is that you never actually wanted to do this. It is only profound confusion that enabled it. Your whole being is absorbed into that part of you that never wanted to hurt anyone; never _could_ want such a thing. Then, suddenly, the full mass of darkness lifts from your mind. It feels like being freed of a demonic possession. Beneath it is a Light so vast that it defies description; an infinite Love for all of reality that excludes nothing and forsakes no-one. This Light is what you ultimately are — *wonder of wonders* — and surprisingly, *so is everyone else*.

In fact, you ultimately _are_ everyone and everything else, just pretending that you're not. One consciousness, peering out through countless eyes. There are many ways to say this, all of which sound absurd to the rational mind. But when you fully unveil the Light in yourself, you automatically see it in everyone else — including those who convincingly seem not to have any. This is what the darkness is trying to hide.

Everything we do to each other — or to Nature herself — we ultimately do to ourselves. It is impossible to benefit ourselves at the world's expense, because we *are* the world. How crazy to think otherwise! How foolish to judge others for not seeing it, when we couldn't see it yet ourselves! In fact, this is the only way we *could* judge them. 

We are continually shoving each other into the abyss to prevent others from waking up, because we're not ready to wake up ourselves. Seeing this, we lose all desire to "get away" with anything. Why would we want to? How did we ever think we could?
<p align="center" width="100%">

---

The strangest part is discovering how you simultaneously _knew_ all this and yet somehow _didn't_. You convinced yourself that your unkind behavior was "for the greater good," even as you knew better. You could always perceive the Light in the "bad people," but chose to violently smother it anyway — believing that if you compartmentalized knowledge of this crime carefully enough, nobody could blame you for it, because _you yourself_ would no longer know. Yet they somehow always knew.

You now see _how_ they knew despite your astonishingly clever attempts to hide it. At the very deepest level, your mind is not separate from theirs. It's not that others can read your mind, per se, but your inner motivations inevitably leak into your outer reality; the two being fundamentally inseparable. Everything you do "in here" has an impact "out there," whether you see it or not.

The deepest motivation of all is to be of service to the Whole and not just to a part. This is a choice you make in every moment, whether you know it or not. Others can sense this choice at a subconscious level, and it influences their own. Your unwillingness to forsake them under any circumstances slowly reminds their darkness of the *one thing* it can never truly hide from. This is the *only* way that evil evaporates from our world. If you been freed from your own, it is only due to the grace of countless "others," whom you now honor by paying it forward.

There is no way to force others to see any of this; force being a manifestation of the same fundamental mistake. Those who are most powerful at inducing this realization in others are simply those who hold it most strongly themselves. They are literally incapable of feeling malice, contempt, or self-righteousness toward *anybody* for *any reason*, having thoroughly recognized them as weapons of the Darkness. Yet such people are not weak. They are unafraid to fiercely confront the darkness in others. 

This is true kindness, and it has nothing to do with being nice. It need not take any form in particular. Its only defining characteristic is that it is utterly free of self-deception. It surgically targets the parasite itself, instead of the confused being who unwittingly harbors it. The profound integrity of this act prevents their parasite from finding the excuse it would otherwise use to reinforce itself, and is weakened as a result. The more entrenched a person's darkness, the more fierce the kindness required to uproot it. It may be tough love, but it is always Love.

In the same way that your darkness can extend a secret handshake to others, your Light can do the same. It is nowhere near as violently pleasurable as subjugating them, but infinitely more valuable.

If we ultimately are the Light, how on Earth did we get to this place that looks nothing like it? This process is extremely tricky to convey, because it doesn't fit into our culture's standard metaphysics. We began as undifferentiated Light, but then made the mistake of subtly turning away from it. Then, fearing that we'd lost contact with our _absolute_ goodness, we went out seeking for it _relatively_ — that is, at the expense of "others." This simultaneously *created* those "others," who we then felt compelled to violently defeat, in order to prove our own goodness and thereby return Home. But this just made things worse, and the whole thing quickly spiraled out of control. This is the apparent reality in which we now live.

The hardest thing to communicate about this story is that it does not unfold in what we normally conceive of as linear time. In a profound and surprising sense, every moment is the very first. Thus, every instant is an opportunity to rediscover our primordial Home, a place we never truly left. Each time we see this, we increasingly discover how our judgements of others are actually pointers back to an unhealed part of ourselves. As we heal ourselves, we discover how to heal our relationship with the "other," until it slowly dawns on us that there was never truly an "other."

The more we see this, the more we vow to hold the Light for these seeming others, even when — indeed, _especially_ when — they cannot hold it for themselves. Far from being a burden, we discover that this has always been our true purpose; our deepest calling. Every encounter with evil becomes an opportunity to strengthen our commitment to the Light.

Looked at this way, kindness is anything that brings us all closer to remembering the truth, and evil is anything that pushes us away from it. Forsaking others is thus always a form of evil. It is a form of forsaking ourselves, because we are not ready to come Home yet. If this language feels too religious for you, feel free to find your own framing. In the end, there is only one Truth.

> *Darkness cannot drive out darkness, only light can do that. Hate cannot drive out hate, only love can do that.* ― Martin Luther King, Jr.

Unlike the Light, the darkness is not a real entity. It is a profound absence masquerading as a presence. This is why it cannot be defeated by more absence. Yet make no mistake: it still behaves like a sinister presence. It manipulates our perception at such a fundamental level that we simply cannot fathom that we're being fooled. We're certain that we're seeing reality _as it is_. It is an _impossibly_ clever trick, but one we can learn to see through.

Revenge fantasy films, YouTube videos of "Karens getting owned," Facebook threads full of casual cruelty and jokes about "Darwin awards" — each is a breeding ground for our collective Demon. It all seeps into our physical reality, slowly poisoning it. Everything from our unhealthy air, water, and soil, to our myriad societal ills and the climate crisis itself, is ultimately an external manifestation of a sickness within. As long as we perceive it to exist only in others, we will never discover its hidden aspect in ourselves. This is in no way suggesting that we are all equally complicit. Yet we each have a unique role to play in leading us all back to the Light.

To be clear: it does no good to pretend that we can see the Light in others when we can't. Doing so can backfire miserably. Thus, both pretending to see the Light in others and overlooking it can be harmful. The only solution is to learn to *actually* see it, which happens as a natural consequence of unveiling our own. Similarly, it is astonishingly easy to lie to ourselves about whether our violent behavior is "radical kindness" or merely self-deception. This is a common way for the darkness to sneak in.

Perhaps the clearest measure of our ability to deceive ourselves is how much contempt we still feel for our enemies. To the degree that this potential is still present, we are susceptible to sliding down the dark path that has enabled every genocide, without ever realizing that we are. All that is required is the right — or wrong — confluence of circumstances. To believe yourself immune is the greatest of follies, and the surest indication that you are *not.*

---

There are vast and subtle networks of causality that we normally hide from ourselves, and that secretly drive the fate of the world. Everything we do makes a difference, in ways that we can hardly fathom. If we pay attention only to the surface activity, we miss out on the bulk of what actually shapes our reality. Evil can look sweet and pretty, while kindness sometimes looks nothing of the sort. It is impossible to know which is which — and easy to convince ourselves otherwise — until we have done the deep inner work that eradicates the core confusion. 

We each catch glimpses of the Light from time to time, and it is our duty to carry them into the world as best we are able. I wish I could tell you that I have completed the journey myself, but alas, I am a mere fledgling. I am still liable to mess things up royally, and I only ask that you hold my feet to the fire when I do — for all of our sakes. I promise to do the same for you.

May all beings be free from suffering and its causes. Amen.

> _For so long as the root of wickedness is hidden, it is strong. But when it is recognized, it is dissolved. When it is revealed, it perishes. ... It is powerful because we have not recognized it._ — The Gospel of Philip

Consider the "bad people" of the world — the murderers, rapists, child abusers; the greedy bankers, hypocritical CEOs, corrupt politicians, etc. Don't they seem *fundamentally different* from the rest of us — as though they are somehow *intrinsically* morally defective? Sure, the rest of us may occasionally get up to some trouble, but it's not the same thing at all.

The truth is that the aspect of your mind that lets you believe this is precisely the same aspect that allows the "bad people" to do what *they* do — and by giving in to yours, you *reinforce* that same capacity in them. This requires a bit of unpacking.

Think back to a time when you skirted your conscience — that is, behaved in a way that went against your own deepest values, but somehow convinced yourself was okay. It can be hard to admit that you've done this, but we all have. In that state, part of you knew *perfectly well* that you were doing wrong, but this knowledge was carefully hidden from conscious self-reflection, so that it didn't *feel* wrong. All you consciously heard were your own clever justifications.

It is precisely this state that has enabled *all the evil there ever was,* from the tiniest act of unkindness to the most horrific atrocity — and any time any one of us engages in it, we strengthen that same capacity in everyone else. By its very nature, the vast majority of this behavior is hidden from our conscious minds, so that we only see the very tip of the iceberg.

---

> _Be kind, for everyone you meet is fighting a great battle._ —Author unknown

Reflect on how it feels to mock and shame your political enemies. Part of you *knows* that you're judging them for a flaw that you yourself are highly susceptible to — but this is nearly impossible to admit. At the same time, your enemy can sense that this is what's really happening, and so it makes them see *you* as evil in response. This, in turn, convinces you that you were *right* about them: after all, only a *fundamentally defective* person could think that *you* are the evil one here.

The darkness in your mind — the thing that allows you to hide from your own conscience — is infinitely more clever than you can fathom. It secretly orchestrated this whole ruse. It hides itself perfectly from your own mind while sensitizing you to its presence in others, precisely so that you will treat them with contempt, thereby *strengthening* its grip on both of you, while leaving you each feeling like you were acting righteously.

This is an incredibly subtle point, and one that's easy to misunderstand. In fact, the darkness *needs* you to misunderstand. Of course evil actions must be "judged" — so long as judgement simply means wise discernment. And appropriate action must be taken, even if it requires outwardly violent behavior. None of this by itself creates darkness. But there is a kind of "inward violence" — best captured by the word *contempt* — that always sullies even the most well-intended behavior. This is contempt not just for beliefs or behaviors but for *people themselves*.

---

The hallmark of evil is that the perpetrator's mind is shielding them from perceiving the *life* in their victims — be they other people, animals, or nature at large. There can be moments in life — such as in deep meditation, or on psychedelics, or near-death experiences — where one can be shown the full depth of depravity possible in a mind. It is a profoundly harrowing experience. At the same time, one discovers that it is **exactly** the same trick that has enabled one's own contempt for the "bad people." Hating them is how I hide my own self-deception from myself, thereby ensuring that I never heal the one bit of darkness I actually have full power over.

Believe me when I say that **nothing** is more painful than being shown how I've been shoving my fellow beings deeper into the abyss while claiming not to know what I was doing. I've been *smothering* their inner Light by pretending they don't have any. This makes me the **ultimate** hypocrite. I saw how every bit of news that triggers my contemptuous outrage is actually a place where my *own* unkindness has leaked out into the world, enabling me to safely judge it from afar. Again, the key word is *contemptuous.* There is nothing wrong with outrage, per se.

The darkness *needs* you to see yourself as different and special — if only in the sense of being "good person" — because once you do, the rest is all but guaranteed. It is always the same trick, and it always has the same effect. You *will* license yourself to engage in subtly self-serving behaviors that you will not recognize as such — and by doing so, secretly license others to do the same. And because you won't know that you've done this, you will then judge them for it, reinforcing the whole cycle without any awareness of your own complicity.

> _And no wonder, for even Satan masquerades as an angel of light. So it is not strange that his ministers also masquerade as ministers of righteousness._ —2 Corinthians 11:14-16

This is why some people fear the existence of an "evil global conspiracy" pulling the strings behind the scenes. The darkness in of all of our minds is indeed conspiring, behaving more like a singular *distributed malevolent entity*. The Christians know it as the Devil, and the Buddhists call it the Ego. It is the *primordial* evil conspiracy; the one to which all the rest owe their existence, and to which they all ultimately filter up. Every attempt to destroy it without being free of it yourself only ends up strengthening it, thus causing you to externalize it *even harder*.

This is why there is no substitute for evicting the darkness from your own mind first. Until then, you are always liable to run directly into this trap — and you will almost certainly not realize it until it's too late. You will then have to rely on someone wiser than yourself to help pull you out. Everyone else will be too busy contemptuously judging *you,* not realizing what *they* are doing.

The darkness is like a parasite — and like all parasites, it can be evicted. What lies underneath —what you ultimately *are* in your innermost being — is an infinite Love for all of Reality. Not a gentle, passive love, but a **ferocious compassion** that excludes nothing and forsakes no-one. It can manifest as fearsome wrath when necessary to protect the Whole, but its root is always Love; never malice or contempt.

This Love **is** all of Reality: One Life, peering through countless eyes, longing to come Home to itself; to remember itself. That is what you are — what everyone is — which is why your deepest longing is to be of service to the Whole. This is why any harm you cause others, or Nature herself, ultimately harms you; and why forsaking them ultimately only forsakes yourself.

---

To be clear: there are people whose infection runs so deep that naively "trying to see the good" in them can backfire miserably. Thus, pretending to see their Light when you can't, or believing they have none, both lead to terrible outcomes. The only solution is to learn to **actually** see it in them — a capacity that awakens naturally as you unveil the Light within yourself. The more you do this, the more you are able to subdue their darkness without accidentally reinforcing it. A mind that is free of self-deception simply cannot feel malice, contempt, or self-righteousness, no matter the circumstances, because it sees where these inevitably lead.

I know this may all sound bizarre, but part of you recognizes this truth, even if your mind describes it in different language. Find that part of you and trust it above all else. Everything that distracts from this inner knowing, every justification for contempt or self-deception, is a whisper from the darkness. By remaining steadfastly connected to this source of Good within, you not only heal yourself but contribute to the healing of the world – achieving far more in the true "fight against Evil" than all the cunning strategies your darkness could ever devise.

May all beings be free of suffering and its causes. Amen.

> _Be kind, for everyone you meet is fighting a great battle._ —Author unknown

Reflect on how it feels to mock and shame your enemies. Part of you *knows* that you are not fundamentally superior to them; that any harm they cause is the result of a kind of self-deception that you yourself are susceptible to. But this is nearly impossible to admit to oneself. Still, your enemy can sense what you're really up to, making them see *you* as evil in response. This, in turn, convinces you that you were *right* about them: after all, only a *fundamentally defective* person could think that *you* are the evil one.

The darkness in your mind — the thing that allows you to hide from your conscience —  secretly orchestrated this ruse. It telegraphed itself to your enemy while hiding itself from you, specifically to provoke their darkness in a way that would leave you both feeling righteous. It is like a *secret handshake* between your darkness and theirs.

Of course evil actions should be "judged" — so long as judgement simply means wise discernment. And appropriate action *must* be taken, even if it requires outwardly violent behavior. But we rarely leave it at that. The darkness in our mind usually finds a way to inject itself into our behavior in a way that we can plausibly deny. We weren't *provoking* their darkness — we were fighting it!

But that's what contempt *is*: our darkness leaking in a way that feels *righteous*. To be clear, this means contempt for *people.* Contempt for beliefs or behaviors can sometimes be wielded wisely. Mockery and shaming aren't inherently wrong — but we almost always inject them with contempt, turning them vehicles of our darkness.

The hallmark of evil is that the perpetrator's mind is shielding them from perceiving the *life* in their victims — be they other people, animals, or nature at large.

Again, the key word is *contemptuous* — there is nothing wrong with outrage itself.

The darkness *needs* us to see ourselves as different and special — because once we do, the rest is all but guaranteed. Ironically, simply by seeing ourselves as *fundamentally good* people — in contrast to those who are *fundamentally bad* — we will *necessarily* license ourselves to engage in some subtly self-serving behavior that we will not recognize as such — and by doing so, secretly license those "bad people" to do the same. We then judge them for it, reinforcing the whole cycle without any awareness of our own complicity.

This is how the darkness spreads.

There is no substitute for evicting the darkness from your own mind first. Until then, you are always liable to run into this trap. We all think we would have been *fighting* the Nazis instead of being one of them — but to the degree that we can still feel contempt for them (or anyone else), we've got it backwards. That is the surest sign that we're susceptible to going down a dark path ourselves.
