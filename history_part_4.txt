_[Warning: This piece deals with issues around the nature of evil. It is **not** light reading.]_

When wise people urge compassion for evildoers, they're not suggesting that we be _nice_. They're warning us about an insidious trap that the whole world is presently caught in.

Consider [this horrifying story from 2012](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/southamerica/brazil/9005835/Loggers-burned-Amazon-tribe-girl-alive.html):

> _Loggers in Brazil captured an eight-year-old girl from one of the Amazon's last uncontacted tribes and burned her alive as part of a campaign to force the indigenous population from its land [...]_

Reading this would make any sane person profoundly angry and heartbroken for the girl, her tribe, and humanity. It makes us want to do everything in our power to ensure this kind of thing never happens again — which may require punishing or even harming the perpetrators. At the same time, we may feel a desire to harm them quite independently of any good it will bring: pure old-fashioned vengeance.

These two motivations — compassion and malice — arise from very different aspects of mind. But they can be extremely difficult to tell apart — particularly because we often dress up the latter to make it seem respectable; as though it is "for the greater good." We tell ourselves that it doesn't matter which intention is driving our behavior, because only the _result_ is important.

_This confusion is how evil sneaks into the world, undetected._

<p align="center" width="100%">
    <img width="300px" src="img/half-evil.png"> 
</p>

People are _exquisitely_ sensitive to our motivations, and malice makes us look evil — because it _is_ (as we shall see). We may not even be aware of how it comes across, but others are (if only subconsciously), and it powerfully evokes _their_ malice. Our allies join in the frenzy, while our enemies feel compelled to fight _our_ evil in return. Even if it scares them into changing their behavior (in public, anyway), the darkness has been embedded deeper into their minds, and _will_ manifest in some way — though perhaps far enough away in time and space that we can disown all complicity.

The world becomes darker as a result. This isn't an unfortunate side effect of our well-intentioned behavior: the whole thing was secretly orchestrated by a sinister aspect within our minds. The way this works is _insanely_ clever.

<p align="center" width="100%">
    <img width="300px" src="img/evil-above-world.png"> 
</p>

People are only able to misbehave due to a kind of self-deception: part of them knows perfectly well that what they're doing is wrong, but that "wrongness" is cleverly hidden from conscious self-reflection. Part of us knows this, and that our malice will only deepen their self-deception, thus enabling more evil. But we hide this knowledge from ourselves and forge ahead anyway, telling ourselves that our behavior is righteous. _This is self-deception_ — and it makes them perceive us as evil for precisely the same reason that we did them, leading to a downward spiral into Hell.

It's not the _harm itself_ that triggered this spiral, but the malice with which we did it. Harming them out of fierce compassion may still provoke some form of retaliation, but the profoundly benevolent intent prevents their self-deception mechanism from finding the "hook" it needs to reinforce itself.

<p align="center" width="100%">
    <img width="300px" src="img/devil-vs-devil.png"> 
</p>

If it is really this simple, then why aren't we already doing it?

Part of us _knows_ that we're not intrinsically better than anyone, but we hide this from ourselves. We use malice to keep the "bad people" trapped in delusion, so that we can prove ourselves morally superior. Unfortunately, baiting people into evil is hardly "morally superior," and so we must hide this, too, in a tightening noose of deception. It collapses in on itself like a black hole, preventing us from ever suspecting our dark motives.

Let's look at this from another angle.

---

> _And no wonder, for even Satan masquerades as an angel of light._ —2 Corinthians 11:14

You know the classic image of the angel and devil sitting on our shoulders? It's _almost_ accurate, except for two things. First, the angel isn't really external to you, but represents your true nature as compassion. In a deep sense, it *is* you. The devil is external; a kind of parasite[^intrinsic]. But it doesn't just whisper obviously-bad ideas in your ear; it pretends to be your inner angel, and alters your very perception so that evil appears righteous.

<p align="center" width="100%">
    <img width="300px" src="img/parasite.png"> 
</p>

> _Be kind, for everyone you meet is fighting a great battle._ —Author unknown

Your self-image prevents you from being cruel to just anyone, so your devil does something very clever: it searches for people whose "battle" is hard for you to see, and makes their devil appear _intrinsic_. This way, they appear _fundamentally morally defective,_ and thus worthy of malice.

Long before it can justify outright cruelty, our devil finds people who we can treat with at least a little bit of contempt. The game is the same: use it to prod people into becoming increasingly worse, until we _can_ justify cruelty.

We don't have enough power to accomplish much alone — but luckily, our devils are coordinating: mine baits yours into baiting mine ... Enemies trigger each other, and "allies" embolden each other, but secretly _everyone_ doing this is allied in evil. In fact, if you look closely, our devils behave more like outgrowths of a single _shared_ Devil that is continually manipulating _all_ of our minds.

It is not just a religious invention: I think that everyone who introspects carefully enough eventually perceives this "distributed malevolent entity" which has a kind of intelligence and volition of its own that, even if not _literally_ true, explain its seemingly-coordinated behavior terrifyingly well.

It continually drives us toward various kinds of Armageddon: situations in which everyone is violently proving just how righteous they are. This is why the US is headed toward civil war without anyone recognizing their own complicity, and it explains bitter divorces in which each side feels like the exclusive victim / hero.

<p align="center" width="100%">
    <img width="300px" src="img/shared-devil.png"> 
</p>

It is that primordial "evil global conspiracy," to which all the rest ultimately owe their existence — and _we_ are its unwitting minions. Every attempt to maliciously subdue it "out there" just strengthens it, because such behavior is only ever initiated _by_ it, even though it makes us believe that it was initiated by us. 

**Any** time you feel malice, hatred, contempt, or even self-righteousness toward another being; any time you see them as fundamentally defective or inferior; any time you are tempted to divide the world into the (fundamentally) "good" and "bad," you are being manipulated into feeding the Beast. People are certainly trapped by darkness to varying degrees, but it is never intrinsic.

<p align="center" width="100%">
    <img width="300px" src="img/good-vs-bad.png"> 
</p>

To be clear: there may well be groups of particularly "bad" people who conspire to cause great harm, but their existence wouldn't be possible if the rest of us weren't feeding the source — and conversely, it is _inevitable_ given that we are. **We must hold such people accountable**, but when we do this with contempt, we are reinforcing the conditions that effectively _compel_ their existence.

<p align="center" width="100%">
    <img width="300px" src="img/evil-conspiracy.png"> 
</p>

Our true enemy is not other people, but the dark "entity" that has captured _all_ of our minds. By keeping our attention fixated perpetually outward, it ensures that we never introspect deeply enough to discover how it works, and thereby discover how to end it. The Buddhists call it the ego: the collection of habits we use to misperceive ourselves as separate and special.

> *The shadow is a moral problem that challenges the whole ego-personality, for no one can become conscious of the shadow without considerable moral effort. To become conscious of it involves recognizing the dark aspects of the personality as present and real. This act is the essential condition for any kind of self-knowledge.* —Carl Jung

The only way out of this trap is to see beyond the ego, to your fundamentally compassionate nature. When you see this, you cannot help but see it in everyone else, too — because in an astonishing sense, [they _are_ you](unity.md). From here, you cannot possibly harbor malice or contempt. This frees you up to perceive the hidden causes of their self-deception, enabling you to do something real about it. This is not fully developed until enlightenment, but we all can taste it at all times.

Compassion doesn't mean being _nice_. It can outwardly be as fierce (or violent[^dalai-lama-gun], or even _apparently_ contemptuous) as the situation warrants, but these behaviors come from a completely different source. People can sense your motivation even when you think they can't — in fact, even when _you_ (consciously) can't — and it makes all the difference in the world.

_This_ is why wise people urge compassion for evildoers: the only alternative is to be — and spread — evil (usually while convinced that it is righteous).

Compassion doesn't always know what the most beneficial behavior _is_. It merely ensures that you are behaving in a way that is aligned with your deepest values; your profound love for the world. Determining the most effective behavior requires _wisdom_, which is a vast topic, and beyond the scope of this work. There is no doubt that dealing with profound evil in the real world is _hard._

> *Such a man knows that whatever is wrong in the world is also in himself, and if he only learns to deal with his own shadow, he has done something real for the world. He has succeeded in shouldering at least an infinitesimal part of the gigantic, unsolved problems of our day.* —Carl Jung

<p align="center" width="100%">
    <img width="600px" src="img/buddha-and-demons.png"> 
</p>

Enlightenment may be a lofty goal, but we can start small, by changing social norms. We can teach our children that contempt for "bad people" isn't what it seems to be, and refuse to join our allies when we can sense that their motivation isn't "clean." Contempt[^contempt] must go the way of all other forms of evil if we are to defeat our true enemy.

## Footnotes

[^contempt]: Specifically, we mean (genuine) contempt for *people*. Contempt for ideas or behaviors can actually be healthy, as perhaps can (apparent) contempt that is rooted in genuine compassion.

[^intrinsic]: You may wonder how it is possible to know that evil is not intrinsic to other people's minds, but for our purposes it's more important to see that (1) our _perception_ of their intrinsic defectiveness is our own projection, and (2) our own darkness gives us the capacity to devolve into a condition in which others would be utterly convinced that _ours_ is intrinsic.

[^dalai-lama-gun]: The Dalai Lama was once asked what you should do if a gunman is trying to shoot you and you have a gun. [He said "shoot back."](https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/dalai-gun/)

_Warning: This piece is about the nature of good and evil. It is **not** light reading._

When wise people urge compassion for evildoers, they're not suggesting that we be _nice_. They're warning us about an insidious trap that we keep falling into, and that is destroying our civilization.

Consider [this horrifying story from 2012](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/southamerica/brazil/9005835/Loggers-burned-Amazon-tribe-girl-alive.html):

At the same time, you may feel a desire to harm them quite _independently_ of any good it will bring: pure old-fashioned vengeance.

We usually dress up the latter to make it seem respectable; like it is "for the greater good." We tell ourselves that it doesn't matter which intention is driving our behavior; that only the _result_ matters. Similarly, we feel more than okay being casually cruel to anyone we perceive as vaguely "bad," because we are good — and therefore such behavior _must_ be good. We even calculate _how_ it will be good (for example, by shutting them up).

This profound confusion is how evil sneaks into the world undetected.

<p align="center" width="100%">
    <img width="300px" src="img/half-evil.png"> 
</p>

As much as we try to hide our underlying motivations — even from ourselves — other people are _exquisitely_ sensitive to them, if only subconsciously. Malice makes us look evil — _because it is_, as we shall see — and it powerfully evokes _their_ malice in response.

Whatever storyline was justifying our target's behavior in the first place, it is now reinforced — because they can plausibly claim to be _fighting evil_. Our allies become more bloodlusted, too. Even if our target changes their behavior (in public, anyway), the darkness has been embedded deeper into their mind, and this _will_ manifest in some way and ripple out into the world — and we will be able to disown all complicity.

The world becomes darker as a result. But this isn't an unfortunate side effect of our well-intentioned behavior: it was secretly orchestrated by a sinister aspect within our minds. The way this works is _insanely_ clever.

<p align="center" width="100%">
    <img width="300px" src="img/evil-above-world.png">

People are only able to misbehave due to a kind of self-deception: part of them knows perfectly well that what they're doing is wrong, but that "wrongness" is cleverly hidden from conscious self-reflection. Part of us knows this, and that our malice will only exacerbate the problem, but we hide this knowledge from ourselves — because our identity as "good people" depends on them not "seeing the light," and who could blame us for not helping them see it? _This is self-deception_ — which makes them perceive us as evil for precisely the same reason that we did them, triggering a downward spiral into Hell.

It's not the _harm itself_ that caused this spiral, but the malice with which we did it. Harming them out of fierce compassion may still provoke some form of retaliation, but the profoundly benevolent intent prevents their self-deception mechanism from finding the "hook" it needs to reinforce itself.

<p align="center" width="100%">

</p>

If it is really this simple, then why aren't we already doing it?

Part of us _knows_ that we're not intrinsically better than anyone — but given how low people can sink, this is painful to admit, so we hide it. We use malice to keep people trapped in delusion, so that we can stay safely morally superior. Unfortunately, pushing people into the dark is hardly "morally superior," so we must hide this, too, in an ever-tightening noose of deception that collapses in on itself like a black hole, preventing us from ever suspecting what we're really doing.

Of course, we can't push just _anyone_ into the dark. We need plausible deniability...

You know the classic image of the angel and devil sitting on our shoulders? It's _almost_ accurate, except for two things. First, the angel isn't really external to you, but represents your true nature as compassion. In a deep sense, it *is* you (as we will discover later). The devil is external; a kind of parasite[^intrinsic]. But it doesn't just whisper obviously-bad ideas in your ear; it alters your very perception and pretends to be your inner angel.

<p align="center" width="100%">

</p>

> _Be kind, for everyone you meet is fighting a great battle._ —Author unknown

Your angel knows that this is how things work, and that even the most "evil" person is really under the sway of a parasite; one held in place by some "battle" invisible not only to you, but probably also them. As hard as it may be to evict, it's never _impossible._ Your devil makes it _appear_ impossible; as though their evil is intrinsic. They are _fundamentally defective_. This way, you don't need to worry about whether your behavior "drives it deeper," for there is no such thing.

But it gets crazier: your devil also knows that your perceiving them this way will cause them to perceive you in the same way — because your devil and theirs are identical. In fact, they're not just identical, but behave more like outgrowths of a single _shared_ Devil that is continually manipulating _all_ of our minds.

<p align="center" width="100%">
    <img width="300px" src="img/shared-devil.png"> 
</p>

This is not just a religious invention: anyone who introspects carefully enough eventually perceives this "distributed malevolent entity" with a kind of intelligence and volition of its own that, even if not _literally_ true, explain its seemingly-coordinated behavior terrifyingly well. 

It continually drives us toward various kinds of Armageddon: situations in which everyone is violently proving how righteous they are, once and for all. It is why the US is headed toward civil war without anyone recognizing their own complicity, and why there are bitter [divorces](https://www.gottman.com/blog/this-one-thing-is-the-biggest-predictor-of-divorce/) in which each side feels like the exclusive victim / hero. Nearly the whole world is caught in its terrible sway, evil provoking "righteous" evil at nearly every turn; everyone pointing fingers at everyone else, studiously overlooking its true source.

It is that primordial "evil global conspiracy" to which all the rest ultimately owe their existence — and _we_ are its unwitting minions. Every attempt to maliciously subdue it "out there" just strengthens it, because such behavior is only ever initiated _by_ it, while making us believe that it was initiated by us. 

**Any** time you feel malice, hatred, contempt, or even self-righteousness toward another being; any time you see them as fundamentally defective or inferior; any time you are tempted to divide the world into the (fundamentally) "good" and "bad," or to forsake anyone, you are being manipulated into feeding the Beast.

<p align="center" width="100%">
    <img width="300px" src="img/good-vs-bad.png"> 
</p>

To be clear: there are surely groups of particularly deluded people who conspire to cause great harm, but their existence wouldn't be possible if the rest of us weren't feeding the source — and conversely, it is _inevitable_ given that we are. **We must hold such people accountable**, but when we do this with contempt, we are reinforcing the conditions that effectively _compel_ their existence. If you look carefully enough, you will find your finger in their pies.

<p align="center" width="100%">

</p>

Our true enemy is not other people, but the dark "entity" that has captured _all_ of our minds. By keeping our attention fixated perpetually outward, it ensures that we never introspect deeply enough to discover how it works, and how to end it. From another perspective, it is what the Buddhists call the ego: the collection of habits we have developed that cause us to misperceive ourselves as separate and special.

> *The shadow is a moral problem that challenges the whole ego-personality, for no one can become conscious of the shadow without considerable moral effort. To become conscious of it involves recognizing the dark aspects of the personality as present and real. This act is the essential condition for any kind of self-knowledge.* —Carl Jung

The only way out of this trap is to see beyond the ego, to your fundamentally compassionate nature. When you see this, you cannot help but see it in everyone else, too — because in an astonishing sense, [they _are_ you](unity.md). This perception is not fully unveiled until enlightenment, but we can all taste it. Ultimately, all self-deception boils down to willful ignorance of this fact — and all unkindness reinforces it. Why "willful"? The remarkable punchline is that _part of you has known this all along._ Think of this piece as a reminder.

From that clarity of perception, you cannot possibly harbor malice or contempt. That enables you to perceive the hidden causes of their self-deception, allowing you to do something real about it. That's what compassion (aka kindness) is.

To be clear: this doesn't mean being _nice_. It can outwardly be as fierce (or violent[^dalai-lama-gun], or even _apparently_ contemptuous) as the situation warrants, but these behaviors come from a completely different source. People can sense your motivation even when you think they can't — in fact, even when _you_ (consciously) can't — and it makes all the difference in the world.

_This_ is why wise people urge compassion for evildoers: the _only_ alternative is to join them in evil.

Compassion doesn't always know what the most beneficial behavior _is_. It merely ensures that you are behaving in a way that is aligned with your deepest values; your profound love for the world. Determining the most effective behavior requires _wisdom_, which is a vast topic, and beyond the scope of this work. There is no doubt that dealing with profound evil in the real world is _hard_, and I am sorry not to be able to provide much guidance here.

> *Such a man knows that whatever is wrong in the world is also in himself, and if he only learns to deal with his own shadow, he has done something real for the world. He has succeeded in shouldering at least an infinitesimal part of the gigantic, unsolved problems of our day.* —Carl Jung

    <img width="600px" src="img/buddha-and-demons.png"> 
</p>

Enlightenment may be a lofty goal, but we can start small, by changing social norms. We can teach our children the difference between "kind" and "nice," and explain why kindness is _always_ the right motivation in all circumstances — even if it must express itself in a fierce (and occasionally violent) way. We can refuse to join our allies when they're caught up in the trap of contempt[^contempt], and remind them of a better way.

We _all_ have a role to play in defeating our true enemy — and it all begins with us.

## Footnotes

[^contempt]: Specifically, we mean (genuine) contempt for *people*. Contempt for ideas or behaviors can actually be healthy, as perhaps can (apparent) contempt that is rooted in genuine compassion.

[^intrinsic]: You may wonder how it is possible to know that evil is not intrinsic to other people's minds, but for our purposes it's more important to see that (1) our _perception_ of their intrinsic defectiveness is our own projection, and (2) our own darkness gives us the capacity to devolve into a condition in which others would be utterly convinced that _ours_ is intrinsic.

_Warning: This piece is about the nature of good and evil. It is **not** light reading._

---

Sometimes it is only after the fact that we discover that we _always_ knew that something was wrong, even when we thought that it wasn't. Thus it can happen that we come to deeply regret behaviors that felt completely okay at the time, realizing (to our horror) that part of us knew better even as we engaged in them.

So it is with _all_ acts of unkindness, in the final analysis.

Something within you knows that kindness is always the right approach in every situation — including the ones where it seems "obviously" wrong. There's a part of you that wants to respond to the evils of the world by hardening your heart and becoming a tiny bit evil yourself. Of course, you probably don't think of it as "being evil." We tend to call it righteous retribution. But something deep within you knows that what's really happening is that the evil out there is taking root in here.

Every single time you feel malice, hatred, contempt, or _even self-righteousness_ toward anyone — no matter how "evil" — you are preparing to do something that you know will ultimately harm the world. The difficulty is in getting yourself to admit this.

The faster we all get our act together, the better. The fate of humanity depends on it.

---

Consider [this horrifying story from 2012](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/southamerica/brazil/9005835/Loggers-burned-Amazon-tribe-girl-alive.html):

> _Loggers in Brazil captured an eight-year-old girl from one of the Amazon's last uncontacted tribes and burned her alive as part of a campaign to force the indigenous population from its land [...]_

Can you feel the profound anger and heartbreak for the girl, her tribe, and humanity? It makes you want to do everything in your power to ensure this kind of thing never happens again — including punishing and maybe even harming the perpetrators if need be. At the same time, you may feel a desire to harm them quite _independently_ of any good it will bring: pure old-fashioned vengeance.

These two motivations — compassion and malice — arise from very different aspects of mind, but can be extremely difficult to tell apart. We usually dress up the latter to make it seem respectable; like it is "for the greater good." We tell ourselves that it doesn't matter which intention is driving our behavior; that only the _result_ matters. In fact, because we are "good people," pretty much any behavior is good by definition so long as our target is even vaguely "bad." If pressed, we can produce calculations _proving_ that it will produce a net good.

This profound confusion is how evil sneaks into the world undetected.

_Before I speak to your mind, let me speak to your heart. Imagine how dark and twisted a mind has to become to feel okay about doing what those loggers did. If you introspect carefully enough, you will find that pushing such a mind deeper into the abyss is every bit as malevolent as burning a girl alive. But we carefully hide this truth from ourselves, to avoid confronting something that we'd be much better off dealing with immediately. This isn't a judgement of you. It's an attempt at communicating a horrifying punchline that part of us already knows is coming sooner or later._

We can't calculate all the downstream effects of even our tiniest behavior, but we _can_ know when we are being evil — and the greatest gift we can give to the world is healing whatever is causing this confused behavior.

<p align="center" width="100%">
    <img width="300px" src="img/half-evil.png"> 
</p>

As much as we try to hide our underlying motivations — even from ourselves — other people are _exquisitely_ sensitive to them, if only subconsciously. Malice makes us look evil — _because it is_, as we shall see — and it powerfully evokes _their_ malice in response.

Whatever storyline was justifying our target's behavior in the first place is now reinforced, because they can plausibly claim to be _fighting evil_. Our allies become more bloodlusted, too. Even if our nastiness suppresses our target's behavior (in public, anyway), the darkness has been embedded deeper into their mind — and this _will_ manifest in some way and ripple out into the world, where we will be able to disavow any connection to it.

The world becomes darker as a result. But this isn't an unfortunate side effect of our well-intentioned behavior: it was secretly orchestrated by a sinister aspect within our minds. The way this works is _insanely_ clever.

<p align="center" width="100%">
    <img width="300px" src="img/evil-above-world.png"> 
</p>

People are only able to misbehave due to a kind of self-deception: part of them knows perfectly well that what they're doing is wrong, but that "wrongness" is cleverly hidden from conscious self-reflection. Part of us knows this, and that our malice will only exacerbate the problem, but we hide this knowledge from ourselves — because our identity as "good people" depends on them not "seeing the light," and who could blame us for not helping them see it? _This is self-deception_ — which makes them perceive us as evil for precisely the same reason that we did them, triggering a downward spiral into Hell.

It's not merely _harming_ them that caused this spiral, but the malice with which we did it. It is entirely possible to harm people out of fierce compassion for the world, but it feels nothing like malice. Others can sense the profoundly benevolent intent, and it prevents their self-deception mechanism from finding the "hook" it needs to reinforce itself. In fact, it may well plant the seed of introspection, which will _weaken_ the source of evil. Your example matters far more than you know.

<p align="center" width="100%">
    <img width="300px" src="img/devil-vs-devil.png"> 
</p>

If it is really this simple, then why aren't we already doing it?

Part of us _knows_ that we're not intrinsically better than anyone — but given how low people can sink, this is painful to admit, so we hide it. We use malice to keep people trapped in delusion, so that we can stay safely morally superior. Unfortunately, pushing people into the dark is hardly "morally superior," so we must hide this, too, in an ever-tightening noose of deception that collapses in on itself like a black hole, preventing us from ever suspecting what we're really doing.

Somewhere down this dark path, we will lose even the _pretense_ of being good. That's where the "evil people" are trapped. The only way to inoculate yourself against it is to see how susceptible you are to it — and it begins with seeing how it arises in the first place.

As hard as it may be to evict, it's never _impossible._ Your devil makes it _appear_ impossible; as though their evil is intrinsic. They seem _fundamentally defective_. This triggers our deep-seated (but ham-fisted) instinct of "see evil, smash evil."

Your devil _also_ knows that this instinct appears evil to others (because it _is_), and so it knows that it will trigger the same reflex in them. It knows this because your devil and theirs are identical. In fact, they're not just identical, but behave more like outgrowths of a single collective entity that is continually manipulating _all_ of our minds — the Devil, if you will.

What if your fight to improve the world is doing more harm than good? And what if there's a part of you that already knows this but doesn't want you to find out?

Consider [this horrifying story from 2012](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/southamerica/brazil/9005835/Loggers-burned-Amazon-tribe-girl-alive.html):

Part of us _knows_ that we're not intrinsically better than anyone — but given how low people can sink, this is painful to admit, so we hide it. We use malice to keep people trapped in delusion, so that we can prove that we are morally superior. Unfortunately, pushing people into the dark is hardly "morally superior," so we must hide this intention from ourselves, too, convincing ourselves that we are only "fighting evil." This results in an ever-tightening noose of deception that collapses in on itself like a black hole, preventing us from ever suspecting what we're really doing.

Somewhere down this dark path, we will lose even the _pretense_ of being good. That's where the "evil people" find themselves trapped. The only way to protect against this slippery slope is to recognize how it works, and how susceptible you are to it.

> _And no wonder, for even Satan masquerades as an angel of light._ —2 Corinthians 11:14

You know the classic image of the angel and devil sitting on our shoulders? It's _almost_ accurate, except for two things. First, the angel isn't really external to you, but represents your true nature as compassion. In a deep sense, it *is* you. The devil is external; a kind of parasite[^intrinsic]. But it doesn't just whisper obviously-bad ideas in your ear; it alters your very perception and pretends to be your inner angel.

<p align="center" width="100%">
    <img width="300px" src="img/parasite.png"> 
</p>

> _Be kind, for everyone you meet is fighting a great battle._ —Author unknown

Your angel already knows all this, and that even the most "evil" person is merely under the sway of a powerful parasite; one held in place by some "battle" invisible not only to you, but probably even to them. As hard as it may be to evict it, it's never _impossible._ But your devil makes it _appear_ impossible; as though their evil is intrinsic. This way, they seem _fundamentally defective_, and therefore worthy of malice. Thus begins the dehumanization.

Your devil knows that this hardening of your heart will appear evil to others — because it is the very _essence_ of evil — and so it knows that it will trigger the same reflex in them. It knows this because your devil and theirs are identical. In fact, they're more than just identical: they behave more like outgrowths of a single collective entity that is continually manipulating _all_ of our minds — the Devil, if you will.

<p align="center" width="100%">
    <img width="300px" src="img/shared-devil.png"> 
</p>

This is not just a religious invention: anyone who introspects carefully enough eventually perceives this "distributed malevolent entity" with a kind of intelligence and volition of its own that, even if not _literally_ true, explain its seemingly-coordinated behavior terrifyingly well. 

This "being" continually drives humanity toward various kinds of Armageddon: situations in which everyone is violently proving just how righteous they are. It is why the US is headed toward civil war without anyone recognizing their own complicity, and explains bitter [divorces](https://www.gottman.com/blog/this-one-thing-is-the-biggest-predictor-of-divorce/) in which each side feels like the exclusive victim / hero. Nearly the whole world is caught in its terrible sway, evil provoking "righteous" retribution at every turn without anyone ever noticing who is really in charge.

It is that primordial "evil global conspiracy" to which all the rest ultimately owe their existence — and _we_ are its unwitting minions. Every attempt to maliciously subdue it "out there" just strengthens it, because such behavior is only ever initiated _by_ it — though it makes us believe that it was initiated by us, in the service of Good.

**Any** time you feel malice, hatred, contempt, or self-righteousness toward another being; any time you see them as fundamentally defective or inferior; any time you are tempted to divide the world into the (fundamentally) "good" and "bad," or to forsake anyone, you are feeding the insatiable Beast.

<p align="center" width="100%">
    <img width="300px" src="img/good-vs-bad.png"> 
</p>

To be clear: there are surely groups of particularly deluded people who conspire to cause great harm, but their existence wouldn't be possible if the rest of us weren't busy feeding the source — and conversely, it is _completely inevitable_ given that we are. **We must hold such people accountable**, but when we do this with contempt, we are reinforcing the very conditions that _compel_ their existence. If you could trace all the subtle threads of causality weaving through the wrold, you would find your finger in countless evil pies.

<p align="center" width="100%">
    <img width="300px" src="img/evil-conspiracy.png">

Our true enemy is not other people, but the dark "entity" that has captured _all_ of our minds. By keeping our attention fixated perpetually outward, it ensures that we never introspect deeply enough to notice our own role. This distraction is roughly what the Buddhists call the ego: the collection of habits we have developed to overlook our intimate interconnection with all of reality, so that we may elevate ourselves at its expense. It [pretends to _be_ you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gg8JYYyWSPg), but it is not your friend.

> *The shadow is a moral problem that challenges the whole ego-personality, for no one can become conscious of the shadow without considerable moral effort. To become conscious of it involves recognizing the dark aspects of the personality as present and real. This act is the essential condition for any kind of self-knowledge.* —Carl Jung

The only way out of this trap is to see beyond the ego, to your fundamentally compassionate nature. When you see this, you cannot help but see it in everyone else, too — because in an astonishing and heart-wrenching sense, [everyone **is** you](unity.md). This perception is not fully unveiled until enlightenment, but we can all taste it at all times. Ultimately, all self-deception boils down to willful ignorance of this fact — and all unkindness reinforces it. Why do I say "willful" ignorance? Because you eventually discover that _part of you has known this all along._ Think of this piece as a reminder.

From that clarity of perception, you cannot possibly harbor malice or contempt. You see it for the pure nonsense that it is. This enables you to perceive the hidden causes of people's self-deception, allowing you to do something real about it. That's what compassion (aka kindness) is.

To repeat: it doesn't mean being _nice_. It can outwardly be as fierce (or violent[^dalai-lama-gun], or even _apparently_ contemptuous) as the situation warrants, but these behaviors come from a completely different source, and have a completely different effect on all minds involved — again, rippling outward into the world, in ways that we can't see or predict.

_This_ is why wise people urge compassion for evildoers: the only alternative is to join them in evil, usually while flawlessly convinced that you're helping.

To be clear, compassion doesn't always know what the most beneficial behavior _is_; it merely ensures that you are not falling into the many seductive traps of your darkness. Determining the most effective behavior requires _wisdom_, which is a vast topic, and beyond the scope of this work. Compassion may be no easier to acquire than wisdom, but it is much simpler: there is a single place within your mind that you can turn to and _know._ So much trouble could be avoided if we just remembered to **look** — especially when we were most convinced that we didn't need to.

> *Such a man knows that whatever is wrong in the world is also in himself, and if he only learns to deal with his own shadow, he has done something real for the world. He has succeeded in shouldering at least an infinitesimal part of the gigantic, unsolved problems of our day.* —Carl Jung

    <img width="600px" src="img/buddha-and-demons.png"> 
</p>

Enlightenment may be a lofty goal to expect of humanity, but we can start small, by changing social norms. We can teach our children the difference between "kind" and "nice," and explain the sense in which kindness is _always_ the right motivation in all circumstances. We can refuse to join our allies when they're caught up in the traps of contempt[^contempt] and malice, and serve as an example of a better way.

[^intrinsic]: You may wonder how it is possible to know that evil is not intrinsic to other people's minds, but for our purposes it's more important to see that (1) our _perception_ of their intrinsic defectiveness is our own projection, and (2) our own darkness gives us the capacity to devolve into a condition in which others would be utterly convinced that _ours_ is intrinsic.

How do we not lose our hearts in the face of evil? And why _should_ we not?

Ultimately, no answer is as satisfying as discovering for yourself the astonishing ruse by which evil has captured our hearts.

---

Consider [this horrifying story from 2012](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/southamerica/brazil/9005835/Loggers-burned-Amazon-tribe-girl-alive.html):

> _Loggers in Brazil captured an eight-year-old girl from one of the Amazon's last uncontacted tribes and burned her alive as part of a campaign to force the indigenous population from its land [...]_

<p align="center" width="100%">
    <img width="300px" src="img/tribe.png"> 
</p>

Can you feel the profound anger and heartbreak for the girl, her tribe, and humanity? It makes you want to do everything in your power to ensure this kind of thing never happens again — including punishing and maybe even harming the perpetrators if need be. At the same time, you may feel a desire to harm them quite _independently_ of any good it will bring: pure old-fashioned vengeance.

These two motivations — compassion and malice — arise from very different aspects of mind, but can be extremely difficult to tell apart. We usually dress up the latter to make it seem respectable; as though it is "for the greater good." We convince ourselves that it doesn't matter which intention is driving our behavior; that only the result matters — and _fighting evil_ could only result in a net good, however it is accomplished.

This profound confusion is how evil sneaks into the world, undetected.

_Before I speak to your mind, let me speak to your heart. Imagine how dark and twisted a mind must become to feel okay about doing what that logger did. If you introspect deeply enough, you will discover that part of you would delight in shoving it deeper into Hell, where it "belongs" — and that this violent urge is every bit as malevolent as burning a girl alive. The evil in the logger's mind is spreading to yours — only it doesn't feel evil; it feels unmistakably **righteous**. Until you see how this seduction works, you will never understand the trick by which it has enslaved our world. You will only succeed in unwittingly spreading it. The world desperately needs our fierce, uncompromising Love; not our self-righteous contempt. They are **not** the same. One is the evil twin of the other._

We can't predict all the downstream effects of even our tiniest behaviors to know if they will be a "net good," but we _can_ know when we are being evil — and it happens far more often than we realize.

<p align="center" width="100%">
    <img width="300px" src="img/half-evil.png"> 
</p>

As much as we try to hide our underlying motivations — even from ourselves — other people are _exquisitely_ sensitive to them, if only subconsciously. Malice makes us look evil — _because it is_ — and it powerfully evokes _their_ malice in response.

They now feel every bit as justified in violently stopping us as we do them, because they can now plausibly claim to be _fighting evil_. Even if we manage to suppress their misbehavior (in public, anyway), the darkness has been embedded deeper into their mind — and it _will_ manifest in some way. From there, it will ripple out into the world, where we will be able to disavow any connection to it.

The world becomes darker as a result. But this isn't an unfortunate side effect of our well-intentioned behavior: it was secretly orchestrated by a sinister aspect within our minds. The way this works is _insanely_ clever.

<p align="center" width="100%">
    <img width="300px" src="img/evil-above-world.png"> 
</p>

People are only able to misbehave due to a kind of self-deception: part of them knows perfectly well that what they're doing is wrong, but that "wrongness" is cleverly hidden from conscious self-reflection. We all know this state perfectly well, if we're honest. Every one of us has skirted our conscience, either pretending that we couldn't hear it, or that it was safe to override it. Try to remember what that state is like.

In this state, wrong no longer feels _wrong_ — and it would take considerable skill for someone to call out our misbehavior without triggering our defense mechanisms and making a bigger mess. If they did it with a trace of cruelty, we would immediately identify them as someone without the moral authority to be judging us. We would see them as being blithely unaware of their own darkness, and in need of correction themselves. It would result in a mutual spiral into Hell.

Do they know that this will happen? Consciously, they do not. They imagine that their overwhelming _righteousness_ will cause us to repent. But at a deeper level, they know that this story is a sham. Part of them secretly wants to egg us on, so that their unflattering view of us will be vindicated — but they cannot admit this to themselves, any more than we can admit our own self-deception to ourselves in that moment.

The same is true when we use malice to correct "bad people." Part of us is trying to provoke them, but we convince ourselves that we're doing it for the greater good. If we could just see how this process of self-deception works in us, we would understand _exactly_ the mechanism that enables their misbehavior, which would enable to do something useful about it. Instead, we get sucked into the same old trap, triggering that downward spiral.

It's not merely _harming_ them that causes this spiral, but the malice with which we do it. It is entirely possible to harm people out of fierce compassion for the world, but it feels **nothing** like malice. The connection to your "heart" has not been severed. Others can sense the profoundly benevolent intent, and it prevents their evil from finding the "hook" it needs to justify itself. Instead, it is confronted with a blinding Light that will weaken it, if only imperceptibly. Indeed, it is the only thing that can.

<p align="center" width="100%">
    <img width="300px" src="img/devil-vs-devil.png"> 
</p>

If it is really this simple, then why haven't we (as a species) figured it out and changed our ways?

Part of us _knows_ that we're not intrinsically better than anyone — but given how low people can sink, this is painful to admit, so we hide it from ourselves. We use malice to keep people trapped in delusion, so that we can prove that our morally superiority. Unfortunately, shoving people into Hell is hardly "morally superior," so we must hide this intention from ourselves, too, by convincing ourselves that it is noble. This results in an ever-tightening noose of deception that collapses in on itself like a black hole, preventing us from ever suspecting what we're really doing.

(This is why it feels so damn delicious to watch revenge fantasy flicks like _The Equalizer_, or those "Karens Getting Owned" YouTube videos. They are playing to this delusion, pure and simple — and as a culture, we eat it up.)

    <em>Oh noes, even MOAR consequences!</em>
</p>

If we travel far enough down this dark path, we will eventually lose even the _pretense_ of being good. That's where the "evil people" find themselves trapped. We ourselves are profoundly susceptible to this slippery slope, whether we like to admit it or not — and the only way to protect against it is to recognize how it works. This is also the only way to free others, instead of mindlessly perpetuating the trap.

    <img width="300px" src="img/half-evil.png"> 
</p>

Other people are _exquisitely_ sensitive to our motivations, even if only subconsciously. They can detect our malicious intent, even when we (consciously) can't. It makes us look evil — because it _is_ — and this powerfully evokes _their_ malice in response.

They then feel justified in violently stopping us, because from their perspective they are legitimately _fighting evil_. Even if our cruelty manages to suppress their misbehavior (in public, anyway), the darkness has been embedded deeper into their mind — and it _will_ manifest in some way. From there, it will ripple out into the world, where we will be able to disavow any connection to it.

The world becomes darker as a result. But this isn't an unfortunate side effect of our well-intentioned behavior: it was secretly orchestrated by a sinister aspect within our minds. The way this works is _insanely_ clever.

<p align="center" width="100%">
    <img width="300px" src="img/evil-above-world.png"> 
</p>

People are only able to misbehave due to a kind of self-deception: part of them knows perfectly well when what they're doing is wrong, but that "wrongness" is cleverly hidden from conscious self-reflection. We believe that we can force them to acknowledge it, but this usually backfires: it makes them perceive _us_ as bad people, triggering a nasty response, which then forces us to escalate.

Part of us secretly knew this would happen. In fact, it _planned_ it. We wanted them to react poorly, so that we could prove to ourselves just how bad they are, thus licensing righteous escalation. Part of us knows perfectly well that we are doing this, but another part is carefully hiding that fact from ourselves. Sound familiar? We are caught in precisely the same self-deceptive trap that they are.

If we could just see how easily we deceive ourselves, we would understand the mechanism that enables _all_ misbehavior, which would empower to do something useful about it. Instead, we get sucked into the same trap that humanity has been for millennia.

It's not _harming_ them that is the problem, but the malice with which we do it. It is entirely possible to harm people out of fierce compassion for the world, but it feels **nothing** like malice. The crucial connection to our "heart" has not been severed. Others can sense the profoundly benevolent intent, and it prevents their evil from finding the "hook" it needs to reinforce itself. Instead, it is confronted with a blinding Light that will weaken it, if only imperceptibly — the _true_ "righteousness" that we falsely thought we were accessing through malice.

<p align="center" width="100%">
    <img width="300px" src="img/devil-vs-devil.png"> 
</p>

If it is really this simple, then why haven't we (as a species) figured it out and changed our ways?

Part of us _knows_ that we're not intrinsically better than anyone — but given how low people can sink, this is painful to admit, so we hide it from ourselves. We use malice to keep people trapped in delusion, so that we can prove our morally superiority. Unfortunately, shoving people into Hell is hardly "morally superior," so we must hide this intention from ourselves, too, by dressing it up as noble. This results in an ever-tightening noose of deception that collapses in on itself like a black hole, preventing us from ever suspecting what we're really doing.

In other words, we _need_ to see people as fundamentally bad, to remind ourselves that we are nothing like them. So we subconsciously behave in ways that "help" them stay bad. How? Not only by pushing them down, but by also trying to hide this behavior behind the guise of "good." That hypocrisy gives it the extra "oomph" it needs to really succeed.

(As an aside: revenge fantasy flicks like _The Equalizer_ and those "Karens Getting Owned" YouTube videos are playing to this delusion, pure and simple — and as a culture, we eat it up.)

    <em>Oh noes, even MOAR consequences!</em>
</p>

If we travel far enough down this dark path, we will eventually lose even the _pretense_ of being good. That's where the "evil people" find themselves trapped. We ourselves are profoundly susceptible to this slippery slope, whether we like to admit it or not — and the only way to protect against it is to recognize how it works. This is also the only way to free others, instead of mindlessly perpetuating the trap.

> _And no wonder, for even Satan masquerades as an angel of light._ —2 Corinthians 11:14

You know the classic image of the angel and devil sitting on our shoulders? It's _almost_ accurate, except for two things. First, the angel isn't really external to you, but represents your true nature as compassion. In a deep sense, it *is* you. The devil is external; a kind of parasite[^intrinsic]. But it doesn't just whisper obviously-bad ideas in your ear; it alters your very perception and pretends to be your inner angel.

<p align="center" width="100%">
    <img width="300px" src="img/parasite.png"> 
</p>

> _Be kind, for everyone you meet is fighting a great battle._ —Author unknown

Your angel already knows all this, and that even the most "evil" person is merely under the sway of a powerful parasite; one held in place by some "battle" invisible not only to you, but probably even to them. As hard as it may be to evict it, it's never _impossible._ But your devil makes it _appear_ impossible; as though their evil is intrinsic. This way, they seem _fundamentally defective_, and therefore worthy of malice.

Your devil knows that this dehumanization will appear evil to others — because it is the very _essence_ of evil — and so it knows that it will trigger the same reflex in them. It knows this because your devil and theirs are identical.

In fact, it turns out they're more than just identical: they're more like outgrowths of a single dark collective entity that is continually manipulating _all_ of our minds — the Devil, if you will.

<p align="center" width="100%">
    <img width="300px" src="img/shared-devil.png"> 
</p>

This is not just a religious invention: anyone who introspects carefully enough eventually perceives this "distributed malevolent entity" with a kind of intelligence and volition of its own that, even if not _literally_ true, explain its seemingly-coordinated behavior terrifyingly well. 

This "being" continually drives humanity toward various kinds of Armageddon: situations in which everyone is violently proving just how righteous they are. It is why the US is headed toward civil war without anyone recognizing their own complicity, and it explains bitter [divorces](https://www.gottman.com/blog/this-one-thing-is-the-biggest-predictor-of-divorce/) in which each side feels like the exclusive victim / hero. Nearly the whole world is caught in its terrible sway, evil provoking "righteous" retribution at every turn without anyone ever noticing the true source of it all.

It is that primordial "evil global conspiracy" to which all the rest ultimately owe their existence — and _we_ are its unwitting minions. Every attempt to maliciously subdue it "out there" just strengthens it, because such behavior is only ever initiated _by_ it — though it makes us believe that it was initiated by us.

**Any** time you feel malice, hatred, contempt, or even self-righteousness toward another being; any time you see them as fundamentally defective or inferior; any time you are tempted to divide the world into the (fundamentally) "good" and "bad," or to forsake anyone, you are feeding the Beast.

<p align="center" width="100%">
    <img width="300px" src="img/good-vs-bad.png"> 
</p>

To be clear: there are surely groups of particularly deluded people who conspire to cause great harm, but their existence wouldn't be possible if the rest of us weren't busy feeding the source — and conversely, it is _completely inevitable_ given that we are. **We must hold such people accountable**, but when we do this with contempt, we are reinforcing the very conditions that _compel_ their existence. If you could trace all the subtle threads of causality weaving through the world, you would find your finger in countless evil pies.

<p align="center" width="100%">
    <img width="300px" src="img/evil-conspiracy.png"> 
</p>

Our true enemy is not other people, but the dark "entity" that has captured _all_ of our minds. By keeping our attention fixated perpetually outward, it ensures that we never introspect deeply enough to notice our own role. This distraction is roughly what the Buddhists call the ego: the collection of habits we have developed to overlook our intimate interconnection with all of reality, so that we may elevate ourselves at its expense. It [pretends to _be_ you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gg8JYYyWSPg), but it is not your friend.

> *The shadow is a moral problem that challenges the whole ego-personality, for no one can become conscious of the shadow without considerable moral effort. To become conscious of it involves recognizing the dark aspects of the personality as present and real. This act is the essential condition for any kind of self-knowledge.* —Carl Jung

The only way out of this trap is to see beyond the ego, to your fundamentally compassionate nature. When you see this, you cannot help but see it in everyone else, too — because in an astonishing and heart-wrenching sense, [everyone **is** you](unity.md). This perception is not fully unveiled until enlightenment, but we can all taste it at all times. Ultimately, all self-deception boils down to willful ignorance of this fact — and all unkindness reinforces it. Why do I say "willful" ignorance? Because you eventually discover that _part of you has known this all along._ Think of this piece as a reminder.

From that clarity of perception, you cannot possibly harbor malice or contempt. You see it for the pure nonsense that it is. This enables you to perceive the hidden causes of people's self-deception, allowing you to do something real about it. That's what compassion (aka kindness) is.

To repeat: it doesn't mean being _nice_. It can outwardly be as fierce (or violent[^dalai-lama-gun], or even _apparently_ contemptuous) as the situation warrants, but these behaviors come from a completely different source, and have a completely different effect on all minds involved — again, rippling outward into the world in ways that we can't see or predict.

_This_ is why wise people urge compassion for evildoers: the only alternative is to join them in evil.

To be clear, compassion doesn't always know what the most beneficial behavior _is_; it merely ensures that you are not falling into the many seductive traps of your darkness. Determining the most effective behavior requires _wisdom_, which is a vast topic, and beyond the scope of this work. Compassion may be no easier to acquire than wisdom, but it is much simpler: there is a single place within your mind that you can turn to and _know._ So much trouble could be avoided if we just remembered to **look** — especially when we were most convinced that we didn't need to.

> *Such a man knows that whatever is wrong in the world is also in himself, and if he only learns to deal with his own shadow, he has done something real for the world. He has succeeded in shouldering at least an infinitesimal part of the gigantic, unsolved problems of our day.* —Carl Jung

    <img width="600px" src="img/buddha-and-demons.png"> 
</p>

Enlightenment may be a lofty goal to expect of humanity, but we can start small, by changing social norms. We can teach our children the difference between "kind" and "nice," and explain the sense in which kindness is _always_ the right motivation in all circumstances. We can refuse to join our allies when they're caught up in the traps of contempt[^contempt] and malice, and serve as an example of a better way.

## Footnotes

[^contempt]: Specifically, we mean (genuine) contempt for *people*. Contempt for ideas or behaviors can actually be healthy, as perhaps can (apparent) contempt that is rooted in genuine compassion.

[^intrinsic]: You may wonder how it is possible to know that evil is not intrinsic to other people's minds, but for our purposes it's more important to see that (1) our _perception_ of their intrinsic defectiveness is our own projection, and (2) our own darkness gives us the capacity to devolve into a condition in which others would be utterly convinced that _ours_ is intrinsic.

[^dalai-lama-gun]: The Dalai Lama was once asked what you should do if a gunman is trying to shoot you and you have a gun. [He said "shoot back."](https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/dalai-gun/)

> _For so long as the root of wickedness is hidden, it is strong. But when it is recognized, it is dissolved. When it is revealed, it perishes. ... It is powerful because we have not recognized it._ — The Gospel of Philip

Why is evil so hard to eradicate? What if the very strategy we've been using to fight evil is itself a fiendishly clever form of evil?

The more darkness we see in the world, the more we feel compelled to fight it with a little darkness of our own — except we don't think of ours as "darkness"; we think of it as "righteous."

This is the secret trick by which evil keeps itself alive — and nothing will change until we discover the astonishing truth: that part of us has been in on this trick all along...

---

Let's start by reflecting on [this horrifying story from 2012](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/southamerica/brazil/9005835/Loggers-burned-Amazon-tribe-girl-alive.html):

> _Loggers in Brazil captured an eight-year-old girl from one of the Amazon's last uncontacted tribes and burned her alive as part of a campaign to force the indigenous population from its land [...]_

<p align="center" width="100%">
    <img width="300px" src="img/tribe.png"> 
</p>

Can you feel the profound anger and heartbreak for the girl, her tribe, and humanity? It makes you want to do everything in your power to ensure this kind of thing never happens again — including punishing and maybe even harming the perpetrators if need be. At the same time, you may feel a desire to harm them quite _independently_ of any good it will bring: pure old-fashioned vengeance.

These two motivations — compassion and malice — arise from very different aspects of mind, but can be extremely difficult to tell apart. We usually dress up the latter to make it seem respectable; as though it is "for the greater good." We further confuse the issue by convincing ourselves that it doesn't matter which intention is driving our behavior; that only the result matters — as though our intentions are totally private and have no effect themselves.

This profound confusion is how evil sneaks into the world, undetected.

_Before I speak to your mind, let me speak to your heart. Imagine how dark and twisted a mind must become to feel okay about doing what that logger did. If you introspect deeply enough, you will discover that part of you is eager to shove it deeper into hell, where it "belongs" — and that this violent urge is every bit as malevolent as burning a girl alive._

_The evil in the logger's mind has spread to yours — only it doesn't feel evil; it feels impossibly **righteous**. Until you see clearly how this seduction works, you will never understand the trick by which evil has enslaved our world. You will only succeed in unwittingly spreading it._ 

_What the world desperately needs is our fierce, uncompromising Love; not our contempt[^contempt]. They are **not** the same. One is the evil twin of the other. Everything hinges on seeing this clearly._

We can't predict all the downstream effects of even our tiniest behaviors, but we _can_ know whether we are being totally honest about our intentions — and this matters far more than you know.

<p align="center" width="100%">
    <img width="300px" src="img/half-evil.png"> 
</p>

When we act maliciously, we secretly have a dual intent. On one hand, we are trying to appear righteous, as though we are fighting evil. On the other hand, part of us is trying to telegraph our own inner darkness to the evildoer — as if to show them that we are capable of everything that they are, and more.

We may not be conscious of this second communication, but our subconscious mind ensures that the message gets through — to our target, our allies, and bystanders alike. It may strike enough fear in our "victim" to pause their misbehavior (in public, anyway), but it also has a deeper effect: it assures them that _darkness is where the power is._ All who witness this behavior will therefore invite the darkness to further colonize their minds. It _will_ manifest in some form or another.

The world becomes darker as a result. We probably won't notice this, but even if we do, we will either blame it on them, or else write it off as "unfortunate" collateral damage. But it isn't actually an unfortunate side effect of our well-intentioned behavior: it was actually the _goal_, and was secretly orchestrated by a sinister aspect within our minds. The way this works is _insanely_ clever.

<p align="center" width="100%">
    <img width="300px" src="img/evil-above-world.png"> 
</p>

People are only able to misbehave due to a kind of self-deception: part of them knows perfectly well when what they're doing is wrong, but that "wrongness" is cleverly hidden from conscious self-reflection. We all know what this state is like: every one of us has skirted our conscience, pretending either that we couldn't hear it or that we could safely ignore it.

Try to recall what that state is like. In that bizarre schism of mind, you simultaneously _know_ and yet somehow _don't_. **This is the secret mechanism behind all the evil there ever was**.

We believe that we can violently force others to own up to their self-deception, but this usually backfires: they simply perceive _us_ as evil in return, and not having the moral authority to be judging anybody. Why on Earth would they feel compelled to repent or even introspect? No; they now feel compelled to violently force us to admit to _our_ evil.

Part of us secretly knew this would happen. In fact, it planned it. We _wanted_ them to react poorly, so that we could prove to ourselves just how bad they are, so that we could unleash more of our righteous fury. Think about it: isn't it much more viscerally satisfying to see bad people "get owned" than to have a change of heart, even if the latter is better for the world? We _want_ a fight.

We aren't telegraphing our darkness to _suppress_ theirs, but to _amplify_ it. If you introspect carefully enough, you can practically _feel_ the darkness in your mind reaching out to give theirs a secret handshake. Part of us knows perfectly well that we are doing this, but we carefully hide it from ourselves. Sound familiar? They weren't exactly _wrong_ to perceive us as "evil" — we are, indeed, caught in precisely the same trap that we are violently judging them for.

If we could just see how easily we deceive ourselves, we would understand the mechanism that enables _all_ misbehavior, and this would empower to do something useful about it. Instead, we continually get sucked into the same trap that humanity has been in for millennia.

It's not _harming_ them that was the problem (because harm is sometimes necessary), but the malice with which we did it. It is entirely possible to harm people out of fierce compassion, but it feels **nothing** like malice: the crucial connection to our Heart has not been severed. Others can sense our profoundly benevolent intent, and this prevents their evil from finding the "hook" that it uses to justify itself. Instead, it is confronted with a blinding Light that can only weaken it, if only imperceptibly — the _true_ "righteousness" that we thought we were accessing through malice.

<p align="center" width="100%">

This results in an ever-tightening noose of deception that collapses in on itself like a black hole, preventing us from ever suspecting what we're really doing. We are in too deep.

That's why revenge fantasy films like _The Equalizer_ are so popular: they exist only to keep us firmly ensconced in this warm delusion where we are the immaculate "good guys" fighting the hordes of pure evil "out there." Think of them as physical manifestations of our collective shadow.

## Footnotes

[^contempt]: Specifically, we mean (genuine) contempt for *people*. Contempt for ideas or behaviors can actually be healthy, as perhaps can (apparent) contempt that is rooted in genuine compassion.

[^intrinsic]: You may wonder how it is possible to know that evil is not intrinsic to other people's minds, but for our purposes it's more important to see that (1) our _perception_ of their intrinsic defectiveness is our own projection, and (2) our own darkness gives us the capacity to devolve into a condition in which others would be utterly convinced that _ours_ is intrinsic.

[^dalai-lama-gun]: The Dalai Lama was once asked what you should do if a gunman is trying to shoot you and you have a gun. [He said "shoot back."](https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/dalai-gun/)

The greatest trick the Devil ever pulled was to convince you that he doesn't exist _within your own mind_. The truth is that the more certain you are that you are immune to evil, the more surely you are already under its powerful grip without realizing it.

---

Take a moment to reflect on what's wrong with the world, and bring to mind the people responsible. Don't they seem _fundamentally morally defective_? Do you feel contempt or maybe even malice? It feels like those emotions are there to help you _fight_ evil, but they are actually manifestations _of_ evil. While feeling them, you can only darken the world, even as you are flawlessly convinced that you're helping.

This is not something I can convince you of, so I won't even try. But here's the thing: part of you already knows it. You don't enjoy mocking or shaming your enemies to help them (or anyone else) see the light, or to make the world a better place. You do it to make yourself feel superior. It may temporarily suppress their misbehavior, but it _will_ increase the net hostility and polarization in the world. You may tell yourself that it won't, or that it's their fault if it does, or that the benefits outweigh the drawbacks, but part of you knows that these are just lame excuses for malicious behavior. This is true of _all_ forms of unkindness. This example is just one among many.

This isn't an attack on you. But something within you is actively preventing you from consciously acknowledging the effects of your words and actions. Why? 

Part of you _knows_ that darkness exists within you, and it does everything in its power to shield this horrifying fact from your conscious mind. It makes you actively seek out the evil in others, because viciously attacking theirs takes attention off of your own. Said another way: something within us _needs_ other people to be "bad," so that we can know ourselves as "good" by comparison. So we subconsciously do things that _provoke_ evil in others, unbeknownst to our conscious minds.

</p>

Think back to a time when you disobeyed your conscience, pretending either that you couldn't hear it or that you could safely ignore it. When this happens, a schism is created in your mind: part of you knows _perfectly well_ that you're doing wrong, but that knowledge is cleverly hidden from conscious self-reflection. It is then easy to convince others that you _don't_ know, because you have convinced _yourself_. **All evil relies on this mechanism of self-deception**.

Evil (almost) never _feels_ evil. That's the most terrifying thing. One day you wake up and discover that nearly everything you've been doing to "fight evil" has only been amplifying it — and worse, that **part of you always knew this, even as you were doing it**. Until you see that this is going on within you (and clean it up), you have no hope of helping fix the evil "out there." You can only create more, while being supremely confident that you're helping.

The longer you let this condition fester, the more you must hide it from yourself, because the more you subconsciously recognize the horrifying (and increasing) similarity between what you're doing and what you're accusing others of doing: being cruel and pretending that it's okay. Very quickly you find yourself "in too deep" and completely unable to detect this, even when it is pointed out. In fact, when people _do_ point it out, your subconscious registers them as enemies, to "protect" you.

This is where the "bad people" find themselves. Something in them is shielding the _wrongness_ of their behavior from conscious self-reflection — and the more contemptuously you judge them for it, the more they will perceive _you_ as evil and dig in their heels. You will take this as confirmation of _their_ evil, but they are correctly recognizing the same self-deceptive mechanism in you that is operating within them. Part of you is baiting them into seeing you as evil, to justify your contempt — and this _is_ evil. This is how our darkness gets us to escalate violence while blaming it on others.

(The brilliance of this ruse is too amazing not to linger on for a moment. The only thing needed to create new evil is to _appear evil_, because this triggers malice in others. But go ahead and _try_ to appear evil. You can't do it, can you? You know that you're faking it. Now give someone a dehumanizing glare. Put as much contempt and malice into it as you can. There — that feels evil, doesn't it? They can feel it too. Now all that remains is to hide from yourself that you're trying to induce this feeling in others. _Voilà_. This is how we create evil while feeling righteous about it.)

The reason that the "bad people" need to shield their misbehavior is that _part of them doesn't want to be doing wrong._ This means that they are not _fundamentally_ defective. You don't have to take my word for it, but can actually learn to perceive this. If you manage to take your own self-deception mechanism offline, it feels exactly like you'd imagine feeling if you were suddenly freed from a demonic possession. When it lifts, you see that the darkness is not intrinsic to any mind, but has very cleverly commandeered them. We perceive it as intrinsic only to justify our contempt.

To be fair, there seems to be a tiny percentage of people who have invited the demon in, for whom the description "evil" really does capture something important. They pose a much greater challenge, because a large part of them _does_ want it. Being "kind" to them in the conventional sense can indeed be dangerous. And yet the very _deepest_ part of them does not want it. Again, once you see exactly what "it" is, you understand why _nobody_ ultimately could. Think of it as a form of Stockholm syndrome. If you really want to defeat evil, you must want them to be free of it, too.

When we meet (or even hear about) such people, we often experience the overwhelming urge to hate them, but this is the ultimate trap. What we're feeling is the urge to _shove them deeper into the abyss where they "belong."_ The more thoroughly the darkness has ensnared others, the more it behaves like a black hole, sucking away our own light. If we are not alert to this trap, we enter their dark space of mind, in which the deepest evil feels impossibly righteous. Don't fall for it.

How can you know if your self-deception mechanism has "gone offline"? You will clearly perceive your profound interconnectedness with the world. The "great battles" that others are facing will suddenly become obvious, as will your role in having exacerbated them. Malice, contempt [^contempt], and self-righteousness will be recognized as profoundly delusional. You will remember that you are not fundamentally better (or worse) than anyone, and that pretending you are just makes the world darker.

This perspective is not an altered state of mind, but something that is always there yet somehow curiously hidden. It is your deepest and most natural mode of knowing, which is how you will know that you can trust it.

The root of the problem was the desire to be special; what the Buddhists call the _ego_. For those of us with a self-image as "good people," this manifests as the need to be _relatively_ good; i.e., good in comparison to others. This duality forces us to continually create "bad people" in all sorts of subtle ways that we can't consciously recognize. This process only comes to an end when we discover the _absolute_ good within. This is something that we cannot take any credit for[^credit]. Instead, we can only feel profound gratitude for whatever grace allowed us to discover it, and heartbreak that it still remains so deeply hidden in others. The hardest part is watching the whole world being casually cruel to each other, not realizing which "team" they are secretly fighting for. It inspires a fierce determination to fight the "possession" that has captured people's minds, instead of deepening it like we've unwittingly been doing.

This doesn't mean that you will suddenly be nice or lovey-dovey toward evildoers. You may still need to be fierce, or perhaps even violent[^dalai-lama-gun]. Mockery, shaming, or even _apparent_ contempt might still be useful. But it will be in the service of _freeing_ people from the darkness, not pushing them further in. It is a kind of "tough love," and feels _nothing_ like the antagonism that you normally feel when "fighting evil." You are still "connected to your heart." **That is what is most crucial.** Others can sense the profoundly benevolent intent (even if only subconsciously), and it makes _all the difference in the world_.

To put it another way, in every interaction you have two options: to either encourage the Light in others, or to attack their darkness. Encouraging their Light isn't about being _nice_. It is about being completely unwilling to abandon yours under _any circumstances_ — including the one that their darkness is presently using to test you. It is looking for a "hook" in your mind that it can use to justify itself — some sign that even you, the "good person," are ultimately just faking it. If you are unwilling to abandon your integrity even then, the blinding brilliance of your Light _will_ tame their darkness at least a little. Or, said differently, it will remind their Light that it has a partner in the fight.

This is authentic kindness (aka compassion). It is "radical" in that it contradicts our usual intuition, that some people "deserve" our compassion and others don't. It could never be the case that some people deserve to be shoved further into the abyss while others deserve to be freed from it.

<p align="center" width="100%">
    <img width="300px" src="img/good-vs-bad.png"> 
</p>

I know it feels like some people don't _have_ an inner Light to encourage, but this is just an illusion that our darkness uses to get its foot in the door. Once it has tricked us into dividing the world into fundamentally good and bad people — which feels like the most natural thing in the world — it has gained nearly unfettered access to our minds. Then, it is only a matter of time until the right conditions manifest that license us to commit unspeakable horror in the name of "good."[^genocide]

> _And no wonder, for even Satan masquerades as an angel of light._ —2 Corinthians 11:14

You know the classic image of the angel and devil sitting on our shoulders? It's _almost_ accurate, except for two things. First, the angel isn't external to you, but represents your intrinsically compassionate nature. The devil _is_ extrinsic; it is a kind of parasite. But it doesn't just whisper obviously-bad ideas in your ear; it alters your very perception and pretends to _be_ your inner angel.

<p align="center" width="100%">
    <img width="300px" src="img/parasite.png"> 
</p>

It is this devil that tricks you into seeing other people as _fundamentally_ defective, instead of seeing that they are being manipulated by _their_ devils (which is something that your angel _can_ see). Our devils continually trigger each other — not because they are enemies, but _because they are allies_. This is how they strengthen each other. Evil never actually fights evil; it only pretends to, to create more of itself under the guise of good.

In this way, our devils behave more like a single "distributed organism" — the _Devil_, if you will — signaling to itself through the vast network of human minds. It leverages our collective intelligence to produce horrifying outcomes that none of us claim to want, yet which are the inevitable result of our cumulative self-deception.

<p align="center" width="100%">
    <img width="300px" src="img/shared-devil.png"> 
</p>

You know how it is said that "the elites" are tricking us into hating each other to take attention off of themselves? Doesn't this make you hate them? Could it be that there is something even more subtle and wicked that is tricking us into hating them, to keep our attention off of _it_? Indeed there is.

You know how people sometimes suspect that there's an "evil global conspiracy" lurking in the shadows, responsible for all the world's ills? They are not crazy. They are subconsciously sensing something genuine. There is an aspect of all of our minds communicating with itself beneath our conscious thresholds, shielding itself from discovery in _insanely_ clever ways. The closer we get to discovering it, the more it tricks us into projecting it "out there," so that we viciously attack others instead of defeating the one component of it that is within our own grasp. It stays alive because each one of us is valiantly _protecting_ our portion of it, believing that it's our friend.

<p align="center" width="100%">
    <img width="300px" src="img/evil-above-world.png"> 
</p>

This "dark entity" continually drives humanity toward various kinds of Armageddon: situations in which everyone gets to violently prove just how righteous they are. It is why the US is headed toward civil war without anyone recognizing their own complicity, and explains bitter [divorces](https://www.gottman.com/blog/this-one-thing-is-the-biggest-predictor-of-divorce/) in which each side feels like the exclusive victim / hero. Nearly the whole world is caught in its terrible sway, evil provoking "righteous" retribution at every turn, without anyone ever suspecting the true source of it all.

This is not just a wacky theory. As best I can tell, everyone who introspects carefully enough eventually discovers this. Something within your very mind is conspiring with the darkness in others to produce a kind of Hell on Earth. Every time you feel contempt for _anyone_, your devil is reaching out to give theirs a kind of secret handshake; a sinister agreement to keep this world bound in darkness. I have used the word "subconscious" to describe this activity, but that's not quite accurate. **It is completely accessible to consciousness, if you know how to look.** It is something you are _doing._ [The Devil hides in the very last place you would ever look](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gg8JYYyWSPg).

It is impossible to overstate the shock of discovering, for the first time, that you have _always_ been in on the "evil global conspiracy." It is terrifying, heartbreaking, and humbling all at once. Every single act of unkindness we've ever perpetrated has been in the service of the Beast, even when we told ourselves that it was noble. This includes not only being cruel to other people, but _all_ acts in which we skirt our conscience — such as when we "shave off a little extra" for ourselves at the expense of others, or take pleasure in others' suffering, or countless other "innocent" misbehaviors.

To be clear: there are surely groups of particularly "endarkened" people who conspire to cause great harm, but their existence wouldn't be possible if the rest of us weren't feeding the source — and conversely, it is _completely inevitable_ given that we are. **We must hold such people accountable** — but when we do it with contempt, we are reinforcing the very conditions that _compel_ their existence. They will continue to exist for as long as we each cherish the "right" to harbor a little darkness ourselves.

<p align="center" width="100%">
    <img width="300px" src="img/evil-conspiracy.png"> 
</p>

Ironically, we have no leg to stand on if we're still feeling self-righteous, because that is the surest sign that we are still under the demon's malevolent sway. This is precisely the opposite of what that emotion tells us — that the more we feel it, the more _free_ of evil we must surely be. It is actually impossible to fight evil from this place, because self-deception can only ever create more of itself.

Our true enemy is not other people, but the dark "entity" that has captured _all_ of our minds. By keeping our attention fixated perpetually outward, it ensures that we never introspect deeply enough to discover our own complicity in keeping it alive.

---

Perhaps MLK said it best:

> *Darkness cannot drive out darkness; only light can do that. Hate cannot drive out hate; only love can do that.*

Ultimately, evil is not actually a _presence_ (like it seems), but an _absence_. The absence of what? Of the perception of the profound interconnectedness of all Life; of our fundamental equality with others. Ultimately, all self-deception boils down to willful ignorance of this truth. It is simply not possible to reduce the darkness in the world by withholding our own Light; by leveraging our contempt, malice, hatred, etc. That is an insidious trap that we _must_ see through if humanity is to survive.

Your Light is capable of accomplishing everything you _think_ you need your darkness for, and much more — but there is a price that must be paid: you will have to give up the illusion of being special; one of the few "good people" fighting the hordes of evil. You must relinquish the sinister pleasure of watching your enemies "get owned." In short, you must give up self-deception.

In exchange, you will discover how to move toward the world you actually want in your deepest heart of hearts. It is well worth the price, and more.

What if nearly everything you're doing to "fight evil" is actually strengthening it — and moreover, what if part of you already knows this, but is actively concealing it from your conscious mind? What if the difficulty admitting this to yourself stems from the _very same mechanism_ that prevents the "bad people" from acknowledging the full implications of _their_ actions?

These are provocative questions, but they point to an astonishing truth — one that is excruciatingly painful yet ultimately liberating. The Devil hides in the very last place you would ever look.

---

Take a moment to reflect on what's wrong with the world, and bring to mind the people responsible. Don't they seem _fundamentally morally defective_? Do you feel contempt or maybe even malice? It feels like those emotions are there to help you _fight_ evil, but this is a sinister lie. They only to help you _darken_ the world while making you feel flawlessly convinced that you're helping.

This is not something I can convince you of, so I won't even try. But here's the thing: part of you already knows it. You don't enjoy mocking or shaming your enemies to help them (or anyone else) "see the light," or to make the world a better place. You do it to make yourself feel superior. It may temporarily suppress their misbehavior, but it _will_ increase the net hostility and polarization in the world. You may tell yourself that it won't, or that it's their fault if it does, or that the benefits outweigh the drawbacks, but part of you knows that these are just lame excuses for malicious behavior. This is true of _all_ forms of unkindness. This example is just one among countless.

This isn't an attack on you, though it may feel like one. That defensiveness is hiding something crucial — something that I promise you want to see. An aspect of your mind is actively preventing you from consciously acknowledging the effects of your words and actions. Why? 

Part of you _knows_ that darkness exists within you, and does everything in its power to shield this horrifying truth from your conscious mind. It makes you hyperfocus on the faults in others, because viciously attacking _their_ evil takes attention off of your own. Said another way: something within us _needs_ other people to be "bad," so that we can know ourselves as "good" by comparison. So we subconsciously do things to _provoke_ evil in others while convincing ourselves this is righteous.

Think back to a time when you disobeyed your conscience, pretending either that you couldn't hear it or that you could safely ignore it. We've all done this. When this happens, a schism is created in your mind: part of you knows _perfectly well_ that you're doing wrong, but that knowledge is cleverly shielded from conscious self-reflection. It is then easy to convince others that you _don't_ know, because you have convinced _yourself_. **All evil relies on this mechanism of self-deception**. We see it easily in others, but in ourselves only when it's convenient to our self-image.

Evil (almost) never _feels_ evil. That's the most terrifying thing. It's not until _after_ you wake up from this self-induced trance that you discover just how badly you were fooling yourself. People were even trying to _warn_ you, but in that grotesque state, you couldn't see what they were pointing at. In fact, the harder they tried to show you, the more you perceived _them_ as evil, crazy, or stupid — which only deepened your self-deceptive trance. But most horrifically of all, you see that some part of you always knew that you were doing wrong, even as you pretended not to.

This is where the "bad people" find themselves. Something in them is shielding the _wrongness_ of their behavior from conscious self-reflection — and the more contemptuously you judge them for it, the more they will perceive _you_ as evil and dig in their heels. You will take this as confirmation of _their_ evil, but they are actually recognizing the same self-deceptive mechanism in you that is operating within them – the very thing you see as "evil." **This whole sordid dance was choreographed by the darkness in _both_ of your minds, to perpetuate itself without either of you catching on.** You both come away feeling more than justified.

Something within you _wants_ to push people further into the dark, but doesn't want to be caught doing so. This is malevolent. People can subconsciously sense this intention, and this by itself is enough to provoke the darkness in their minds. Mission accomplished; more darkness was created without you having to do anything provably evil. All it took was your dark motivation — something that you can trivially deny, even to yourself. It is this dark pattern that "good people" employ to maintain their self-image. _Genuinely_ good people are those who have learned to stop doing it. They _never_ look down on others, because this is the surest sign of brewing self-deception.

The reason that the "bad people" need to shield their misbehavior from consciousness is that _part of them doesn't want to be doing wrong._ This means that they are not _fundamentally_ defective. We perceive their badness as intrinsic only to justify our contempt, which in turn exists only to create more. You don't have to take my word for it, but can actually learn to perceive this. If you manage to take your own self-deception mechanism offline for even a moment, it feels exactly like you'd imagine feeling if you were suddenly freed from a demonic possession. You clearly perceive how this "demon" has very cleverly commandeered people's minds.

To be fair, there does seem to be a tiny percentage of people who have consciously welcomed the demon in, for whom the description "evil" really does capture something important. Such people pose a unique challenge. Being "kind" to them in the conventional sense can indeed be dangerous. And yet the very _deepest_ aspect of their mind does not want it. Again, it is only once you see exactly what "it" is that you understand why _nobody_ ultimately could. Think of it like a form of Stockholm syndrome. If you want to defeat evil, you must want them to be free of it, too.

When we meet (or even hear about) such people, we often experience the overwhelming urge to hate them, but this is the ultimate trap. It is their darkness inviting ours to treat them in a way that will drive them further into its clutches — and we very often take the bait. How could we not? It is like a gift-wrapped present: the opportunity to manifest our darkest tendencies in a way that we can convince ourselves and others is unmistakably _good._ 

Seeing this all clearly turns your whole world upside-down. We are hating people for their susceptibility to the world's most fiendish mind-virus — the one responsible for our very hatred. **Any time you feel contempt for _anyone_ for _any reason whatsoever_, your mind is secretly gearing up to elevate or otherwise enrich yourself at the world's expense.** We are all hypocrites, and contempt is _always_ a sign that your mind is hiding some hypocrisy from yourself.

Until this becomes _common knowledge_ (in the [technical sense](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/common-knowledge/) — where everyone knows that everyone knows that everyone knows...), humanity will continue to tie itself up in horrifying knots while pretending to be freeing itself from them. (This is exemplified by "pseudo-kind" ideologies, in which people claim to be helping one person or group by demonizing another. This *always* triggers a counter-ideology, and not by accident.) Unfortunately, our self-deception prevents us from making this _common knowledge_, no matter how clearly it is pointed out. This piece is an attempt.

What happens when your self-deception mechanism to "goes offline"? 

Your whole carefully-constructed reality — and the hierarchy of blame that scaffolds it — suddenly comes crashing down. The "great battles" that others are facing suddenly become obvious, as does your unfortunate role in having perpetuated them. It is impossible to communicate how painful the full epiphany is — to see what a hypocrite you've been; to be forcefully shown just how much of the world's darkness can be traced back to your own decisions to be unkind. But it's not all gloom and doom.

You then perceive your profound interconnectedness with the world. Malice, contempt, and self-righteousness are recognized as profoundly delusional. Seeing how confused people actually are, it is impossible to feel a trace of ill-will. You remember the sense in which you are not fundamentally better (or worse) than anyone, and why pretending that you are always makes the world darker. You feel boundless love for all of reality, recognizing your inseparability from every particle of it.

This perspective is not an altered state of consciousness, but something that is always there yet somehow curiously hidden. It feels like coming home to a place you never left. It is your deepest and most natural mode of knowing, which is how you will know that you can trust it.

There, you see that the root of the problem was the desire to be special; what the Buddhists call the _ego_. For those of us with a self-image as "good people," this manifests as the need to be _relatively_ good; i.e., good in comparison to others. This duality forces us to continually create "bad people" in all sorts of subtle ways that we can't consciously recognize. This process only comes to an end when we discover the _absolute_ good within.

This "absolute good" is something that we cannot take any credit for[^credit]. Instead, we can only feel profound gratitude for whatever grace allowed us to discover it, and heartbreak that it still remains so deeply hidden in others. The hardest part is watching the whole world being casually cruel to each other, unaware of which "team" they are secretly fighting for. It inspires a fierce determination to end the "possession" that has captured people's minds, instead of deepening it like we've unwittingly been doing. We clearly see the face of our true nemesis for the first time.

This doesn't mean that you will suddenly become nice or lovey-dovey toward evildoers. You may still need to be fierce, or perhaps even violent[^dalai-lama-gun]. Mockery, shaming, or even _apparent_ contempt might still be useful tools in your arsenal. But these will be in the service of _freeing_ people from the darkness, not pushing them further in. It is a kind of "tough love," and feels _nothing_ like the self-righteous antagonism that we normally feel when "fighting evil." You are still "connected to your heart." **That is what is most crucial.** Others can sense the profoundly benevolent intent (even if only subconsciously), and it makes _all the difference in the world_.

In every interaction you have two options: to either encourage the Light in others, or to fight their darkness with yours. **Encouraging their Light has nothing to do with being _nice_**. It is about being completely unwilling to abandon your own Light under _any circumstances_ — including the one that their darkness is presently testing you with. Their darkness is looking for a "hook" in your mind that it can use to justify itself — some sign that even you, the "good person," are weak to its seduction. If you refuse to abandon your integrity even then, the fierceness of your Light subjugates their darkness. They subconsciously remember that _the Light_ isn't just a myth.

This is authentic kindness (aka compassion). It is "radical" for two reasons. First, it contradicts our usual intuition that some people "deserve" it while others don't. It could never be the case that some people deserve to be shoved further into the abyss while others deserve to be freed from it. Second, it need not look anything like "kindness" in the conventional sense (though most often, it will). It certainly doesn't have to be soft or weak.

I know it feels like some people don't _have_ an inner Light to encourage, but this is just an illusion that our darkness uses to get its foot in the door. By the time it has tricked us into dividing the world into fundamentally "good" and "bad" people — which feels like the most natural thing in the world — it has already infected the deepest aspect of our minds. Then, it can bide its time fostering conditions that will get us to commit unspeakable horror in the name of "good."[^genocide]

> _And no wonder, for even Satan masquerades as an angel of light._ —2 Corinthians 11:14

It is said that "the elites" are tricking us into hating each other to take attention off of themselves. Doesn't this make you hate them? Could it be that there is an even more subtle and wicked puppetmaster that is tricking us into hating _them_, so that we never discover _it_?

Indeed there is. No matter how much power the elites wield, it is _nothing_ compared to that of the dark entity pulling even their strings.

<p align="center" width="100%">

You know the classic image of the angel and devil sitting on our shoulders? It's _almost_ accurate, except for two things. First, the angel isn't external to you, but represents your intrinsically compassionate nature. Second, the devil _is_ extrinsic; it is a kind of parasite. But it doesn't just whisper obviously-bad ideas in your ear; it alters your very perception and pretends to _be_ your inner angel.

<p align="center" width="100%">
    <img width="300px" src="img/parasite.png"> 
</p>

It is this devil that tricks you into seeing other people as _fundamentally_ defective, instead of seeing that they are being manipulated by _their_ devils (which is something that your angel can always see). Our devils continually trigger each other — not because they are enemies, but _because they are allies_. Evil never actually fights evil; it only pretends to, to create more of itself.

You know how people sometimes suspect that there's an "evil global conspiracy" lurking in the shadows, running the show behind the scenes? They are not crazy. They are subconsciously sensing something genuine: there is indeed an aspect of all of our minds communicating with itself beneath our conscious thresholds, shielding itself from discovery in _insanely_ clever ways. Its greatest trick is to prevent us from suspecting, let alone detecting, our own role in keeping it alive.

Our individual devils are working together almost like a single "distributed organism" — the _Devil_, if you will. Each of us suspects its existence, but we all view it from different angles. No two people fully agree on who's ultimately pulling the strings of the evil plot. The truth is that _nobody_ is — and _everybody_ is.

<p align="center" width="100%">
    <img width="300px" src="img/evil-above-world.png"> 
</p>

This "dark entity" continually drives humanity toward various kinds of Armageddon: situations in which everyone is violently expressing their own righteous fury to defeat the darkness "out there." It is why the US is headed toward civil war without anyone suspecting their own complicity, and explains bitter [divorces](https://www.gottman.com/blog/this-one-thing-is-the-biggest-predictor-of-divorce/) in which each side feels like the exclusive victim / hero. Nearly the whole world is caught in its terrible sway, evil provoking "righteous" retribution at every turn, without anyone ever noticing the true source of it all.

This is not just a wacky theory, or just a metaphor. As best I can tell, everyone who introspects carefully enough eventually discovers this. Something within your very mind is conspiring with the darkness in others to produce a kind of Hell on Earth. Every time you feel contempt for _anyone_, your "devil" is reaching out to give theirs a kind of secret handshake; a sinister agreement to keep this world bound in darkness. I have used the word "subconscious" to describe this activity, but that's not quite accurate. **It is completely accessible to consciousness, if you know how to look.** It is something you are _doing._ [The Devil hides in the last place you would ever look](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gg8JYYyWSPg); the innermost chamber of your mind.

It is impossible to overstate the shock of discovering, for the first time, that you have _always_ been in on the "evil global conspiracy." It is terrifying, heartbreaking, and humbling all at once. Every single act of unkindness we've ever perpetrated has been in the service of the Beast, even when we told ourselves that we had "good intentions." This includes not only being cruel to other people, but _all_ acts in which we skirt our conscience — such as when we "shave off a little extra" for ourselves at the expense of others, or take pleasure in others' suffering, or countless other "innocent" misbehaviors. Every time we do this, we are strengthening each other's demons.

To be clear: there are surely groups of particularly "endarkened" people who consciously conspire to cause great harm, and **we must hold such people accountable** — but when we do so with contempt, we are secretly (and on a subconscious level, _knowingly_) reinforcing the very conditions that effectively compel their existence. They cannot be defeated without our seeing this.

<p align="center" width="100%">
    <img width="300px" src="img/evil-conspiracy.png"> 
</p>

Ironically, we have no leg to stand on if we're still feeling self-righteous, because that is the surest sign that we are still under the demon's malevolent sway. This is precisely the opposite of what that emotion tells us — that the more we feel it, the more _free_ of evil we must surely be. It is actually impossible to fight evil from this place, because self-deception can only ever create more of itself.

Our true enemy is not other people, but the dark "entity" that has captured _all_ of our minds. By keeping our attention fixated perpetually outward, it ensures that we never introspect deeply enough to discover our own complicity in keeping it alive. We _must_ learn to perceive this.

We each have a crucial role to play in bringing down the "global conspiracy," and it begins by rediscovering our Light.

MLK once said:

> *Darkness cannot drive out darkness; only light can do that. Hate cannot drive out hate; only love can do that.*

These words are far wiser than we know. Ultimately, evil is not actually a _presence_ (like it seems), but an _absence_. The absence of what? Of the perception of the interconnectedness of all Life; of our fundamental equality with others. That this absence can behave so much like a presence — and an _intelligent_ one at that — is astonishing.

In a profound and surprising sense, [you _are_ the world](unity.md). Ultimately, all self-deception boils down to ignorance of this fact. This ignorance is not fully dispelled until _enlightenment_, but we can all sense it at all times. It is why certain literature speaks to us so loudly, and why we sometimes thank strangers for acts of charity that don't seem to benefit us directly. Part of us knows that what happens to the world ultimately happens to us. It is senseless to scorn people for not having realized this.

It is not possible to reduce the darkness in the world by withholding our own Light; by leveraging our contempt[^contempt], malice, hatred, etc. That is an insidious trap that we _must_ see through if humanity is to survive. Your Light is capable of accomplishing everything you think you need your darkness for, and much, much more — but there is a price that must be paid: you must give up the illusion of being special; of being fundamentally different from the "bad people." You must relinquish the sinister pleasure of watching harm come to your enemies. In brief, you must give up self-deception.

In exchange, you will discover the path toward the world you actually want in your deepest heart of hearts. It is well worth the price, and infinitely more.

> *Nail on the head brother. My most recent mushroom trip (also the largest dose I've ever taken) I became fixated on a news story I had heard that week. About an 8 year old girl from a tribe in the Amazon, who was tied to a tree and burned alive in order to scare her people off their land so it could be logged. I realized that at the moment he did it, whoever lit that gasoline actually felt / thought more or less okay about what he was doing. **And my mind was illuminated with dozens of the parallels between that man's malformed, horrific perceptual / behavioral state, and mine.

## Footnotes

[^contempt]: Specifically, we mean (genuine) contempt for *people*. Contempt for ideas or behaviors can actually be healthy, as perhaps can (apparent) contempt that is rooted in genuine compassion.

[^credit]: In fact, taking credit for it is one way to be sure that we haven't found "it."

[^dalai-lama-gun]: The Dalai Lama was once asked what you should do if a gunman is trying to shoot you and you have a gun. [He said "shoot back."](https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/dalai-gun/)

[^genocide]: This is how genocides happen. The Nazis referred to Jews as 'vermin,' and during the genocide in Rwanda, Tutsis were referred to as 'cockroaches.' This is a common pattern throughout history. Perhaps paradoxically, the only way to be sure that you'd never do such a thing is that you don't feel contempt for the people who have.
