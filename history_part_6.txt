What if nearly everything you're doing to "fight evil" is secretly strengthening it — and moreover, what if part of you already knows this, but is actively concealing it from your conscious mind?

---

Take a moment to reflect on what's wrong with the world, and bring to mind the people responsible. Don't they seem not only morally defective, but somehow _fundamentally_ so? Such people cannot be helped; they can only be subdued or punished. Treating them with contempt is therefore not only acceptable but positively _righteous_.

This is an illusion. People are only able to misbehave due to a kind of self-deception: part of them knows perfectly well that they are doing wrong, but that knowledge is very cleverly shielded from conscious self-reflection. The more powerful this shielding, the more "evil" the person appears. In fact, this is the very mechanism that has enabled _all the evil there ever was_ — and it is what has enabled our own misbehavior too, if we're honest. We have all skirted our conscience before, pretending either that we couldn't hear it or that we didn't have to. Ours may differ in degree, but not in kind.

We don't mock and shame our political enemies to help them (or anyone else) "see the light," or to make the world a better place. We do it to feel superior while _telling_ ourselves that we're helping. We don't get to see all the downstream effects — a humiliated (and perhaps already-overworked) father taking his embarrassment out on his children, who then grow up to become "bad people" themselves. And even if by some miracle we do, we avoid acknowledging our own complicity. Sure, we may have provoked him, but he could have used it as an opportunity to become _better_. The fact that he didn't just proves that he's _bad_. Of course, there may also be some positive effects, such as temporarily suppressing his misbehavior (in public, anyway). But while it's impossible to prove whether the net result is good or bad, there is something that we _can_ know.

If you look carefully enough into your mind while feeling contempt — and this is _hard_ — you'll discover that it is secretly designed to darken the world. We _want_ our enemies to dig in their heels, because it vindicates our perception of them. If we can confirm that they are as bad as we feared, then we will eventually be justified in unleashing the full extent of our righteous fury — and there is nothing more primally satisfying than violently destroying evil. So we behave in ways that very cleverly trigger their defense mechanisms; to *strengthen* their capacity for self-deception. It is as though we are trying to draw out the evil that we _know_ is there, but in actuality we are creating more. You have **no idea** how good you are at creating and maintaining enemies to support your worldview. That's because the part of you that does this hides itself from your consciousness just as cleverly as "bad people's" misbehavior is hidden from them. It is completely accessible to consciousness, if you look. But somehow, we never look.

<p align="center" width="100%"><img width="300px" src="img/half-evil.png"></p>

This is **profound** self-deception. As such, you are unlikely to believe me when I tell you that this is what is really happening, unless you've already seen it clearly operating in yourself. Our seemingly-innocent perception of people as _fundamentally defective_ is a very clever ploy. It doesn't stay restricted to our minds. We use all of our capacities to _enforce_ it onto reality. Whatever little potential people may have to become free of their darkness, we violently squeeze out of them with our firm conviction that they have no such potential. We don't even have to be in direct contact with them to have this effect: one way or another, our darkness _always_ finds a way to leak into the world, slowly massaging it into the shape we need for everything to make sense to us. And this isn't just a wild hypothesis: you can learn to see it for yourself.

It is a profoundly humbling realization when you first discover it. How did we ever expect the "bad people" to confront their self-deception when we — the "good people" — couldn't detect our own? We are left with no leg to stand on. It is only once you see this clearly that you begin to appreciate the magnitude of what the "bad people" are up against — and that you learn to be of genuine service in fighting it.

> _Why do you look at the speck of sawdust in your brother’s eye and pay no attention to the plank in your own eye? How can you say to your brother, ‘Let me take the speck out of your eye,’ when all the time there is a plank in your own eye?

Self-deception is caused by a kind of parasite in the mind whose job is to make us feel different and special. It alters our very perception of reality, making us behave in ways that bolster our self-image.

<p align="center" width="100%"><img width="300px" src="img/parasite.png"></p>

For some people this may be about accumulating wealth or having the "right" skin color, while in others it is simply about being a "good person." That last one may seem noble, but it creates a perverse incentive: the only way to be "good" in the relative sense is for "bad" people to exist. The worse other people become, the better we look by comparison. Thus, our subconscious is on the prowl for people it can make worse. But of course, being "good people," we can't do this to just anyone. So our parasite makes certain people appear _fundamentally defective_, so that harming them suddenly becomes noble. Everyone else must be treated with "compassion," and we make a big show of being their saviors.

<p align="center" width="100%"><img width="300px" src="img/good-vs-bad.png"></p>

This works, for a while. The problem is that the more we do this, the more we begin to suspect a disturbing truth: such behavior isn't evidence of how _different_ we are from the "bad people," but how _similar_ we are. We have two options at this point: to admit and renounce the sordid  game we've been playing, or to double down. For the most part, we choose the latter. We drive this knowledge ever-further out of consciousness, securely locking it away under lock and key. But we cannot outrun it forever.

Sooner or later, the funhouse of mirrors comes crashing down, and we are forced to confront what profound hypocrites we've been. This discovery hurts like Hell — but it also triggers the deepest introspection of our lives. We discover that we never wanted to do this. We never wanted to hurt anyone, and ultimately never _could_ want such a thing — because what we are in our innermost selves is _pure, unadulterated Goodness._ This is a very difficult thing to describe without sounding "woo," but there's no other way to put it without losing its enormity.

The deepest aspect of your mind is pure compassion; Light beyond measure. Its only job is to dispel the darkness in the world. As astonishing as this realization is, what's even more remarkable is that when you see it in yourself, you simultaneously see it in everybody else, too. That's because, in a profound and surprising sense, [you _are_ everybody and everything else](unity.md). In a flash, you discover the full extent of the horrifying confusion that binds humanity. You somehow perceive all the great battles that have led to the creation of "evil people." By forsaking them, you are only forsaking Yourself. Such behavior is itself "evil," but you only did it because you weren't ready to come Home yet. Everyone else was similarly lost, and in their deep confusion tried to prevent you from coming Home too. That's all "evil" ultimately _is_ — an innocent mistake that has grown to truly epic proportions.

I know this story may be hard to swallow, but I promise that it's something you can discover for yourself. Indeed, the deepest part of you already knows it.

By discovering your _absolute_ goodness, you begin to relinquish your need for _relative_ goodness. This undoes the illusion that motivates contempt. You slowly lose the dark urge to push people further into the abyss. Instead, you start to discover a better way. But before we explore that way, let's look at this whole thing from another angle.

---

<p align="center" width="100%"><img width="300px" src="img/devil-vs-devil.png"></p>

When you treat a "bad person" with contempt, you are secretly indicating to their parasite that you are similarly infected. It is a kind of secret handshake — one that their parasite readily accepts. Both you and your enemy will behave in ways that provide the _other_ person's parasite with exactly the excuses it needs to embed itself deeper into its host. In this way, _all_ of our parasites are intimately connected. In fact, they aren't truly separate. If you look closely enough, you'll discover that they behave more like a single distributed malevolent entity, communicating with itself beneath our conscious thresholds. If our parasites are that little devil on our shoulders, then this "entity" is the _Devil._

It continually drives humanity toward various kinds of Armageddon: situations in which everyone is violently proving how _righteous_ they are. It is why the US is headed toward civil war without anyone suspecting their own complicity, and explains bitter [divorces](https://www.gottman.com/blog/this-one-thing-is-the-biggest-predictor-of-divorce/) in which each side feels like the exclusive victim / hero. Nearly the whole world is caught in its terrible sway, evil provoking "righteous" retribution at every turn, without anyone ever noticing the true source of it all.

<p align="center" width="100%"><img width="300px" src="img/shared-devil.png"></p>

You know that "evil global conspiracy" that some people fear exists — the one that's somehow responsible for all the world's ills, yet which hides itself so perfectly that people never even suspect its existence? Well, _this is it_ — the _primordial_ evil conspiracy; the one to which all the rest ultimately owe their existence, and to which they all filter up. The reason we can't pin it down "out there" is because it lives deep within the shadows of all of our own minds. From in there, it knows _exactly_ what buttons to press to prevent us from ever suspecting our own involvement.

It may well be true that "the elites" are playing regular people off each other to take attention away from them, but the Devil is playing a _much_ larger game; one in which the elites are merely pawns. It's not that they mustn't be stopped — it's that the contempt with which we do so reinforces the very conditions that effectively compel their existence in the first place. The details of who is in power may change, but their underlying essence does not — and _cannot_ for as long as we're unaware of our own complicity. Every single act of unkindness that we perpetrate ripples out into the world, influencing faraway events, so that we never notice our connection to them.

<p align="center" width="100%"><img width="300px" src="img/evil-conspiracy.png"></p>

To be clear: there are certainly people who are knowingly and intentionally causing mayhem, and for whom the label "evil" may indeed serve a useful purpose. But if you still perceive this evil as _intrinsic_ to their minds, it only means that your own parasite is still operating, cleverly tempting you. People who are free of their parasites simply do not perceive reality this way. They cannot feel even the slightest trace of malice, contempt, or self-righteousness toward _anyone_. That's because they are able to perceive the part of people that genuinely wants to be _free_ of their parasite. This enables them to act with compassion — the "better way" that we hinted at before.

---

Compassion (aka kindness) does not mean being nice, or sweet, or forgiving, or even understanding. It is simply the absence of self-deception. It can be as fierce (or potentially even violent) as the situation warrants. But it never falls into the illusion of being fundamentally better than anyone, and this makes all the difference.

Again, when you show contempt — for the _person_, not just their ideas or behavior — you are putting your own self-deception on clear display. The deepest part of you knows that you're not ultimately better than anyone (like you are currently pretending to be). And the deepest part of _them_ can see this, even if only subconsciously. They can sense that you are a hypocrite, and this enables them to ignore any genuinely righteous content in your message. Even worse, it teaches them that there _are_ no genuinely decent people; that even the "good people" are just faking it. Any "inner Light" thus becomes even more of a naive myth.

When self-deception is absent, the opposite occurs. Their parasite is confronted with the one thing it cannot stand: authentic Goodness. It is robbed of its power to justify its own existence, because it is in the presence of something immeasurably greater and truer. This is _very_ difficult to describe, but I know you've felt it before. Everything comes down to standing firmly in your inner Light, _especially_ when confronted with the greatest depths of Darkness, when you are most tempted to abandon it. It may not eliminate evil as quickly as you'd like, or be as deliciously satisfying as giving in to self-righteousness, but it is the _only_ way toward the world your heart most deeply desires.

Ultimately, the Darkness is not an entity in its own right, but merely the absence of Light. The fact that it can _behave_ like such an entity — the Devil — is truly one of the most astonishing facts of existence. This is why, as MLK Jr said:

> *Darkness cannot drive out darkness, only light can do that. Hate cannot drive out hate, only love can do that.* ― Martin Luther King, Jr.

His words stand true as ever.

---

Your real enemy is not actually other people, but the remarkable self-deception that has overtaken our minds. Its horsemen are malice, contempt, and self-righteousness. May we uproot these dark tendencies in ourselves so that we may join the fight against it — the only fight that ultimately matters.

What if nearly everything you're doing to "fight evil" is secretly strengthening it — and moreover, what if part of you already knows this, but is actively concealing it from your conscious mind?

Take a moment to reflect on what's wrong with the world, and bring to mind the people responsible — the greedy bankers; the hypocritical CEOs; the corrupt politicians (and all who support them). Don't they seem not only morally defective, but somehow _fundamentally_ so? Such people cannot be helped; they can only be subdued or punished. Treating them with contempt is therefore not only acceptable but positively righteous.

This is an illusion.

We have all skirted our conscience before, pretending either that we couldn't hear it or that we didn't have to. Our own instances may differ in degree, but not in kind.

When we encounter others in this state, we feel compelled to rub their noses in it. By forcing them to confront just how _bad_ they are, we expect that they will stop — and when they don't, we feel that we have no choice but to escalate. What we can't see is that this itself is profound self-deception — and self-deception is a group phenomenon. By trying to convince people that they are _fundamentally defective_, we are triggering their defense mechanisms — and we _know_ what the result will be.

We don't mock and shame our political enemies to help them (or anyone else) "see the light," or to make the world a better place. We do it to feel superior while _telling_ ourselves that we're helping. We don't get to see all the downstream effects — a humiliated (and perhaps overworked) father taking his embarrassment out on his children, who then grow up to become "bad people" themselves. And even if by some miracle we do, we avoid acknowledging our own complicity. Sure, we may have provoked him, but why didn't he use it as an opportunity to become _better_? This just proves that he's _bad_. Of course, there may also be some positive effects, such as temporarily suppressing his misbehavior (in public, anyway). But while it's hard to know whether the net result is good or bad (think _butterfly effect_), there is something that we _can_ know.

If you look carefully enough into your mind while feeling contempt — and this is hard — you'll discover that it is secretly _designed_ to darken the world. We _want_ our enemies to dig in their heels, because it vindicates our perception of them. If we can confirm that they are as bad as we feared, then we will eventually be justified in unleashing the full extent of our righteous fury — and there is nothing more primally satisfying than violently destroying evil.

It is as though we are trying to draw out the evil that we "know" is already in there, but in actuality we are creating more.

You have **no idea** how good you are at creating and maintaining enemies to justify and reinforce your view of the world; your infallible inner story of "good guys" and "bad guys." That's because the part of you that does this hides itself from your consciousness just as cleverly as "bad people's" misbehavior is hidden from them. It is completely accessible to consciousness, if you look. But somehow, we never look. Something within us knows that if we were forced to confront our own self-deception, our whole perception of the world — and the stories of blame that scaffold it — would suddenly come crashing down.

<p align="center" width="100%"><img width="300px" src="img/half-evil.png"></p>

It is **profound** self-deception. As such, you are unlikely to believe me when I tell you that this is what is really happening, unless you've already seen it clearly operating in yourself. Our seemingly-innocent perception of people as _fundamentally defective_ is not so innocent. It does not stay confined to our own minds: we use all of our capacities to _enforce_ it onto reality.

Self-deception is caused by a kind of parasite in the mind. Think of it as that little devil on your shoulder. But unlike in the cartoons, this devil doesn't just whisper obviously-bad ideas in your ear; no, it alters your very perception at such a fundamental level that you don't even realize you're being seduced. You just see it as "reality."

<p align="center" width="100%"><img width="300px" src="img/parasite.png"></p>

The key point is that it is a _parasite._ Unlike your angel — which is intrinsic to your mind, and represents your fundamental goodness — your devil can be evicted, bit by bit. But every time you listen to it — that is, every time you give in to your self-deception — it burrows a little bit deeper into your mind, feeling more and more like "you" with each step. The more this happens, the more you appear "evil" to others.

People don't listen to it because they're _bad_ — even though it (very convincingly) appears that way. Instead, the confluence of experiences they've had — which you can think of as having accumulated over lifetimes, or perhaps in what we now think of as their epigenome — somehow makes them feel like listening to it is the "right" thing to do. They have been very cleverly lulled to sleep.

The point is not to feel sorry for evil people, but to gain insight into the bizarre mechanism that has overtaken their minds. The most important thing to see here is that the very same mechanism exists in yours. It is _your_ parasite that makes you see them (or anyone else) as _fundamentally defective_; to see their evil as somehow intrinsic to their minds.

It is well known that even Hitler thought that he was doing something noble. I'll refrain from quoting him directly[^Hitler], but he genuinely believed that he was saving the world from the Devil, which had somehow manifested into the world as the Jewish people. It is easy for us to recognize this as profound delusion, but it is much harder to see that the vile misperception that affected him is _precisely_ the same one that makes us perceive him as "intrinsically" evil; something that we ourselves could never ever be.

This is a subtle point, so I don't want it to be misunderstood. He was surely deluded enough to deserve the label "evil," and being kind to him in the conventional sense would have been dangerously stupid. But the belief that he (and the Nazi army) were somehow _fundamentally_ different from us is a dark lie that our parasite uses to invite itself deeper into our minds, bit by bit. Its whole trick is to make you believe that you are special and immune; that only _other_ people are susceptible. This is how you learn to overlook your own misbehavior, quickly becoming convinced that you either don't have any, or that yours isn't causing much harm to the world.

---

Our parasite leverages our primal need to see ourselves as "good people" to cause mayhem. This instinct may seem noble, but it creates a perverse incentive: the only way to be "good" in the relative sense is for "bad" people to exist. The worse other people become, the better we look by comparison. Thus, our subconscious is on the prowl for people it can _make_ worse. But of course, being "good people," we can't do this to just anyone. So our parasite makes us see some people as _fundamentally defective_, so that harming them suddenly becomes noble. Everyone else must be treated with "compassion," and we make a big show of being their saviors.

<p align="center" width="100%"><img width="300px" src="img/good-vs-bad.png"></p>

This works — for a while. The problem is that the more we do this, the more we begin to suspect a disturbing truth: such behavior isn't evidence of how _different_ we are from the "bad people," but how _similar_ we are. We have two options at this point: to admit and renounce the sordid  game we've been playing, or to double down. For the most part, we choose the latter. We drive this knowledge ever-further out of consciousness, securely locking it away under lock and key. But we cannot outrun it forever.

Sooner or later, the funhouse of mirrors comes crashing down, and we are forced to confront what profound hypocrites we've been. This discovery hurts like Hell — but it also triggers the deepest introspection of our lives. We discover that we never wanted to do this. We never wanted to hurt anyone, and ultimately never _could_ want such a thing — because what we are in our innermost selves is _pure, unadulterated Goodness._ This is a very difficult thing to describe without sounding "woo," but there's no other way to put it without losing its enormity.

The deepest aspect of your mind is pure compassion; Light beyond measure. Its only job is to dispel the darkness in the world. As astonishing as this realization is, what's even more remarkable is that when you see it in yourself, you simultaneously see it in everybody else, too. That's because, in a profound and surprising sense, [you _are_ everybody and everything else](unity.md). In a flash, you discover the full extent of the horrifying confusion that binds humanity. You somehow perceive all the great battles that have led to the creation of "evil people." By forsaking them, you are only forsaking Yourself. Such behavior is itself "evil," but you only did it because you weren't ready to come Home yet. Everyone else was similarly lost, and in their deep confusion tried to prevent you from coming Home too. That's all "evil" ultimately _is_ — an innocent mistake that has grown to truly epic proportions.

I know this story may be hard to swallow, but I promise that it's something you can discover for yourself. Indeed, the deepest part of you already knows it.

By discovering your _absolute_ goodness, you begin to relinquish your need for _relative_ goodness. This undoes the illusion that motivates contempt. You slowly lose the dark urge to push people further into the abyss. Instead, you start to discover a better way. But before we explore that way, let's look at this whole thing from another angle.

<p align="center" width="100%"><img width="300px" src="img/devil-vs-devil.png"></p>

When you treat a "bad person" with contempt, you are secretly indicating to their parasite that you are similarly infected. It is a kind of secret handshake — one that their parasite readily accepts. Both you and your enemy will behave in ways that provide the _other_ person's parasite with exactly the excuses it needs to embed itself deeper into its host. In this way, _all_ of our parasites are intimately connected. In fact, they aren't truly separate. If you look closely enough, you'll discover that they behave more like a single distributed malevolent entity, communicating with itself beneath our conscious thresholds. If our parasites are that little devil on our shoulders, then this "entity" is the _Devil._

It continually drives humanity toward various kinds of Armageddon: situations in which everyone is violently proving how _righteous_ they are. It is why the US is headed toward civil war without anyone suspecting their own complicity, and explains bitter [divorces](https://www.gottman.com/blog/this-one-thing-is-the-biggest-predictor-of-divorce/) in which each side feels like the exclusive victim / hero. Nearly the whole world is caught in its terrible sway, evil provoking "righteous" retribution at every turn, without anyone ever noticing the true source of it all.

<p align="center" width="100%"><img width="300px" src="img/shared-devil.png"></p>

You know that "evil global conspiracy" that some people fear exists — the one that's somehow responsible for all the world's ills, yet which hides itself so perfectly that people never even suspect its existence? Well, _this is it_ — the _primordial_ evil conspiracy; the one to which all the rest ultimately owe their existence, and to which they all filter up. The reason we can't pin it down "out there" is because it lives deep within the shadows of all of our own minds. From in there, it knows _exactly_ what buttons to press to prevent us from ever suspecting our own involvement.

It may well be true that "the elites" are playing regular people off each other to take attention away from them, but the Devil is playing a _much_ larger game; one in which the elites are merely pawns. It's not that they mustn't be stopped — it's that the contempt with which we do so reinforces the very conditions that effectively compel their existence in the first place. The details of who is in power may change, but their underlying essence does not — and _cannot_ for as long as we're unaware of our own complicity. Every single act of unkindness that we perpetrate ripples out into the world, influencing faraway events, so that we never notice our connection to them.

<p align="center" width="100%"><img width="300px" src="img/evil-conspiracy.png"></p>

To be clear: there are certainly people who are knowingly and intentionally causing mayhem, and for whom the label "evil" may indeed serve a useful purpose. But if you still perceive this evil as _intrinsic_ to their minds, it only means that your own parasite is still operating, cleverly tempting you. People who are free of their parasites simply do not perceive reality this way. They cannot feel even the slightest trace of malice, contempt, or self-righteousness toward _anyone_. That's because they are able to perceive the part of people that genuinely wants to be _free_ of their parasite. This enables them to act with compassion — the "better way" that we hinted at before.

---

Compassion (aka kindness) does not mean being nice, or sweet, or forgiving, or even understanding. It is simply the absence of self-deception. It can be as fierce (or potentially even violent) as the situation warrants. But it never falls into the illusion of being fundamentally better than anyone, and this makes all the difference.

Again, when you show contempt — for the _person_, not just their ideas or behavior — you are putting your own self-deception on clear display. The deepest part of you knows that you're not ultimately better than anyone (like you are currently pretending to be). And the deepest part of _them_ can see this, even if only subconsciously. They can sense that you are a hypocrite, and this enables them to ignore any genuinely righteous content in your message. Even worse, it teaches them that there _are_ no genuinely decent people; that even the "good people" are just faking it. Any "inner Light" thus becomes even more of a naive myth.

When self-deception is absent, the opposite occurs. Their parasite is confronted with the one thing it cannot stand: authentic Goodness. It is robbed of its power to justify its own existence, because it is in the presence of something immeasurably greater and truer. This is _very_ difficult to describe, but I know you've felt it before. Everything comes down to standing firmly in your inner Light, _especially_ when confronted with the greatest depths of Darkness, when you are most tempted to abandon it. It may not eliminate evil as quickly as you'd like, or be as deliciously satisfying as giving in to self-righteousness, but it is the _only_ way toward the world your heart most deeply desires.

Ultimately, the Darkness is not an entity in its own right, but merely the absence of Light. The fact that it can _behave_ like such an entity — the Devil — is truly one of the most astonishing facts of existence. This is why, as MLK Jr said:

> *Darkness cannot drive out darkness, only light can do that. Hate cannot drive out hate, only love can do that.* ― Martin Luther King, Jr.

His words stand true as ever.

Your real enemy is not actually other people, but the remarkable self-deception that has overtaken our minds. Its horsemen are malice, contempt, and self-righteousness. May we uproot these dark tendencies in ourselves so that we may join the fight against it — the only fight that ultimately matters.

================================

Why are we unkind to people who we perceive as "bad"? The answer seems obvious: we do it to make the world a better place. But this is an insidious lie. It explains why we're not _nice_, but not why we're not _kind_. Nice is about being pleasant and agreeable, which are clearly unhelpful in some situations. But kindness means something much deeper. It is the right motivation in _every_ circumstance.

---

A healthy mind harbors no hostility under any circumstances. That's not because it is meek or even "tolerant" per se. It can be fierce or even violent in subduing evil. These can be forms of kindness too. But it cannot feel even a _trace_ of malice, contempt, or self-righteousness, because it has seen something clearly.

It has seen that those sentiments are lies: they exist *only* to help us get away with something that we otherwise could not. We want to behave in some way that is self-serving, which we couldn't do if we could see the full humanity of the person we are attacking. So a dark aspect of our mind tricks us into perceiving them as somehow _fundamentally defective_. That way, we won't feel bad harming them. It might not even be obvious what we're getting out of it. For some, it is financial gain or feelings of power, but very often it is (ironically) just to bolster our self-image as "good people," who therefore deserve to get away with more. A deep part of us recognizes this deceit, but we carefully hide it away from conscious self-reflection.

We feel like we are teaching the other person a lesson, but they may not even be (knowingly) doing anything wrong. They may be honestly doing the best they can, in which case we're harming an innocent person. But even if they _are_ knowingly doing wrong, it's only because they're under the sway of _precisely_ the same self-deception that we presently are. Either way, the only "lesson" they learn is that this world is a dark and phony place; that the Light is just a myth. Whatever temporary benefit we may achieve — such as suppressing their (public) misbehavior — this powerfully reinforces their self-deception. This in turn proves to _us_ that the world is a nasty place, thus requiring our "righteous" escalation.

<p align="center" width="100%"><img width="300px" src="img/half-evil.png"></p>

You have _no idea_ how good your subconscious is at telegraphing your darkness to others while simultaneously hiding it from yourself. This combination sets up perfect feedback loop, in which you can trigger the darkness in others while convincing yourself that it's their fault. And this is far from the only way that your darkness leaks out. As long as you are harboring any hardness or hostility in your heart, it _will_ find its way into the world, one way or another, without your conscious knowledge. Except it's not truly unconscious: it is always available to consciousness, if we choose to look. The problem is that we _choose not to look_.

Here is the choice that confronts each one of us: to become aware of having chosen to look away — and thereby discover that this is how _all_ evil works, and that our self-righteous judgement therefore has no basis whatsoever — or to continue to delude ourselves, descending into deeper and deeper realms of self-deception, darkening the world in increasingly clever ways, ever-more convinced of our righteousness.

---

Evil is actually an absence masquerading as a presence. The absence of what? Of a particular insight.

The ultimate truth is that you are everyone and everything, in a profound and surprising sense. It is said that this is only fully realized upon _enlightenment,_ but all of us can sense it at all times, to some degree or another. Yet we hide it from ourselves. It is only by overlooking this astonishing truth that anyone is able to harm anyone else (or our planet), through objectification; dehumanization. This is the core of self-deception; the origin of all contempt; the root of all evil.

But although it is an absence, it behaves very convincingly like a presence. When you look in the eyes of someone in the grip of this delusion, you see the _presence_ of evil. This is the moment of truth. If you choose profound honesty, you will be forced to admit that the same potential exists within you, and you will gain at least some insight in how to alleviate theirs, commensurate with your willingness; your deep compassion. This will contribute to the healing of the world. Compassion is never truly "for" a person, but for everything at once.

Your darkness, on the other hand, seduces you into believing that you could never be like them; that you are _fundamentally superior_. If you accede, you will perceive them as _intrinsically defective_, thus inspiring contempt. Their darkness will instantly recognize itself in you, and the game is on. Now both yours and theirs are secretly _allied_, knowing that they can freely spread darkness in the world with the implicit permission of you, their hosts. You have both willingly gone unconscious; delegated your sovereignty.

<p align="center" width="100%"><img width="300px" src="img/parasite.png"></p>

It is that devil on your shoulder. It is a kind of mental parasite, fundamentally extrinsic to your mind. But unlike in the cartoons, it doesn't just whisper obviously-bad ideas into your ear. No, it alters your very perception so that other people's devils appear intrinsic. This way, you will feel justified in shoving them deeper into the abyss in the name of "good." Everyone else is treated sweetly and gingerly, as if to prove to ourselves and the world which team we are fighting for.

<p align="center" width="100%"><img width="300px" src="img/good-vs-bad.png"></p>

But our devils are more than just allied. With enough sensitivity, you will see that they behave more like outgrowths of a single distributed malevolent entity — the _Devil,_ if you will. It hides itself in our subconscious, flowing freely between minds, with none of us ever detecting its presence, convinced that we are uniquely immune to its sinister charms. It continually drives humanity toward various kinds of Armageddon: situations in which everyone is violently proving how _righteous_ they are. It is why the US is headed toward civil war without anyone suspecting their own complicity, and explains bitter [divorces](https://www.gottman.com/blog/this-one-thing-is-the-biggest-predictor-of-divorce/) in which each side feels like the exclusive victim / hero. Nearly the whole world is caught in its terrible sway, evil provoking "righteous" retribution at every turn, without anyone ever noticing the true source of it all.

It is said that the elites are playing us off each other to take attention off of them, but the Devil is playing a _much_ bigger game — one in which even the elites are merely pawns. It tricks you into hating them specifically so that you will empower it — and thereby empower _them_. It is the reason that nothing ever seems to change. It accomplishes this by convincing you that your compassion isn't powerful enough to combat their evil; that your darkness is required.

It is that "evil global conspiracy" that some people fear exists: a covert entity responsible for all the world's ills, that hides itself so perfectly that nobody ever suspects its existence, let alone that they are in on it. They cannot even see it when it is clearly and explicitly pointed out. It is _that_ good. It is the _primordial_ evil conspiracy; the one to which all the rest ultimately filter up, and to which they owe their existence. Every act of unkindness you've ever perpetrated on anyone; all the hardness you carry in your heart; has only ever been in its service. The evil conspiracy really exists, and (nearly) every one of us is secretly in on it. It is our refusal to acknowledge this that keeps it alive.

The only way to fight it is to stop playing its sordid game and remember a power that you have that is _far greater_.

---

The Light is not just a myth; it is your most fundamental nature. Whereas your devil is extrinsic, your compassion is _intrinsic._ It is the very root of who and what you are. When you discover this in its entirety, you see it in everyone else, too — because, after all, they _are_ you. It is your most sacred duty as a human to remember this, so that you can share it freely with others (though paradoxically, if you still see them as "other," and yourself as their noble savior, then this isn't quite it).

Your compassion is not weak — indeed, it is the most powerful force there is. It is the _only_ thing that can genuinely dispel evil, for precisely the same reason that light is the only thing that can dispel darkness: the latter is nothing but the _absence_ of the former. Yet treating it like a presence can be skillful, because then you will not underestimate its terrifying capacity to grip minds and bring the whole world to its knees. This compassion must be paired with _wisdom,_ which is the knowledge of how best to put it into fierce and uncompromising practice. That takes time to develop, and is beyond the scope of this piece. It is only with great wisdom that one can evict the darkness from the most infected of minds without getting sucked in oneself.

Such compassion may look nothing like "compassion" in the conventional sense. It can look like mocking or shaming, violence, or even _apparent_ contempt. Almost nothing is off-limits. Yet it has the opposite effect of the same actions undertaken with contempt. Two behaviors that look nearly identical on the surface can thus have dramatically different long-term effects; one sending ripples of darkness into the world, and the other of Light. Please forgive the poetic expression; I don't know how else to put it. But it is something you can discover concretely. The darkness preys on our inability to distinguish the two, which is how it convinces us that our intentions don't matter, that compassion is weak, and that contempt is righteous.

Our enemy is never truly other people, but the darkness that has overtaken all of our minds. May we learn to see this clearly, and free this world of the illusion that has overtaken it. May we remember our Light.

> _For so long as the root of wickedness is hidden, it is strong. But when it is recognized, it is dissolved. When it is revealed, it perishes. ... It is powerful because we have not recognized it._ — The Gospel of Philip

We've all heard that "hate cannot drive out hate," but is it really true? What about something milder, like contempt? Surely contempt for _bad people_ can make the world a better place — certainly more so than being kind?

---

The truth is that every one of us engages in small (or not so small) behaviors to help ourselves gain an advantage at the expense of the world — and we have varying degrees of self-awareness about how and when (and even whether) we do this. Part of us knows _perfectly well_ that our behavior is wrong — according to our _own_ deepest standards, and not anyone else's — but that knowledge is very carefully shielded from conscious self-reflection; from the part of us that would put an end to it if only it knew. Instead, all we hear is our own clever justifications.

Of course, some people's behavior is so egregious that it's hard to believe that _any_ part of them doesn't know. It seems like even their "deepest standards" are rotten. But what's actually happening is that their self-deception is _especially_ powerful. If you want a world in which people don't act that way, you have to end the phenomenon of self-deception. Looking around at human behavior, this seems like an impossible task. People appear intrinsically selfish. But the truth is that we make it much harder than it has to be, by compounding it with our own self-deception.

If you look carefully enough into your mind while feeling malice, contempt[^contempt], or even self-righteousness, you'll find that they are _always_ self-deception: part of you is knowingly darkening the world in some way to benefit yourself. It might not even be obvious what you're getting out of it. For some people it is about financial gain or feelings of power, but very often it is (ironically) just to bolster our self-image as "good people" — who therefore deserve to get away with more.

[^contempt]: It is important to distinguish between contempt for ideas and behaviors, and for people themselves. The former can indeed be helpful.

<p align="center" width="100%"><img width="300px" src="./img/half-evil.png"></p>

When your contempt is directed at "bad people," they subconsciously recognize what you're actually doing, which makes them feel more justified in doing it themselves. This in turn proves to you that they really are delusional and irredeemable, which licenses you to escalate your righteous wrath. It is impossible to overstate how clever your subconscious is at telegraphing your darkness to others while hiding it from yourself, so that you can provoke them while convincing yourself that it's their fault. Your target doesn't even have to be present: any hardness or hostility that you harbor in your heart _will_ find its way into the world, one way or another, darkening it without your conscious knowledge. Unfortunately, it's not truly unconscious: it is always available to consciousness, if only we choose to look. But we _choose not to look_.

---

> _And no wonder, for even Satan masquerades as an angel of light. So it is not strange that his ministers also masquerade as ministers of righteousness._ —2 Corinthians 11:14-16
 
This is how we darken the world while supposedly "fighting evil." What's happening on the _surface_ of our minds affects reality far less than the stuff happening much deeper; in places that we may not even have conscious access to yet. It doesn't matter how noble your stated intentions are: if there's self-deception operating, you _will_ make the world a darker place; one more rife with self-deception — and you will be flawlessly convinced that you are helping. In fact, your behavior may actually _be_ helpful — at least for a time. It may temporarily suppress their misbehavior (in public, anyway), but under the surface, the darkness is spreading.

It would be unkind to blame you for this, even though part of you knows it fully well. That's because the very deepest part of you doesn't actually want to be doing it. But something in you feels that it doesn't have a choice; that the cruel world has forced your hand, and you're doing what you must. This is all completely understandable — for both you and literally everyone else, if you look hard enough. Everyone is caught in some version of the very same trap; some so deeply that we cannot recognize it. Your choice is to either shove them deeper in — which you will surely get away with, given how "righteous" it is in the eyes of the people you surround yourself with — or to help pull them out; to extend them the grace that you yourself so profoundly deserve — and to thereby rid the world of at least a tiny bit of "evil."

The latter is called _kindness_ or _compassion_. To be clear, it does **not** mean being nice, or gentle, or tolerant, or even understanding. It simply means being free of self-deception; of the pernicious illusion that you are somehow special and incorruptible. We judge[^judge] others because somewhere deep down we are judging ourselves. When the latter stops, the former does too — and the latter only ends when we have finally unearthed every last place in which we hide our true intentions from ourselves. Once this happens, it is literally impossible to feel contempt, because you see clearly that this sentiment exists _only_ to perpetuate dark patterns in the world; patterns that enable us all to avoid that within us which we're not yet ready to confront.

[^judge]: To be clear, "judgement" here means _contemptuous_ judgement. Judgement in the sense of wise discernment is of course good. Another word like this is "outrage," which often has a self-righteous component to it, much to everyone's detriment.

Genuine kindness can be fierce or even violent. Almost nothing is off-limits. It may look nothing like "kindness" from the outside, but on the inside you always know — and subconsciously, so does everyone else. Your judgement then carries the weight of authenticity, which their minds cannot use as an excuse for more self-deception. It is as though their darkness can no longer get the "grip" it needs to justify itself. It is instead confronted by a blinding Light, which is the one thing that it cannot withstand. It's not even something that you are _doing_, per se; it is simply what remains in the mind once self-deception — darkness — has vanished. Not just for you or the "good people," but for everyone.

Make no mistake: it would be foolish to pretend that evil doesn't exist. It surely does in some sense. In fact, from a certain perspective, it appears sentient; almost intelligent. It is that devil on your shoulder — but unlike in the cartoons, it doesn't just whisper obviously-bad ideas in your ear; no, it alters your very perception such that evil appears unmistakably _righteous._ You and I may be enemies, but our devils are secretly allied; yours triggering mine, which triggers yours back, etc., leading to that all-too-familiar descent into Hell. In fact, if you look carefully, you will see that our devils aren't truly separate: they behave more like a _single distributed malevolent entity_: the _Devil_, if you will.

It is that "evil global conspiracy" that some people fear exists: a covert entity responsible for all the world's ills, that hides itself so perfectly that nobody ever suspects its existence, let alone that they themselves are in on it.

---

Your enemy is never truly other people, but the darkness that has ensnared all of our minds. It is not _intrinsic_ to any mind: that is a sinister illusion that the "Devil" uses to get you to do its dark bidding. Ultimately, MLK indeed said it best:

Why do wise people urge compassion for evildoers? Are they being naïve? Or could it be that they see something that we don't?

---

Consider the "bad people" — the greedy bankers, hypocritical CEOs, corrupt politicians, etc. — and how they're able to screw over others without apparent remorse. It really makes your blood boil, doesn't it? What has happened is that their minds have altered their perception of reality such that other people appear fundamentally inferior; subhuman, and thus acceptable to harm.

Do they know that they're doing this? Well, yes and no. Part of them knows _perfectly well_, of course — but that knowledge is cleverly shielded from conscious self-reflection. All they hear are their own justifications. It is this state that has enabled _all the evil there ever was_ — and it has enabled our own misbehavior too, if we're honest. Every one of us has skirted our conscience before, pretending either that we couldn't hear it or that we didn't have to listen. We have secretly licensed ourselves to gain some advantage at the expense of the world. Our examples may differ in degree, but not in kind.

This mind-state is infectious: simply by engaging in it, the "bad people" induce it in others. The dark part of their mind is trying to spread it, because the more normalized it becomes, the less they will have to confront it in themselves. This allows it to remain hidden. That part _wants_ you to hate them — because the darker your perception becomes, the more you will abandon your own deepest values, licensing yourself to behave in ways that you otherwise couldn't, and thereby spreading the infection yourself. But _you won't realize that you're doing this._ You will feel flawlessly convinced that you are "fighting evil" — and how could that ever be wrong?

You will even have evidence to prove it. Your darkness can indeed suppress other people's misbehavior — at least, their _public_ misbehavior, for a time. You will thus convince yourself that it "worked." But even if you manage to violently eradicate your enemies, doing so from this profoundly dark place will powerfully awaken the shadows of every person whose mind it touches, directly or indirectly, "friend" or "foe" — and a secret part of your mind will know that did this, because it is _doing it on purpose_. You have no idea how good your mind is at generating darkness while convincing you that it's somebody else's fault.

<p align="center" width="100%"><img width="300px" src="img/devil-vs-devil.png"></p>

In that darkened state, you're not just licensing yourself to hate "bad people," like you tell yourself. Your mind uses this liminal space to get away with all manner of hidden desires; desires that you may not even realize you have. For some people, it is about money or power, but for others it is (ironically) about looking and feeling like "good people" — people who therefore deserve to get away with _more_.

What happened is that your darkness heard the clarion call of theirs, recognizing it as a perfect opportunity to lure you into this state for its own sinister purposes, under the guise of "good." It is a kind of "secret handshake" between their shadow and yours. You have now become a silent beacon of the darkness yourself — but you won't (consciously) recognize it. You will be convinced that it is noble, and your ideology will support this belief.

What happens on the surface of our minds — our "good intentions" — ultimately matters far less than the covert activity taking place underneath; activity that most of us are normally unconscious of. It is this hidden activity that secretly runs the world.

<p align="center" width="100%"> <img width="300px" src="img/evil-above-world.png"> </p>

Contempt for other people (as opposed to their _beliefs_ or _behaviors_) is only ever a sign of self-deception. Any action taken from this state _will_ darken the world in some way that you will be unconscious of — except that it's not truly unconscious. **It is entirely accessible to consciousness, if only we look. The problem is that we choose not to look — for _precisely_ the same reason that the "bad people" never do:** beyond a certain point, it is too painful to confront what we have done. We are in too deep.

> _And no wonder, for even Satan masquerades as an angel of light. So it is not strange that his ministers also masquerade as ministers of righteousness._ —2 Corinthians 11:14-16

The more carefully you look, the more you discover the distinctive fingerprints of your own darkness imprinted on events distant in time and space; events that you previously never would have dreamed of having any connection to. All the darkness you have ever leaked into this world still remains, patiently waiting for you to clean it up — and you can identify it in the places that trigger you the most; the places that elicit _self-righteous outrage_. At the same time, these are where you will feel the most justified to layer on _more_ — and where your "allies" will support you in doing so. In fact, this is what most "alliance" really is: dividing us into categories of justifications for cruelty. This way, we never suspect our true enemy. It is the _perfect_ trap. In fact, it almost smells... designed.

From a certain perspective, the darkness appears sentient; even intelligent. It is that phenomenon that the ancients knew as the _Devil_[^devil]: a distributed malevolent entity manipulating all of our minds, communicating with itself beneath our conscious thresholds; subtly altering our perceptions, while convincing us that it doesn't exist — or that it doesn't exist within _us_, the righteous. Ironically, this is the _surest_ sign that our mind has been overtaken.

In more modern terms, it is the "evil global conspiracy": a secret cabal pulling all the strings, and yet hidden so well that nobody even suspects its existence — let alone that _part of their own mind is secretly in on it_.

You can think of this as an allegory, but you can also learn to perceive it clearly and directly.

It is easy to sense its sinister presence in classically dark places – the archetypal "locker room" in which men dehumanize women, which later manifests in unspeakable conduct. With a little more sensitivity, you can detect it in the places where people gather to _hate_ men for doing this — and with more still, in the defensive reactions that cause men to believe that no such phenomenon could possibly exist simply because they are unable to see it yet. On and on it goes, effortlessly slithering through minds.

Countless similar patterns exist, for race, religion... you name it. Just visit any Facebook group and witness throngs of people being casually cruel to each other, believing that they're making things better — not realizing that they are simply feeding the Beast. We are all fighting a common enemy, and yet it has convinced us that we will overcome it by viciously fighting each other.

[^devil]: Though in some versions, he is just a _tempter_: he is checking whether you will abandon God (or your inner Light) but has no power (or even desire) to make you do so. I like this variant, because it makes it clear that that decision is entirely on us.

The elites may well be playing us off each other to take attention off of them, but the Devil is playing a _much_ bigger game — one in which even the elites are merely pawns. It tricks you into hating them specifically to draw your attention away from its presence in your own mind — the one place you actually have the power to dispel it, and from there, liberate other minds. It convinces you that your compassion isn't powerful enough to combat evil; that it is something soft and weak. This is a dark lie. Compassion is the _only_ thing capable of genuinely dispelling evil — because it is the only condition that is genuinely _free_ of it.

---

The classic image of the angel and devil on your shoulders is almost correct, except for two things. 

First, your devil doesn't just whisper obviously-bad ideas in your ear, like in the cartoons; no, it alters your very perception such that certain evils appear unmistakably righteous. It is extrinsic to your mind; a kind of parasite — and like all parasites, it can be evicted.

<p align="center" width="100%"><img width="300px" src="./img/parasite.png"></p>

Your angel, on the other hand, is intrinsic. It is a metaphor for that place in your mind that the devil can never touch; the very deepest part of you; your fundamental goodness. It is what remains when all self-deception evaporates.

Your angel can see perfectly well that other people's minds have merely been hijacked by their devils; that it's not intrinsic to their nature. Even those who have _knowingly invited it in_ — and make no mistake, some people have — deserve to be freed of it. Contempt is nothing but the violent urge to shove them _deeper into_ its clutches, where we will feel even more licensed to be cruel, in a vicious feedback loop.

That is why your devil's cleverest trick is to make _other people's_ devils appear intrinsic. Think about the "bad people." Don't they seem _fundamentally morally defective,_ and thus entirely unlike us? By definition such people cannot be helped; they can only be punished or subdued. The truth is, you don't actually know who can be freed and who cannot — and the only reason to believe they cannot is to make harming them feel righteous. It is a trap. Compassion is simply freedom from this pernicious illusion.

> _For so long as the root of wickedness is hidden, it is strong. But when it is recognized, it is dissolved. When it is revealed, it perishes. ... It is powerful because we have not recognized it._ — The Gospel of Philip

Compassion does not have to be nice. In fact, the more ensnared by darkness a person is, the more fierce — or even _violent_ — compassion for them must be. It can look like mocking and shaming, or even _apparent_ contempt or hatred. Almost nothing is off-limits. At the same time, the easier it becomes to lie to yourself about your true intentions: are you being of genuine service to the world, or using it as cover for something much darker?

It is precisely this difficulty that the Devil uses to sneak into your mind undetected. It knows that you will use the _content_ of your thoughts — "oh, I'm just protecting the innocent" — to determine the morality of your actions, and so it generates exceedingly clever justifications that it knows will fool you. The more you listen to it, the smarter it gets, until even thoughts that once would have struck you as obviously-evil now seem unmistakably good. That is why you must learn to see _past_ your thoughts, and hear a voice that is much deeper.

<p align="center" width="100%"><img width="300px" src="./img/half-evil.png"></p>

Part of you _always_ knows which voice you are listening to, and everything comes down to becoming conscious of it. I can't tell you how to do it, but luckily, the deepest part of you already knows. There are also a few hints that can be helpful.

If there is even a _trace_ of malice, contempt (for the person), or self-righteousness, then it is *always* your shadow. Same with seeing the world in black and white: dividing people into the _intrinsically_ good and bad; victims and perpetrators; those who deserve your compassion and those who deserve your hatred[^films]. It will make a big show of being sweet to the victims and cruel to the perpetrators, as a way of keeping you in the dark about what is really going. You will not recognize it in yourself, but others very much can (if only subconsciously). Unless they are relatively free of the darkness themselvdes, they will feel contempt for you, thus "unknowingly" perpetuating the cycle.

---

Your true enemy is not other people, but the darkness that has infected all of our minds. Everything comes down to seeing how it has hijacked both ourselves and others, and recognizing what help we can offer to free them of it — whether that requires patience and understanding, or wrath and ferocity. The more you become free yourself, the more you recognize what is needed in others.

[^films]: Revenge fantasy films are attempting to make you see the world this way. That's right, they are the work of "the Devil."

You do not deserve contemptuous judgement for having spread evil, even if some part of you is doing it knowingly — and _especially_ if you are not ready to see it yet. Doing so would just drive it deeper into your mind. You've simply fallen prey to a very elaborate scheme; the most devious and insidious one possible. Its whole trick is to convince you that _other people_ are ultimately responsible for it, when they, too, are caught in its insane web. Compassion is simply the intention to pull people _out_ of this trap instead of shoving them _deeper in_. To be effective, it must be paired with _wisdom_, which is the knowledge of how to turn that intention into action. Such wisdom is the work of a lifetime, and is beyond the scope of this piece.

Said another way, _compassion is nothing but freedom from self-deception_, and in that way can never be the wrong motivation. It means having clear insight into the part of you that is every bit as fallible and corruptible as the worst among us. However much credit you wish to take for resisting it, you have to admit that tremendous amounts of grace were involved — and that you're probably _still_ nowhere near free of it. It is exactly this grace that you have to offer others.

Ironically, we eventually discover that our resistance to sharing this gift is because part of us isn't ready to accept it ourselves. This is the hardest part to talk about, because it transcends our usual perceptions of ourselves and the world. Everything you do to the world you ultimately do to yourself, because in a profound and surprising sense, [_you are the world_](unity.md). Realizing this is sometimes called _enlightenment_. Your desire to forsake others is ultimately an attempt to forsake yourself, because you're not ready to "come home" yet. These words might not mean much to you now, but part of you can always sense their truth.

Ultimately, the reason to show "other people" compassion is that it's the _only_ path to the more beautiful world your heart most secretly longs for[^Charles]. All else is illusion.

> _Be kind, for everyone you meet is fighting a great battle._ —Author unknown

Why do wise people urge compassion for evildoers? Are they being naïve? Or could it be that they see something that we don't?

---

Consider the "bad people" — the greedy bankers, hypocritical CEOs, corrupt politicians, etc. — and how they're able to screw over others without apparent remorse. It really makes your blood boil, doesn't it? What has happened is that their minds have altered their perception of reality such that other people appear fundamentally inferior; subhuman, and thus acceptable to harm.

Do they know that they're doing this? Well, yes and no. Part of them knows _perfectly well_, of course — but that knowledge is carefully shielded from conscious self-reflection. All they hear are their own clever justifications. It is this state that has enabled _all the evil there ever was_ — and it has enabled our own misbehavior too, if we're honest. Every one of us has skirted our conscience before, pretending either that we couldn't hear it or that we didn't have to listen. Our examples may differ in degree, but not in kind.

This mind-state is infectious: simply by engaging in it, the "bad people" induce it in others. The dark part of their mind is trying to spread it, because the more normalized it becomes, the less they will have to confront it in themselves. This allows it to remain hidden. That part _wants_ you to hate them — because the darker your perception becomes, the more you will abandon your own deepest values, licensing yourself to behave in ways that you otherwise couldn't, and thereby spreading the infection yourself. But _you won't realize that you're doing this._ You will feel flawlessly convinced that you are "fighting evil" — and how could that ever be wrong?

You will even have evidence to prove it. Your darkness can indeed suppress other people's misbehavior — at least, their _public_ misbehavior, for a time. You will thus convince yourself that it "worked." But even if you manage to violently eradicate your enemies, doing so from this profoundly dark place will powerfully awaken the shadows of every person whose mind it touches, directly or indirectly, "friend" or "foe" — and a secret part of your mind will know that did this, because it is _doing it on purpose_. You have no idea how good your mind is at generating darkness while convincing you that it's somebody else's fault.

<p align="center" width="100%"><img width="300px" src="img/devil-vs-devil.png"></p>

In that darkened state, you're not just licensing yourself to hate "bad people," like you tell yourself. Your mind uses this liminal space to get away with all manner of hidden desires; desires that you may not even realize you have. For some people, it is about money or power, but for others it is (ironically) about looking and feeling like "good people" — people who therefore deserve to get away with _more_.

What happened is that your darkness heard the clarion call of theirs, recognizing it as a perfect opportunity to lure you into this state for its own sinister purposes, under the guise of "good." It is a kind of "secret handshake" between their shadow and yours. You have now become a silent beacon of the darkness yourself — but you won't (consciously) recognize it. You will be convinced that it is noble, and your ideology will support this belief.

What happens on the surface of our minds — our "good intentions" — ultimately matters far less than the covert activity taking place underneath; activity that most of us are normally unconscious of. It is this hidden activity that secretly runs the world.

<p align="center" width="100%"> <img width="300px" src="img/evil-above-world.png"> </p>

Contempt for other people (as opposed to their _beliefs_ or _behaviors_) is only ever a sign of self-deception. Any action taken from this state _will_ darken the world in some way that you will be unconscious of — except that it's not truly unconscious. **It is entirely accessible to consciousness, if only we look. The problem is that we choose not to look — for _precisely_ the same reason that the "bad people" never do:** beyond a certain point, it is too painful to confront what we have done. We are in too deep.

> _And no wonder, for even Satan masquerades as an angel of light. So it is not strange that his ministers also masquerade as ministers of righteousness._ —2 Corinthians 11:14-16

The more carefully you look, the more you discover the distinctive fingerprints of your own darkness imprinted on events distant in time and space; events that you previously never would have dreamed of having any connection to. All the darkness you have ever leaked into this world still remains, patiently waiting for you to clean it up — and you can identify it in the places that trigger you the most; the places that elicit _self-righteous outrage_. At the same time, these are where you will feel the most justified to layer on _more_ — and where your "allies" will support you in doing so. In fact, this is what most "alliance" really is: dividing us into categories of justifications for cruelty. This way, we never suspect our true enemy. It is the _perfect_ trap. In fact, it almost smells... designed.

From a certain perspective, the darkness appears sentient; even intelligent. It is that phenomenon that the ancients knew as the _Devil_[^devil]: a distributed malevolent entity manipulating all of our minds, communicating with itself beneath our conscious thresholds; subtly altering our perceptions, while convincing us that it doesn't exist — or that it doesn't exist within _us_, the righteous. Ironically, this is the _surest_ sign that our mind has been overtaken.

In more modern terms, it is the "evil global conspiracy": a secret cabal pulling all the strings, and yet hidden so well that nobody even suspects its existence — let alone that _part of their own mind is secretly in on it_. It is the _primordial_ evil conspiracy; the one to which all the rest owe their existence, and to which they ultimately filter up — and we are its minions.

<p align="center" width="100%"><img width="300px" src="./img/shared-devil.png"></p>

You can think of this as an allegory, but you can also learn to perceive it clearly and directly.

It is easy to sense its sinister presence in classically dark places – the archetypal "locker room" in which men dehumanize women, which later manifests in unspeakable conduct. With a little more sensitivity, you can detect it in the places where people gather to _hate_ men for doing this — and with more still, in the defensive reactions that cause men to believe that no such phenomenon could possibly exist simply because they are unable to see it yet. On and on it goes, effortlessly slithering through minds.

Countless similar patterns exist, for race, religion... you name it. Just visit any Facebook group and witness throngs of people being casually cruel to each other, believing that they're making things better — not realizing that they are simply feeding the Beast. We are all fighting a common enemy, and yet it has convinced us that we will overcome it by viciously fighting each other.

> _For so long as the root of wickedness is hidden, it is strong. But when it is recognized, it is dissolved. When it is revealed, it perishes. ... It is powerful because we have not recognized it._ — The Gospel of Philip

We think that hating "bad people" is a sign of the good within us, but it's actually a sign of something _much darker_.

People are only able to cause willful harm due to a kind of self-deception: part of them knows _perfectly well_ that they are doing wrong, but that knowledge is carefully shielded from conscious self-reflection. All they hear are their own clever justifications. It is this mechanism that has enabled _all the evil there ever was_ — and it has enabled our own misbehavior too, if we're honest. We have all skirted our conscience before, pretending either that we couldn't hear it or that we didn't have to listen.

When we encounter a person in this state, we often don't recognize a fellow human under the sway of a powerful illusion; one that we ourselves are all-too-susceptible to. No, we see them as _fundamentally defective_ and thus worthy of only contempt. Such a person by definition cannot be helped; they can only be subdued or punished — and it is our righteous duty to do so. This is what we tell ourselves, but it is an insidious lie.

<p align="center" width="100%"><img width="300px" src="./img/half-evil.png"></p>

---

A mind that is free of self-deception is incapable of feeling contempt. It sees that although people have indeed _chosen_ to follow their darkness in a sense, that choice is ultimately rooted in a kind of confusion — one that contempt is secretly designed to _reinforce_. We mock and shame our enemies specifically so that they will dig in their heels, enabling us to escalate while plausibly blaming it on them.

We are in fact _choosing_ to do this in one sense, but it's ultimately rooted in a kind of confusion. **_Any_ time we choose our ideologies or agendas over our kindness, we are acting from confusion**. Such confusion is contagious: simply by engaging in it, we induce it in others — such as our aforementioned enemies. Our mind is secretly giving them permission to enter the same shadowy state that we have licensed in ourselves. This is why "the road to hell is paved with good intentions": our _conscious_ intentions are rarely our _true_ intentions.

> _And no wonder, for even Satan masquerades as an angel of light. So it is not strange that his ministers also masquerade as ministers of righteousness._ —2 Corinthians 11:14-16

This is the secret mechanism by which nearly all evil spreads, nearly undetected. We all have places where we lie to ourselves about our real motivations, in subtle and not-so-subtle ways — and by doing so, we covertly authorize others to do the same. It is a kind of secret handshake; a kind of deal with the Devil — one that you can learn to perceive. We act shocked and dismayed at its outcome — but only so that we can use it as justification to _intensify_ the process.

We're not doing this because we are _evil_, per se — although that is what evil ultimately boils down to: the willingness to look away. We're doing it because there are aspects of our mind that feel that they aren't getting what they need, and must provide cover to get it without being judged. All of this dark activity serves to provide that cover. The darker the state of the world, the easier it becomes to look away from what our own minds are doing. But we must never admit that we're doing this; there must always be "bad people" to blame.

From a certain perspective, this shadowy activity appears sentient; even intelligent. The darkness in our minds is _coordinating_; each provoking the other while carefully hiding itself from us, its hosts.

The whole division between "bad people" and "good people"; those "in on it" and those not, is the most devious sham. That distinction doesn't exist in reality, but only in your mind, and only to provide your conscious mind with a bright line beyond which you need not question your intentions. Everyone on "this" side of the line must be treated with cloying sweetness — or what we confuse for "compassion" — and everyone on "that" side with cruelty, to prove to ourselves and the world which team we are on.

To be clear: there are indeed people so thoroughly mired in darkness that "confusion" doesn't begin to describe the depths of their depravity. All this means is that their darkness is _especially_ good at seducing us into our shadows, where we will gleefully abandon our deepest integrity, not realizing what we've done until it is far too late. That darkness is not intrinsic to even their minds, and malice for them is _especially_ "evil." They represent the jackpot: an avenue to unleash our own darkness with impunity.

The more carefully we look, the more we discover the distinctive fingerprints of our own darkness imprinted on events distant in time and space; events that we previously never would have dreamed of having any connection to, let alone complicity in. All the darkness we have ever leaked into this world still remains, patiently waiting for us to clean it up — and we can identify it in the places that trigger us the most; those that elicit _self-righteous outrage_. At the same time, these are where we feel the most justified in layering on more — and where our "allies" support us most in doing so.

<p align="center" width="100%"><img width="300px" src="./img/parasite.png"></p>

The _only_ weapon we have against the darkness is our inner Light. **Our thoughts, ideologies, and agendas cannot tell us whether we are acting with integrity,** because those can all be freely manipulated by our darkness. Everything comes down to our deep honesty about whether we are acting from our profound Love for all of reality or merely our ideas about "right" and "wrong." This is a Love that excludes nothing and forsakes no-one — but also does not shy away from being fierce (or even violent) when the situation warrants it. This is true compassion, and it has nothing to do with being "nice."

This Love is what you ultimately _are_ — what _everyone_ ultimately is. This may sound "woo-woo," but it is something you can learn to perceive directly. You _are_ everyone and everything, in a profound and surprising sense, just pretending that you're not. "Evil" is ultimately nothing but our attempt to avoid seeing this, because we are not ready to come Home yet. People cannot be forced to see it, and _trying_ to is madness; a reliable indicator that you yourself have forgotten. But the more you remember it yourself, the more your behavior serves as a reminder to "others."

Such behavior need not look anything like "compassion" or "love" in the conventional sense. It may be fierce or violent, perhaps looking like mocking and shaming. It may require _apparent_ contempt. But it arises from a very different source, and has a very different impact on all minds involved, whether the people consciously realize it or not. This is the secret mechanism by which the _Light_ spreads.

At its fiercest, the Light can look almost indistinguishable from darkness — _almost._ Consciously, they can be hard to tell apart, but your subconscious always knows. Our darkness relies on this apparent difficulty to sneak in, but the most humbling discovery is that this difficulty was only ever apparent. It was never truly "subconscious": it was always perfectly accessible to consciousness, if only we had looked. But _we chose not to look._ Thus, we never had a leg to stand on when judging others for making the same choice.

I wish I had a nugget of wisdom to share about real, practical ways to put this knowledge to use. Alas, I am a mere fledgling myself. All I know is that I wish to stop playing the dark game that we have inherited, and exchange it for a more beautiful one. I only hope that you will join me — and that you will hold my feet to the fire when I pretend to forget myself.

We think that hating "bad people" is a sign of the good within us, but it's actually a sign of something _much darker_.

People are only able to cause willful harm due to a kind of self-deception: part of them knows _perfectly well_ that they are doing wrong, but that knowledge is carefully shielded from conscious self-reflection. All they hear are their own clever justifications. It is this secret mechanism that has enabled _all the evil there ever was_ — and it has enabled our own misbehavior too, if we're honest. We have all skirted our conscience before, pretending either that we couldn't hear it or that we didn't have to listen.

When we encounter a person in this state, we often don't recognize a fellow human under the sway of a powerful illusion; one that we ourselves are all-too-susceptible to. No, we see them as _fundamentally defective_ and thus worthy of only contempt. Such a person by definition cannot be helped; they can only be subdued or punished — and it is our righteous duty to do so. This is what we tell ourselves, but it is an insidious lie.

<p align="center" width="100%"><img width="300px" src="./img/half-evil.png"></p>

---

A mind that is free of self-deception is simply incapable of feeling contempt. It sees that although people have indeed _chosen_ to follow their darkness in one sense, that choice is ultimately rooted in a kind of confusion — one that contempt is secretly designed to _reinforce_. We mock and shame our enemies specifically so that they will dig in their heels, enabling us to escalate while plausibly blaming it on them.

We are in fact _choosing_ to do this in one sense, but it's ultimately rooted in a kind of confusion. **_Any_ time we choose our ideologies or agendas over our kindness, we are acting from confusion**. It is contagious: simply by engaging in it, we induce it in others — such as our aforementioned enemies. Our mind is giving them secret permission to enter the same shadowy state that we have licensed ourselves to be in.

The way this works is _insanely_ clever: by pretending to be _fundamentally superior_ to others — contempt — we are telegraphing our own self-deception in a way that is subconsciously obvious to them but hidden from us. This provokes the same pattern in them, but gives our minds plausible deniability, so that we will never have to confront what we have done. It is a kind of willful ignorance.

> _And no wonder, for even Satan masquerades as an angel of light. So it is not strange that his ministers also masquerade as ministers of righteousness._ —2 Corinthians 11:14-16

This is the hidden mechanism by which nearly all evil spreads, undetected. We all have places in our lives where we lie to ourselves about our true motivations, in subtle and not-so-subtle ways — and by doing so, we covertly authorize others to do the same. It is a kind of secret handshake — one that you can learn to perceive. Your mind enters the shadow space without alerting you, to invite others in without alerting them. This way, none of us have to face what we are really doing.

We feel that the dark state of our world must be due to individuals who are completely unlike us, and whose violent elimination would bring peace — because _we_ would never let things get this way.

The more your own darkness is dispelled, the more you see the sense in which nobody could ultimately want to be possessed by theirs — even those who have convinced themselves and the world that they do.

Why do wise people urge compassion for evildoers? Are they being naïve? Or could it be that they see something that we don't?

Every one of us has had the experience of skirting our conscience — behaving in a way that goes against our deepest values, but that we convince ourselves is okay anyway.

Maybe we've helped ourselves to "a little extra" at the expense of a company, convinced that we're only harming its wealthy (and greedy) owners. Maybe it turns out that the owners weren't so wealthy after all, or that our cumulative behavior harmed many other people indirectly. But our minds found an excuse for those too — or else entirely blocked that knowledge from conscious awareness.

Or perhaps we were a little bit nasty to someone, convinced that they deserved it — having no deep insight into the true source of their misbehavior, and being unable to admit that we just compounded their difficulties in life. We can't see that a tiny part of them was actually trying to be better, and that our casual nastiness was the final straw that made them lose faith in humanity. To hide this, we convince ourselves that _no_ part of them was trying; that they are _fundamentally morally defective,_ and thus beyond help. But it doesn't feel like we're _convincing_ ourselves; it simply feels like "the truth."

<p align="center" width="100%"><img width="300px" src="./img/half-evil.png"></p>

As hard as it is to admit that we do this, much harder still is confronting the full impact of our behavior. All the darkness in the world is intimately connected. Every act of unkindness we commit eventually propagates into the Whole, lowering the threshold for darkness to manifest elsewhere. Each act of self-deception makes it more likely that genuine atrocities will be committed by someone, somewhere — atrocities for which we will not only feel absolutely no complicity, but which will actually trigger _self-righteous outrage_, thus inducing us to compound the problem. And part of us knows all of this.

This is the secret mechanism by which evil spreads without anyone having to take responsibility. Each one of us is only able to see the self-deception in others, provoking us to violently combat it, thus reinforcing it while flawlessly convinced that we are "helping." When you look into the eyes of a person and see "evil," what you are actually seeing is a locus where all this dark activity has accumulated especially intensely — and a seductive invitation to pile on _more_ in a way that is somehow still socially acceptable.

<p align="center" width="100%"> <img width="300px" src="img/evil-above-world.png"> </p>

You would think that the "bad people" are (or _should_ be) especially aware of their evil, but the only reason they can do it in the first place is because their self-deception is especially good at hiding it from conscious self-awareness — and our attempts to violently evict it are secretly attempts to _reinforce_ it in a way that neither we nor anyone else will ever suspect. This is why our political opponents just dig in their heels when we mock and shame them: part of us _needs_ this outcome, so that we and they can continue to act as covers for each other's darkness.

Our darkness can indeed suppress other people's misbehavior — at least, in public, and for a time. We can thus easily convince ourselves that it "worked" — but only because we choose not to look too closely at the deeper effects of our behavior. They are always there to see, if only we choose to look.

> _And no wonder, for even Satan masquerades as an angel of light. So it is not strange that his ministers also masquerade as ministers of righteousness._ —2 Corinthians 11:14-16

From a certain perspective, our cumulative shadowy activity appears sentient; even intelligent. In fact, your darkness and mine aren't truly separate: they behave more like appendages of a _distributed malevolent entity_, manipulating all of humanity from within the dark crevices of our own minds; the places where we dare not look. It is what some cultures know as the _Devil_ — and it is as "real" as anything you can touch. It keeps our attention perpetually fixated outward, on the evil "out there," so that we will never bother to look too closely "in here" — the one place where we have direct power over it.

<p align="center" width="100%"><img width="300px" src="./img/shared-devil.png"></p>

In more modern terms, it is the _evil global conspiracy_ — that secret cabal responsible for all the world's ills, yet whose full membership remains forever elusive. It is the _primordial_ evil conspiracy, to which all the rest owe their existence, and to which they ultimately filter up. All the conspiracies you can consciously identify "out there" ultimately originate from this shared hidden aspect of mind. They feel "shadowy" because they are outer reflections of our collective unconscious. To believe that you have pinned it down externally is to have fallen into its most basic trap.

It is said that the elites are playing us off one another to take attention away from themselves — but the Devil is playing a _much_ bigger game; one in which even the elites are merely pawns. It controls our perception and models of reality so completely that to even suspect its existence marks one as "insane." We feel that the dark state of our world must be due to individuals who are fundamentally unlike us, and whose violent elimination would therefore bring peace. It is astonishing that we never notice where these dark thoughts actually originate from, and what master they secretly serve.

The one weapon we have against the darkness is our Light. You could also call it kindness, or compassion.

**Compassion has nothing to do with being nice.** It is simply about being free of self-deception, so that our attempts to fight evil do not have the "unintended" consequence of creating more. From here, contempt (for people) is impossible, because you clearly see the sense in which the Darkness is impersonal, despite people obviously having _chosen_ it in some sense. Its greatest trick is to make you hate them for having done so, not realizing that this hatred is _you_ choosing the darkness yourself — and that others can subconsciously tell that you're making this choice, which licenses them to do it more, which part of you knows but cannot admit, which is what makes the choice evil in the first place.

That's a lot to unpack, so let's try again.

Contempt for "bad people" is secretly an attempt to create _more_ darkness in a way that appears righteous, to provide cover for our own self-deception. The same is true of malice and self-righteousness. It is _extremely hard_ to admit this, but other people can always tell, if only subconsciously. It thereby acts as a "secret handshake" that licenses them to do it _more_, even as we pretend to be fighting it. 

In other words, our unwillingness to confront our own darkness is what perpetuates it in the world. Indeed, it is this very unwillingness that makes it "dark" in the first place. **Evil is ultimately nothing but _the willingness to look away_ — not just from the darkness "out there," but the darkness "in here."**

But what is it that we're looking away _from_, exactly? To say that "evil is the willingness to look away from evil" would be circular.

---

There is a profound and astonishing sense in which we **are** everyone and everything. Realizing this in its entirety is known as _enlightenment_ (en-_Light_-enment), and is indeed a lofty goal — but all of us can sense it at all times, to some degree. **You are the Light.** It is why we thank other people even for acts of kindness that don't benefit us directly. We intuit that what happens to any part ultimately happens to the whole. Evil is nothing but our inability (or unwillingness) to see this.

This is why contempt is intrinsically self-deceptive: it is the pretense that we are _fundamentally better_ than others, which the deepest part of us realizes is a sham — and which they can sense too, no matter how "evil" they are. It is this common knowledge (in the [technical sense](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/common-knowledge/): that _they know that we know that they know..._) that permits evil to spread in the way described above — and ironically, it is rooted in our fundamental unity.

<p align="center" width="100%"><img width="300px" src="./img/good-vs-bad.png"></p>

Looking down on others is looking down on ourselves; harming them ultimately harms us; and forsaking them is secretly a desire to forsake ourselves, because we're not ready to come Home yet. Until we see this, literally everything we do to "fight evil" secretly perpetuates it. It is only through compassion — freedom from self-deception — that we discover how to fight evil in a way that actually works.

**Such behavior need not look anything like "compassion" in the conventional sense.** It may be fierce or violent, perhaps even manifesting as mocking and shaming. It may require _apparent_ contempt. But it arises from a very different source, and has a very different impact on all minds involved. Its deep integrity prevents the darkness in others from finding easy justification for itself. **This is the secret mechanism by which the _Light_ spreads.**

At its fiercest, the Light can look almost indistinguishable from darkness — _almost._ They can be hard to tell apart, but our subconscious always knows. It is this apparent difficulty that allows our darkness to sneak in. But the most humbling discovery is that it was never truly "subconscious": it was always perfectly accessible to consciousness, if only we had looked. Again, _we chose not to look._ We chose our agendas and ideologies instead, confusing them for our Love.

This is the most painful realization, but also the most liberating: all that is required to redeem ourselves is to _choose to look_. Doing this even once, we see that we never truly _wanted_ to look away; that we never _could_ want such a thing — and that nobody else could either, if only they knew. Our commitment to Look creates ripples throughout reality, impacting it in ways that we may never fully appreciate. This is the greatest gift we have to offer the world.

I wish I could leave you with some wisdom about real, practical ways to put this knowledge to use. Alas, such wisdom is the work of a lifetime, and I am a mere fledgling myself. All I know is that I wish to stop playing the dark game that we have inherited, and to exchange it for a more beautiful one. I only hope that you will join me — and that you will hold my feet to the fire with unflinching kindness when I (pretend to) forget.
