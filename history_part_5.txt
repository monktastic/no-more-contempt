What if nearly everything you're doing to "fight evil" is actually strengthening it — and moreover, what if part of you already knows this, but is actively concealing it from your conscious mind? What if the difficulty in admitting this to yourself is caused by the _same insidious phenomenon_ that prevents the "bad people" from acknowledging the full implications of _their_ actions? What if you and they are secretly on the same team?

These are provocative questions, but they point to an astonishing truth — one that is excruciatingly painful yet ultimately liberating. The Devil hides in the very last place you would ever look.

---

Take a moment to reflect on what's wrong with the world, and bring to mind the people responsible. Don't they seem _fundamentally morally defective_? Do you feel contempt for them, or maybe even malice? It feels like those emotions are there to help you _fight_ evil, but this is a sinister lie. They exist only to help you _darken_ the world while making you feel flawlessly convinced that you're helping.

This is not something I can convince you of, so I won't even try. But here's the thing: part of you already knows it. You don't enjoy mocking or shaming your enemies to help them (or anyone else) "see the light," or to make the world a better place. You do it to make yourself feel superior. This may temporarily suppress their (public) misbehavior, but it _will_ increase the net hostility and polarization in the world. You may tell yourself that it won't, or that it's their fault if it does, or that the benefits outweigh the drawbacks, but part of you knows that these are just lame excuses for malicious behavior.

This isn't an attack on you, though it may feel like one. That defensiveness is hiding something crucial — something that I promise you want to see. An aspect of your mind is actively preventing you from consciously acknowledging the effects of your words and actions. Why? 

Part of you _knows_ that darkness exists within you, and it does everything in its power to shield this horrifying truth from your conscious mind. It makes you hyperfocus on the faults in others, because viciously attacking their evil takes attention off of your own. Said another way: something within us _needs_ other people to be "bad," so that we can know ourselves as "good" by comparison. So we subconsciously behave in ways that _provoke_ evil under the guise of righteousness.

Think back to a time when you disobeyed your conscience, pretending either that you couldn't hear it or that you could safely ignore it. We've all done this. When this happens, a schism is created in your mind: part of you knows _perfectly well_ that you're doing wrong, but that knowledge is cleverly shielded from conscious self-reflection. It is then easy to convince others that you _don't_ know, because you have convinced _yourself_. **All evil relies on this mechanism of self-deception**. 

[//]: # (We see it easily in others, but in ourselves only when it's convenient to our self-image.)

Evil (almost) never _feels_ evil — or rather, even when it _does_ feel evil, the evil feels _right._ That's the most terrifying thing, and the hardest to describe. When I say that "evil feels right," you first imagine feeling evil — which triggers your "wrong" detector — and then think that only a "bad person" could feel this as "right." But that's not how it works. It feels _exactly_ like you do when you mock your enemies — but even _more_ obviously "good." That's because the worse a behavior is, the _harder_ your self-deception mechanism must work to cover it up. **If you cannot detect the "wrongness" in your mockery, you will not be able to detect it when you are committing atrocities, because your self-deception will have become infinitely stronger and more clever.**

I know this sounds preposterous. "Me? Committing _atrocities_? Just what do you take me for?" But the truth is that if you perceive your enemies as _evil enough_, your righteous instinct will _compel_ you to do everything in your power as a "good person" to stop them — and something within you is inexorably driving you toward seeing them as _impossibly evil._ Nobody _ever_ notices when they've "crossed the line," and it's impossibly arrogant to believe that you're special — _especially_ if you don't already (consciously) recognize what is being pointed out here.

It's not until _after_ you wake up from this self-induced trance that you discover just how badly you were fooling yourself. People were even trying to _warn_ you — but in that grotesque state, you couldn't see what they were pointing at. In fact, the harder they tried to show you, the more you perceived _them_ as evil, crazy, or stupid — which only deepened your self-deceptive trance. But most horrifically of all, you will discover that **some part of you always knew that you were doing wrong, even as you pretended not to**. By this point it is too late to make amends.

This is where the "bad people" find themselves. Something in them is shielding the _wrongness_ of their behavior from conscious self-reflection — and the more contemptuously you judge them for it, the more they will perceive _you_ as evil and dig in their heels. You will take this as confirmation of _their_ evil, but they are actually recognizing the same self-deceptive mechanism in you that is operating within them – the very thing you see as "evil." **This whole sordid dance was choreographed by the darkness in _both_ of your minds, to perpetuate itself without either of you catching on.** You both come away feeling more than justified.

Something within you _wants_ to push people further into the dark, but doesn't want to be caught doing so. This is malevolent. People can subconsciously sense this intention, and this by itself is enough to provoke the darkness in their minds. Mission accomplished; more darkness was created without you having to do anything provably evil. All it took was your dark motivation — something that you can trivially deny, even to yourself. It is this dark pattern that "good people" employ to maintain their self-image. _Genuinely_ good people are those who have learned to stop doing it. They _never_ look down on others, because this is the surest sign of brewing self-deception.

The reason that the "bad people" need to shield their misbehavior from consciousness is that _part of them doesn't want to be doing wrong._ This means that they are not _fundamentally_ defective. We perceive their badness as intrinsic only to justify our contempt, which in turn exists only to create more. You don't have to take my word for it, but can actually learn to perceive this. If you manage to take your own self-deception mechanism offline for even a moment, it feels exactly like you'd imagine feeling if you were suddenly freed from a demonic possession. You clearly perceive how this "demon" has very cleverly commandeered people's minds.

To be fair, there does seem to be a tiny percentage of people who have consciously welcomed the demon in, for whom the description "evil" really does capture something important. Such people pose a unique challenge. Being "kind" to them in the conventional sense can indeed be dangerous. And yet the very _deepest_ aspect of their mind does not want it. Again, it is only once you see exactly what "it" is that you understand why _nobody_ ultimately could. Think of it like a form of Stockholm syndrome. If you want to defeat evil, you must want them to be free of it, too.

When we meet (or even hear about) such people, we often experience the overwhelming urge to hate them, but this is the ultimate trap. It is their darkness inviting ours to treat them in a way that will drive them further into its clutches — and we very often take the bait. How could we not? It is like a gift-wrapped present: the opportunity to manifest our darkest tendencies in a way that we can convince ourselves and others is unmistakably _good._ 

Seeing this all clearly turns your whole world upside-down. We are hating people for their susceptibility to the world's most fiendish mind-virus — the one responsible for our very hatred. **Any time you feel contempt for _anyone_ for _any reason whatsoever_, your mind is secretly gearing up to elevate or otherwise enrich yourself at the world's expense.** We are all hypocrites, and contempt is _always_ a sign that your mind is hiding some hypocrisy from yourself.

Until this becomes _common knowledge_ (in the [technical sense](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/common-knowledge/) — where everyone knows that everyone knows that everyone knows...), humanity will continue to tie itself up in horrifying knots while pretending to be freeing itself from them. (This is exemplified by "pseudo-kind" ideologies, in which people claim to be helping one person or group by demonizing another. This *always* triggers a counter-ideology, and not by accident.) Unfortunately, our self-deception prevents us from making this _common knowledge_, no matter how clearly it is pointed out. This piece is an attempt.

What happens when your self-deception mechanism to "goes offline"? 

Your whole carefully-constructed reality — and the hierarchy of blame that scaffolds it — suddenly comes crashing down. The "great battles" that others are facing suddenly become obvious, as does your unfortunate role in having perpetuated them. It is impossible to communicate how painful the full epiphany is — to see what a hypocrite you've been; to be forcefully shown just how much of the world's darkness can be traced back to your own decisions to be unkind. But it's not all gloom and doom.

You then perceive your profound interconnectedness with the world. Malice, contempt, and self-righteousness are recognized as profoundly delusional. Seeing how confused people actually are, it is impossible to feel a trace of ill-will. You remember the sense in which you are not fundamentally better (or worse) than anyone, and why pretending that you are always makes the world darker. You feel boundless love for all of reality, recognizing your inseparability from every particle of it.

This perspective is not an altered state of consciousness, but something that is always there yet somehow curiously hidden. It feels like coming home to a place you never left. It is your deepest and most natural mode of knowing, which is how you will know that you can trust it.

---

There, you see that the root of the problem was the desire to be special; what the Buddhists call the _ego_. For those of us with a self-image as "good people," this manifests as the need to be _relatively_ good; i.e., good in comparison to others. This duality forces us to continually create "bad people" in all sorts of subtle ways that we can't consciously recognize. This process only comes to an end when we discover the _absolute_ good within.

This "absolute good" is something that we cannot take any credit for[^credit]. Instead, we can only feel profound gratitude for whatever grace allowed us to discover it, and heartbreak that it still remains so deeply hidden in others. The hardest part is watching the whole world being casually cruel to each other, unaware of which "team" they are secretly fighting for. It inspires a fierce determination to end the "possession" that has captured people's minds, instead of deepening it like we've unwittingly been doing. We clearly see the face of our true nemesis for the first time.

This doesn't mean that you will suddenly become nice or lovey-dovey toward evildoers. You may still need to be fierce, or perhaps even violent[^dalai-lama-gun]. Mockery, shaming, or even _apparent_ contempt might still be useful tools in your arsenal. But these will be in the service of _freeing_ people from the darkness, not pushing them further in. It is a kind of "tough love," and feels _nothing_ like the self-righteous antagonism that we normally feel when "fighting evil." You are still "connected to your heart." **That is what is most crucial.** Others can sense the profoundly benevolent intent (even if only subconsciously), and it makes _all the difference in the world_.

In every interaction you have two options: to either encourage the Light in others, or to fight their darkness with yours. **Encouraging their Light has nothing to do with being _nice_**. It is about being completely unwilling to abandon your own Light under _any circumstances_ — including the one that their darkness is presently testing you with. Their darkness is looking for a "hook" in your mind that it can use to justify itself — some sign that even you, the "good person," are weak to its seduction. If you refuse to abandon your integrity even then, the fierceness of your Light subjugates their darkness. They subconsciously remember that _the Light_ isn't just a myth.

This is authentic kindness (aka compassion). It is "radical" for two reasons. First, it contradicts our usual intuition that some people "deserve" it while others don't. It could never be the case that some people deserve to be shoved further into the abyss while others deserve to be freed from it. Second, it need not look anything like "kindness" in the conventional sense (though most often, it will). It certainly doesn't have to be soft or weak.

<p align="center" width="100%">
    <img width="300px" src="img/good-vs-bad.png"> 
</p>

I know it feels like some people don't _have_ an inner Light to encourage, but this is just an illusion that our darkness uses to get its foot in the door. By the time it has tricked us into dividing the world into fundamentally "good" and "bad" people — which feels like the most natural thing in the world — it has already infected the deepest aspect of our minds. Then, it can bide its time fostering conditions that will get us to commit unspeakable horror in the name of "good."[^genocide]

> _And no wonder, for even Satan masquerades as an angel of light._ —2 Corinthians 11:14

It is said that "the elites" are tricking us into hating each other to take attention off of themselves. Doesn't this make you hate them? Could it be that there is an even more subtle and wicked puppetmaster that is tricking us into hating _them_, so that we never discover _it_?

Indeed there is. No matter how much power the elites wield, it is _nothing_ compared to that of the dark entity pulling even their strings.

<p align="center" width="100%">
    <img width="300px" src="img/angel-devil-shoulders.png"> 
</p>

You know the classic image of the angel and devil sitting on our shoulders? It's _almost_ accurate, except for two things. First, the angel isn't external to you, but represents your intrinsically compassionate nature. Second, the devil _is_ extrinsic; it is a kind of parasite. But it doesn't just whisper obviously-bad ideas in your ear; it alters your very perception and pretends to _be_ your inner angel.

<p align="center" width="100%">
    <img width="300px" src="img/parasite.png"> 
</p>

It is this devil that tricks you into seeing other people as _fundamentally_ defective, instead of seeing that they are being manipulated by _their_ devils (which is something that your angel can always see). Our devils continually trigger each other — not because they are enemies, but _because they are allies_. Evil never actually fights evil; it only pretends to, to create more of itself.

<p align="center" width="100%">
    <img width="300px" src="img/shared-devil.png"> 
</p>

You know how people sometimes suspect that there's an "evil global conspiracy" lurking in the shadows, running the show behind the scenes? They are not crazy. They are subconsciously sensing something genuine: there is indeed an aspect of all of our minds communicating with itself beneath our conscious thresholds, shielding itself from discovery in _insanely_ clever ways. Its greatest trick is to prevent us from suspecting, let alone detecting, our own role in keeping it alive.

Our individual devils are working together almost like a single "distributed organism" — the _Devil_, if you will. Each of us suspects its existence, but we all view it from different angles. No two people fully agree on who's ultimately pulling the strings of the evil plot. The truth is that _nobody_ is — and _everybody_ is.

<p align="center" width="100%">
    <img width="300px" src="img/evil-above-world.png"> 
</p>

This "dark entity" continually drives humanity toward various kinds of Armageddon: situations in which everyone is violently expressing their own righteous fury to defeat the darkness "out there." It is why the US is headed toward civil war without anyone suspecting their own complicity, and explains bitter [divorces](https://www.gottman.com/blog/this-one-thing-is-the-biggest-predictor-of-divorce/) in which each side feels like the exclusive victim / hero. Nearly the whole world is caught in its terrible sway, evil provoking "righteous" retribution at every turn, without anyone ever noticing the true source of it all.

This is not just a wacky theory, or just a metaphor. As best I can tell, everyone who introspects carefully enough eventually discovers this. Something within your very mind is conspiring with the darkness in others to produce a kind of Hell on Earth. Every time you feel contempt for _anyone_, your "devil" is reaching out to give theirs a kind of secret handshake; a sinister agreement to keep this world bound in darkness. I have used the word "subconscious" to describe this activity, but that's not quite accurate. **It is completely accessible to consciousness, if you know how to look.** It is something you are _doing._ [The Devil hides in the last place you would ever look](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gg8JYYyWSPg); the innermost chamber of your mind.

It is impossible to overstate the shock of discovering, for the first time, that you have _always_ been in on the "evil global conspiracy." It is terrifying, heartbreaking, and humbling all at once. Every single act of unkindness we've ever perpetrated has been in the service of the Beast, even when we told ourselves that we had "good intentions." This includes not only being cruel to other people, but _all_ acts in which we skirt our conscience — such as when we "shave off a little extra" for ourselves at the expense of others, or take pleasure in others' suffering, or countless other "innocent" misbehaviors. Every time we do this, we are strengthening each other's demons.

To be clear: there are surely groups of particularly "endarkened" people who consciously conspire to cause great harm, and **we must hold such people accountable** — but when we do so with contempt, we are secretly (and on a subconscious level, _knowingly_) reinforcing the very conditions that effectively compel their existence. They cannot be defeated without our seeing this.

<p align="center" width="100%">
    <img width="300px" src="img/evil-conspiracy.png"> 
</p>

Ironically, we have no leg to stand on if we're still feeling self-righteous, because that is the surest sign that we are still under the demon's malevolent sway. This is precisely the opposite of what that emotion tells us — that the more we feel it, the more _free_ of evil we must surely be. It is actually impossible to fight evil from this place, because self-deception can only ever create more of itself.

Our true enemy is not other people, but the dark "entity" that has captured _all_ of our minds. By keeping our attention fixated perpetually outward, it ensures that we never introspect deeply enough to discover our own complicity in keeping it alive. We _must_ learn to perceive this.

We each have a crucial role to play in bringing down the "global conspiracy," and it begins by rediscovering our Light.

---

MLK once said:

> *Darkness cannot drive out darkness; only light can do that. Hate cannot drive out hate; only love can do that.*

These words are far wiser than we know. Ultimately, evil is not actually a _presence_ (like it seems), but an _absence_. The absence of what? Of the perception of the interconnectedness of all Life; of our fundamental equality with others. That this absence can behave so much like a presence — and an _intelligent_ one at that — is astonishing.

In a profound and surprising sense, [you _are_ the world](unity.md). Ultimately, all self-deception boils down to ignorance of this fact. This ignorance is not fully dispelled until _enlightenment_, but we can all sense it at all times. It is why certain literature speaks to us so loudly, and why we sometimes thank strangers for acts of charity that don't seem to benefit us directly. Part of us knows that what happens to the world ultimately happens to us. It is senseless to scorn people for not having realized this.

It is not possible to reduce the darkness in the world by withholding our own Light; by leveraging our contempt[^contempt], malice, hatred, etc. That is an insidious trap that we _must_ see through if humanity is to survive. Your Light is capable of accomplishing everything you think you need your darkness for, and much, much more — but there is a price that must be paid: you must give up the illusion of being special; of being fundamentally different from the "bad people." You must relinquish the sinister pleasure of watching harm come to your enemies. In brief, you must give up self-deception.

In exchange, you will discover the path toward the world you actually want in your deepest heart of hearts. It is well worth the price, and infinitely more.

Would you notice when _you_ crossed the line? You probably believe that you would, but it's not so simple. The way your devil works is by finding steps that are too small for you to waste time questioning them. And after you've taken a step, your mind always justifies it, to maintain your sanity. After taking 1000 such baby steps, somewhere you will have "crossed the line" — but the truth is that the very first step already crossed the only line that matters: the one where you went from following what you know to be right in your heart of hearts; your conscience, to following what your mind tells you is right; "justifications"; your devil. Don't ever take that first step away from your Heart. It is already evil.)


## Footnotes

[^contempt]: Specifically, we mean (genuine) contempt for *people*. Contempt for ideas or behaviors can actually be healthy, as perhaps can (apparent) contempt that is rooted in genuine compassion.

[^credit]: In fact, taking credit for it is one way to be sure that we haven't found "it."

[^dalai-lama-gun]: The Dalai Lama was once asked what you should do if a gunman is trying to shoot you and you have a gun. [He said "shoot back."](https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/dalai-gun/)

[^genocide]: This is how genocides happen. The Nazis referred to Jews as 'vermin,' and during the genocide in Rwanda, Tutsis were referred to as 'cockroaches.' This is a common pattern throughout history. Perhaps paradoxically, the only way to be sure that you'd never do such a thing is that you don't feel contempt for the people who have.

Take a moment to reflect on what's wrong with the world, and bring to mind the people responsible. Don't they seem _fundamentally morally defective_? Do you feel contempt for them, or maybe even malice? It feels like those emotions are there to help you _fight_ evil, but this is a sinister lie.

Something within you _wants_ to push people further into the dark, but doesn't want to be caught doing so. This is malevolent. People can subconsciously sense this intention, and this by itself is enough to provoke the darkness in their minds. Mission accomplished; more darkness was created without you having to do anything provably evil. All it took was your dark motivation — something that you can trivially deny, even to yourself. It is this dark pattern that "good people" employ to maintain their self-image. _Genuinely_ good people are those who have learned to stop doing it. They _never_ look down on others, because this is the surest sign of brewing self-deception.

The reason that the "bad people" need to shield their misbehavior from consciousness is that _part of them doesn't want to be doing wrong._ This means that they are not _fundamentally_ defective. We perceive their badness as intrinsic only to justify our contempt, which in turn exists only to create more. You don't have to take my word for it, but can actually learn to perceive this. If you manage to take your own self-deception mechanism offline for even a moment, it feels exactly like you'd imagine feeling if you were suddenly freed from a demonic possession. You clearly perceive how this "demon" has very cleverly commandeered people's minds.

To be fair, there does seem to be a tiny percentage of people who have consciously welcomed the demon in, for whom the description "evil" really does capture something important. Such people pose a unique challenge. Being "kind" to them in the conventional sense can indeed be dangerous. And yet the very _deepest_ aspect of their mind does not want it. Again, it is only once you see exactly what "it" is that you understand why _nobody_ ultimately could. Think of it like a form of Stockholm syndrome. If you want to defeat evil, you must want them to be free of it, too.

When we meet (or even hear about) such people, we often experience the overwhelming urge to hate them, but this is the ultimate trap. It is their darkness inviting ours to treat them in a way that will drive them further into its clutches — and we very often take the bait. How could we not? It is like a gift-wrapped present: the opportunity to manifest our darkest tendencies in a way that we can convince ourselves and others is unmistakably _good._ 

Seeing this all clearly turns your whole world upside-down. We are hating people for their susceptibility to the world's most fiendish mind-virus — the one responsible for our very hatred. **Any time you feel contempt for _anyone_ for _any reason whatsoever_, your mind is secretly gearing up to elevate or otherwise enrich yourself at the world's expense.** We are all hypocrites, and contempt is _always_ a sign that your mind is hiding some hypocrisy from yourself.

Until this becomes _common knowledge_ (in the [technical sense](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/common-knowledge/) — where everyone knows that everyone knows that everyone knows...), humanity will continue to tie itself up in horrifying knots while pretending to be freeing itself from them. (This is exemplified by "pseudo-kind" ideologies, in which people claim to be helping one person or group by demonizing another. This *always* triggers a counter-ideology, and not by accident.) Unfortunately, our self-deception prevents us from making this _common knowledge_, no matter how clearly it is pointed out. This piece is an attempt.

What happens when your self-deception mechanism to "goes offline"? 

Your whole carefully-constructed reality — and the hierarchy of blame that scaffolds it — suddenly comes crashing down. The "great battles" that others are facing suddenly become obvious, as does your unfortunate role in having perpetuated them. It is impossible to communicate how painful the full epiphany is — to see what a hypocrite you've been; to be forcefully shown just how much of the world's darkness can be traced back to your own decisions to be unkind. But it's not all gloom and doom.

You then perceive your profound interconnectedness with the world. Malice, contempt, and self-righteousness are recognized as profoundly delusional. Seeing how confused people actually are, it is impossible to feel a trace of ill-will. You remember the sense in which you are not fundamentally better (or worse) than anyone, and why pretending that you are always makes the world darker. You feel boundless love for all of reality, recognizing your inseparability from every particle of it.

This perspective is not an altered state of consciousness, but something that is always there yet somehow curiously hidden. It feels like coming home to a place you never left. It is your deepest and most natural mode of knowing, which is how you will know that you can trust it.

There, you see that the root of the problem was the desire to be special; what the Buddhists call the _ego_. For those of us with a self-image as "good people," this manifests as the need to be _relatively_ good; i.e., good in comparison to others. This duality forces us to continually create "bad people" in all sorts of subtle ways that we can't consciously recognize. This process only comes to an end when we discover the _absolute_ good within.

This "absolute good" is something that we cannot take any credit for[^credit]. Instead, we can only feel profound gratitude for whatever grace allowed us to discover it, and heartbreak that it still remains so deeply hidden in others. The hardest part is watching the whole world being casually cruel to each other, unaware of which "team" they are secretly fighting for. It inspires a fierce determination to end the "possession" that has captured people's minds, instead of deepening it like we've unwittingly been doing. We clearly see the face of our true nemesis for the first time.

This doesn't mean that you will suddenly become nice or lovey-dovey toward evildoers. You may still need to be fierce, or perhaps even violent[^dalai-lama-gun]. Mockery, shaming, or even _apparent_ contempt might still be useful tools in your arsenal. But these will be in the service of _freeing_ people from the darkness, not pushing them further in. It is a kind of "tough love," and feels _nothing_ like the self-righteous antagonism that we normally feel when "fighting evil." You are still "connected to your heart." **That is what is most crucial.** Others can sense the profoundly benevolent intent (even if only subconsciously), and it makes _all the difference in the world_.

In every interaction you have two options: to either encourage the Light in others, or to fight their darkness with yours. **Encouraging their Light has nothing to do with being _nice_**. It is about being completely unwilling to abandon your own Light under _any circumstances_ — including the one that their darkness is presently testing you with. Their darkness is looking for a "hook" in your mind that it can use to justify itself — some sign that even you, the "good person," are weak to its seduction. If you refuse to abandon your integrity even then, the fierceness of your Light subjugates their darkness. They subconsciously remember that _the Light_ isn't just a myth.

This is authentic kindness (aka compassion). It is "radical" for two reasons. First, it contradicts our usual intuition that some people "deserve" it while others don't. It could never be the case that some people deserve to be shoved further into the abyss while others deserve to be freed from it. Second, it need not look anything like "kindness" in the conventional sense (though most often, it will). It certainly doesn't have to be soft or weak.

</p>

I know it feels like some people don't _have_ an inner Light to encourage, but this is just an illusion that our darkness uses to get its foot in the door. By the time it has tricked us into dividing the world into fundamentally "good" and "bad" people — which feels like the most natural thing in the world — it has already infected the deepest aspect of our minds. Then, it can bide its time fostering conditions that will get us to commit unspeakable horror in the name of "good."[^genocide]

> _And no wonder, for even Satan masquerades as an angel of light._ —2 Corinthians 11:14

It is said that "the elites" are tricking us into hating each other to take attention off of themselves. Doesn't this make you hate them? Could it be that there is an even more subtle and wicked puppetmaster that is tricking us into hating _them_, so that we never discover _it_?

Indeed there is. No matter how much power the elites wield, it is _nothing_ compared to that of the dark entity pulling even their strings.

<p align="center" width="100%">
    <img width="300px" src="img/angel-devil-shoulders.png"> 
</p>

You know the classic image of the angel and devil sitting on our shoulders? It's _almost_ accurate, except for two things. First, the angel isn't external to you, but represents your intrinsically compassionate nature. Second, the devil _is_ extrinsic; it is a kind of parasite. But it doesn't just whisper obviously-bad ideas in your ear; it alters your very perception and pretends to _be_ your inner angel.

<p align="center" width="100%">
    <img width="300px" src="img/parasite.png"> 
</p>

It is this devil that tricks you into seeing other people as _fundamentally_ defective, instead of seeing that they are being manipulated by _their_ devils (which is something that your angel can always see). Our devils continually trigger each other — not because they are enemies, but _because they are allies_. Evil never actually fights evil; it only pretends to, to create more of itself.

<p align="center" width="100%">
    <img width="300px" src="img/shared-devil.png"> 
</p>

You know how people sometimes suspect that there's an "evil global conspiracy" lurking in the shadows, running the show behind the scenes? They are not crazy. They are subconsciously sensing something genuine: there is indeed an aspect of all of our minds communicating with itself beneath our conscious thresholds, shielding itself from discovery in _insanely_ clever ways. Its greatest trick is to prevent us from suspecting, let alone detecting, our own role in keeping it alive.

Our individual devils are working together almost like a single "distributed organism" — the _Devil_, if you will. Each of us suspects its existence, but we all view it from different angles. No two people fully agree on who's ultimately pulling the strings of the evil plot. The truth is that _nobody_ is — and _everybody_ is.

<p align="center" width="100%">
    <img width="300px" src="img/evil-above-world.png"> 
</p>

This "dark entity" continually drives humanity toward various kinds of Armageddon: situations in which everyone is violently expressing their own righteous fury to defeat the darkness "out there." It is why the US is headed toward civil war without anyone suspecting their own complicity, and explains bitter [divorces](https://www.gottman.com/blog/this-one-thing-is-the-biggest-predictor-of-divorce/) in which each side feels like the exclusive victim / hero. Nearly the whole world is caught in its terrible sway, evil provoking "righteous" retribution at every turn, without anyone ever noticing the true source of it all.

This is not just a wacky theory, or just a metaphor. As best I can tell, everyone who introspects carefully enough eventually discovers this. Something within your very mind is conspiring with the darkness in others to produce a kind of Hell on Earth. Every time you feel contempt for _anyone_, your "devil" is reaching out to give theirs a kind of secret handshake; a sinister agreement to keep this world bound in darkness. I have used the word "subconscious" to describe this activity, but that's not quite accurate. **It is completely accessible to consciousness, if you know how to look.** It is something you are _doing._ [The Devil hides in the last place you would ever look](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gg8JYYyWSPg); the innermost chamber of your mind.

It is impossible to overstate the shock of discovering, for the first time, that you have _always_ been in on the "evil global conspiracy." It is terrifying, heartbreaking, and humbling all at once. Every single act of unkindness we've ever perpetrated has been in the service of the Beast, even when we told ourselves that we had "good intentions." This includes not only being cruel to other people, but _all_ acts in which we skirt our conscience — such as when we "shave off a little extra" for ourselves at the expense of others, or take pleasure in others' suffering, or countless other "innocent" misbehaviors. Every time we do this, we are strengthening each other's demons.

To be clear: there are surely groups of particularly "endarkened" people who consciously conspire to cause great harm, and **we must hold such people accountable** — but when we do so with contempt, we are secretly (and on a subconscious level, _knowingly_) reinforcing the very conditions that effectively compel their existence. They cannot be defeated without our seeing this.

<p align="center" width="100%">
    <img width="300px" src="img/evil-conspiracy.png"> 
</p>

Ironically, we have no leg to stand on if we're still feeling self-righteous, because that is the surest sign that we are still under the demon's malevolent sway. This is precisely the opposite of what that emotion tells us — that the more we feel it, the more _free_ of evil we must surely be. It is actually impossible to fight evil from this place, because self-deception can only ever create more of itself.

Our true enemy is not other people, but the dark "entity" that has captured _all_ of our minds. By keeping our attention fixated perpetually outward, it ensures that we never introspect deeply enough to discover our own complicity in keeping it alive. We _must_ learn to perceive this.

We each have a crucial role to play in bringing down the "global conspiracy," and it begins by rediscovering our Light.

MLK once said:

> *Darkness cannot drive out darkness; only light can do that. Hate cannot drive out hate; only love can do that.*

These words are far wiser than we know. Ultimately, evil is not actually a _presence_ (like it seems), but an _absence_. The absence of what? Of the perception of the interconnectedness of all Life; of our fundamental equality with others. That this absence can behave so much like a presence — and an _intelligent_ one at that — is astonishing.

In a profound and surprising sense, [you _are_ the world](unity.md). Ultimately, all self-deception boils down to ignorance of this fact. This ignorance is not fully dispelled until _enlightenment_, but we can all sense it at all times. It is why certain literature speaks to us so loudly, and why we sometimes thank strangers for acts of charity that don't seem to benefit us directly. Part of us knows that what happens to the world ultimately happens to us. It is senseless to scorn people for not having realized this.

It is not possible to reduce the darkness in the world by withholding our own Light; by leveraging our contempt[^contempt], malice, hatred, etc. That is an insidious trap that we _must_ see through if humanity is to survive. Your Light is capable of accomplishing everything you think you need your darkness for, and much, much more — but there is a price that must be paid: you must give up the illusion of being special; of being fundamentally different from the "bad people." You must relinquish the sinister pleasure of watching harm come to your enemies. In brief, you must give up self-deception.

In exchange, you will discover the path toward the world you actually want in your deepest heart of hearts. It is well worth the price, and infinitely more.

## Addendum

(TODO)

- Compassion doesn't mean you know what the most beneficial behavior _is_; it merely ensures that you are not falling into the many seductive traps of your darkness. Determining the most effective behavior requires _wisdom_, which is a vast topic, and beyond the scope of this work. Compassion may be no easier to acquire than wisdom, but it is much simpler: there is a single place within your mind that you can turn to and _know_ whether you are allying with the darkness or the Light.


- "Outrage" can mean (healthy) anger directed at correcting an injustice, but it quickly gets corrupted into self-righteous indignation. Similarly, "judgement" can refer to wise discernment, but it quickly devolves into disdain. Just like "compassion" doesn't really mean "being nice," these words get redefined by our evil so that we make a mess of what is actually quite simple.

Would you notice when _you_ crossed the line? You probably believe that you would, but it's not so simple. The way your devil works is by finding steps that are too small for you to waste time questioning them. And after you've taken a step, your mind always justifies it, to maintain your sanity. After taking 1000 such baby steps, somewhere you will have "crossed the line" — but the truth is that the very first step already crossed the only line that matters: the one where you went from following what you know to be right in your heart of hearts; your conscience, to following what your mind tells you is right; "justifications"; your devil. Don't ever take that first step away from your Heart. It is already evil.)


## Footnotes

[^contempt]: Specifically, we mean (genuine) contempt for *people*. Contempt for ideas or behaviors can actually be healthy, as perhaps can (apparent) contempt that is rooted in genuine compassion.

[^credit]: In fact, taking credit for it is one way to be sure that we haven't found "it."

[^dalai-lama-gun]: The Dalai Lama was once asked what you should do if a gunman is trying to shoot you and you have a gun. [He said "shoot back."](https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/dalai-gun/)

[^genocide]: This is how genocides happen. The Nazis referred to Jews as 'vermin,' and during the genocide in Rwanda, Tutsis were referred to as 'cockroaches.' This is a common pattern throughout history. Perhaps paradoxically, the only way to be sure that you'd never do such a thing is that you don't feel contempt for the people who have.

What if nearly everything you're doing to "fight evil" is actually strengthening it — and moreover, what if part of you already knows this but is actively concealing it from your conscious mind? 

There's an insidious mechanism within our minds that prevents us from consciously confronting the full implications of our behavior. It is only once we see this that we begin to understand the secret mechanism behind _all_ evil. Until then, we have no hope of defeating it. We can only amplify it.

The Devil hides in the very last place you would ever look.

Take a moment to reflect on what's wrong with the world, and bring to mind the people responsible. Don't they seem not only morally defective, but somehow _fundamentally_ so? Do you feel contempt for them, or maybe even malice? Such people cannot be fixed; they can only be subdued or punished. It feels like the contempt is there to help us accomplish those goals and thereby improve the world, but this is a sinister lie. It exists only to shield you from something your subconscious is secretly doing: preparing to justify behaviors that will elevate or otherwise enrich you at the world's expense — and make you feel _righteous_ about it.

This is not something I can convince you of, so I won't even try. But here's the thing: part of you already knows it. You don't enjoy mocking or shaming your enemies to help them (or anyone else) "see the light," or to make the world a better place. You do it to make yourself feel superior. It may temporarily suppress their misbehavior (in public, anyway), but it _will_ increase the net hostility and polarization in the world. You may tell yourself that it won't, or that it's their fault if it does, or that the benefits outweigh the drawbacks, but part of you knows that these are just lame excuses for malicious behavior.

To be clear, it's not that shame and mockery can't be helpful. They probably can — but when they're motivated by contempt, a deep part of us isn't actually _trying_ to help. It has a much darker goal in mind, and is actively shielding you from consciously recognizing this. Why?

A deep aspect of our minds _needs_ to see ourselves as special. For some people this may be about accumulating wealth, and in others it is about being "good people." This aspect makes us perceive other people in whatever way necessary to justify behavior that will bolster our self-image. For "good people," our subconscious is on the prowl for anyone we can plausibly see as "bad," and who we can then _make worse_ — but only via behaviors that appear righteous on the surface.

Of course, you will not (consciously) recognize that you're doing this — but other people can. If they are compassionate and wise, they will sense whatever "great battle" you are internally fighting that is driving this misbehavior, and will help heal it. If they are especially skilled, you won't even know that they're doing this. Their behavior may appear fierce and antagonistic, and look nothing like "compassion" — but you will subconsciously sense that they are not truly enemies.

If they are _not_ compassionate — which is to say, if they are not yet aware of the same dark tendency in themselves that they are violently accusing you of — then they will treat you with contempt. Far from helping you recognize your misbehavior, this will force your subconscious to mask it even harder. This is exactly what their darkness wants: to make you a slightly worse person, so that their contempt is validated, and their realm of "justified behaviors" grows.

---

Your _conscience_ (not to be confused with your _consciousness_) is that part of you that most deeply knows right from wrong. It doesn't always give you such a clear signal, but even when it does, you can choose to override it. We've all done this. These are the justifications we use to convince ourselves that certain behaviors are okay even when we deep down know they're not.

The more we disobey our conscience, the harder it becomes to hear. Its signal very quickly becomes lost in the noise of our minds, and we easily confuse our justifications for its voice. It's not that it has become _quieter_, per se. It is always right there, if we bother to look. But we train ourselves _not_ to look — again, because there is some competing drive that is competing for priority. 

Everyone lies somewhere along this spectrum of self-deception. We like to think that the people who are further along than we are are somehow fundamentally morally inferior to us — and therefore worthy of our contempt — but this is exactly the lie. We believe this _only_ so that we can feel good about pushing them further in, thereby increasing our apparent intrinsic difference.

It is true that they've for some reason _chosen_ to ignore their conscience — and therefore need to be corrected — but it's _also_ true that some tiny part of them doesn't want to be doing this. The choice you face in confronting them is to do the hard work of finding that "tiny" part of them and helping it join the fight against their darkness, or to take the easy route and push it further into the abyss for your own glorification. For the most part, humanity has been going full-throttle on the second approach.

As a civilization, we are _pretending_ to be fighting evil, but part of our minds knows that this is just a ruse for secret self-aggrandizement. Nothing will change until we become deeply aware of this.

I know it feels like some people don't _have_ an inner Light to encourage, but this is just an illusion that our darkness uses to get its foot in the door. By the time it has tricked us into dividing the world into fundamentally "good" and "bad" people — which feels like the most natural thing in the world — it has already infected the deepest aspect of our minds. Then, it can bide its time fostering conditions that will get us to commit unspeakable horror in the name of "good."[^genocide]

> _And no wonder, for even Satan masquerades as an angel of light._ —2 Corinthians 11:14

It is said that "the elites" are tricking us into hating each other to take attention off of themselves. Doesn't this make you hate them? Could it be that there is an even more subtle and wicked puppetmaster that is tricking us into hating _them_, so that we never discover _it_?

Indeed there is. No matter how much power the elites wield, it is _nothing_ compared to that of the dark entity pulling even their strings.

You know the classic image of the angel and devil sitting on our shoulders? It's _almost_ accurate, except for two things. First, the angel isn't external to you, but represents your intrinsically compassionate nature. Second, the devil _is_ extrinsic; it is a kind of parasite. But it doesn't just whisper obviously-bad ideas in your ear; it alters your very perception and pretends to _be_ your inner angel.

<p align="center" width="100%">
    <img width="300px" src="img/parasite.png"> 
</p>

It is this devil that tricks you into seeing other people as _fundamentally_ defective, instead of seeing that they are being manipulated by _their_ devils (which is something that your angel can always see). Our devils continually trigger each other — not because they are enemies, but _because they are allies_. Evil never actually fights evil; it only pretends to, to create more of itself.

<p align="center" width="100%">

</p>

You know how people sometimes suspect that there's an "evil global conspiracy" lurking in the shadows, secretly running the show behind the scenes? They are not crazy. They are subconsciously sensing something genuine: there is indeed an aspect of all of our minds communicating with itself beneath our conscious thresholds, shielding itself from discovery in _insanely_ clever ways. Its greatest trick is to prevent us from suspecting, let alone detecting, our own role in keeping it alive.

Our individual devils are working together almost like a single "distributed organism" — the _Devil_, if you will. Each of us suspects its existence, but we all view it from different angles. No two people fully agree on who's ultimately pulling the strings of the evil plot. The truth is that _nobody_ is — and _everybody_ is.

<p align="center" width="100%">
    <img width="300px" src="img/evil-above-world.png"> 
</p>

This "dark entity" continually drives humanity toward various kinds of Armageddon: situations in which everyone is violently proving how _good_ they are. It is why the US is headed toward civil war without anyone suspecting their own complicity, and explains bitter [divorces](https://www.gottman.com/blog/this-one-thing-is-the-biggest-predictor-of-divorce/) in which each side feels like the exclusive victim / hero. Nearly the whole world is caught in its terrible sway, evil provoking "righteous" retribution at every turn, without anyone ever noticing the true source of it all.

This is not just a wacky theory, or just a metaphor. As best I can tell, everyone who introspects carefully enough eventually discovers this. Something within your very mind is conspiring with the darkness in others to produce a kind of Hell on Earth. Every time you feel contempt for _anyone_, your "devil" is reaching out to give theirs a kind of secret handshake; a sinister agreement to keep this world bound in darkness. I have used the word "subconscious" to describe this activity, but that's not quite accurate. **It is completely accessible to consciousness, if you know how to look.** It is something you are _doing._ [The Devil hides in the last place you would ever look](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gg8JYYyWSPg); the innermost chamber of your mind.

It is impossible to overstate the shock of discovering, for the first time, that you have _always_ been in on the "evil global conspiracy." It is terrifying, heartbreaking, and humbling all at once. Every single act of unkindness we've ever perpetrated has been in the service of the Beast, even when we told ourselves that we had "good intentions." This includes not only being cruel to other people, but _all_ acts in which we skirt our conscience — such as when we "shave off a little extra" for ourselves at the expense of others, or take pleasure in others' suffering, or countless other "innocent" misbehaviors. Every time we do this, we are strengthening each other's demons.

To be clear: there are surely groups of particularly "endarkened" people who consciously conspire to cause great harm, and **we must hold such people accountable** — but when we do so with contempt, we are secretly (and on a subconscious level, _knowingly_) reinforcing the very conditions that effectively compel their existence. They cannot be defeated without our seeing this.

<p align="center" width="100%">
    <img width="300px" src="img/evil-conspiracy.png"> 
</p>

Ironically, we have no leg to stand on if we're still feeling self-righteous, because that is the surest sign that we are still under the demon's malevolent sway. This is precisely the opposite of what that emotion tells us — that the more we feel it, the more _free_ of evil we must surely be. It is actually impossible to fight evil from this place, because self-deception can only ever create more of itself.

Our true enemy is not other people, but the dark "entity" that has captured _all_ of our minds. By keeping our attention fixated perpetually outward, it ensures that we never introspect deeply enough to discover our own complicity in keeping it alive. We _must_ learn to perceive this.

We each have a crucial role to play in bringing down the "global conspiracy," and it begins by rediscovering our Light.

MLK once said:

> *Darkness cannot drive out darkness; only light can do that. Hate cannot drive out hate; only love can do that.*

These words are far wiser than we know. Ultimately, evil is not actually a _presence_ (like it seems), but an _absence_. The absence of what? Of the perception of the interconnectedness of all Life; of our fundamental equality with others. That this absence can behave so much like a presence — and an _intelligent_ one at that — is astonishing.

In a profound and surprising sense, [you _are_ the world](unity.md). Ultimately, all self-deception boils down to ignorance of this fact. This ignorance is not fully dispelled until _enlightenment_, but we can all sense it at all times. It is why certain literature speaks to us so loudly, and why we sometimes thank strangers for acts of charity that don't seem to benefit us directly. Part of us knows that what happens to the world ultimately happens to us. It is senseless to scorn people for not having realized this.

It is not possible to reduce the darkness in the world by withholding our own Light; by leveraging our contempt[^contempt], malice, hatred, etc. That is an insidious trap that we _must_ see through if humanity is to survive. Your Light is capable of accomplishing everything you think you need your darkness for, and much, much more — but there is a price that must be paid: you must give up the illusion of being special; of being fundamentally different from the "bad people." You must relinquish the sinister pleasure of watching harm come to your enemies. In brief, you must give up self-deception.

In exchange, you will discover the path toward the world you actually want in your deepest heart of hearts. It is well worth the price, and infinitely more.

## Addendum

(TODO)

- Compassion doesn't mean you know what the most beneficial behavior _is_; it merely ensures that you are not falling into the many seductive traps of your darkness. Determining the most effective behavior requires _wisdom_, which is a vast topic, and beyond the scope of this work. Compassion may be no easier to acquire than wisdom, but it is much simpler: there is a single place within your mind that you can turn to and _know_ whether you are allying with the darkness or the Light.


- "Outrage" can mean (healthy) anger directed at correcting an injustice, but it quickly gets corrupted into self-righteous indignation. Similarly, "judgement" can refer to wise discernment, but it quickly devolves into disdain. Just like "compassion" doesn't really mean "being nice," these words get redefined by our evil so that we make a mess of what is actually quite simple.

[//]: # (We _want_ people to believe that they're fundamentally broken.)

[//]: # (The most important thing needed in making a better world is freeing people from self-deception. We think that the greatest challenge is differences in opinions, but that's not true.)

[//]: # (Reveals empathy.)

[//]: # (How do people become evil? Do they just wake up one day and choose evil? Or do they slowly slide into it, not noticing when they've crossed the line? Would you notice when _you_ crossed the line? You probably believe that you would, but it's not so simple. The way your devil works is by finding steps that are too small for you to waste time questioning them. And after you've taken a step, your mind always justifies it, to maintain your sanity. After taking 1000 such baby steps, somewhere you will have "crossed the line" — but the truth is that the very first step already crossed the only line that matters: the one where you went from following what you know to be right in your heart of hearts; your conscience, to following what your mind tells you is right; "justifications"; your devil. Don't ever take that first step away from your Heart. It is already evil.)


## Footnotes

[^contempt]: Specifically, we mean (genuine) contempt for *people*. Contempt for ideas or behaviors can actually be healthy, as perhaps can (apparent) contempt that is rooted in genuine compassion.

[^credit]: In fact, taking credit for it is one way to be sure that we haven't found "it."

[^dalai-lama-gun]: The Dalai Lama was once asked what you should do if a gunman is trying to shoot you and you have a gun. [He said "shoot back."](https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/dalai-gun/)

[^genocide]: This is how genocides happen. The Nazis referred to Jews as 'vermin,' and during the genocide in Rwanda, Tutsis were referred to as 'cockroaches.' This is a common pattern throughout history. Perhaps paradoxically, the only way to be sure that you'd never do such a thing is that you don't feel contempt for the people who have.



[//]: # (The "bad people" know perfectly well that what they're doing is wrong, but that "wrongness" is very cleverly shielded from conscious self-reflection. Any "good" person should want to be _free_ them of this deception, not to compound it — and being free of self-deception themselves, they would perceive that contempt is the wrong way to go about this.)

[//]: # (Think back to a time when you disobeyed your conscience, pretending either that you couldn't hear it or that you could safely ignore it. We've all done this. When this happens, a schism is created in your mind: part of you knows _perfectly well_ that you're doing wrong, but that knowledge is cleverly shielded from conscious self-reflection. It is then easy to convince others that you _don't_ know, because you have convinced _yourself_. **All evil relies on this mechanism of self-deception**. We notice it easily in others, but in ourselves only when it's convenient to our self-image.)

[//]: # (This is what is happening in the "bad people.")

[//]: # (Evil never _feels_ evil — or rather, even when it _does_ feel evil, that evil feels _right._ That's the most terrifying thing, and the hardest to describe. The worse a behavior is, the _harder_ your self-deception will work to cover up the "wrongness." The greatest evils feel exactly like how you feel when mocking your enemies, but a thousand times more righteous. **If you cannot detect the "wrongness" in your mockery now, you will not be able to detect it when committing atrocities.** You may believe that your morals will alert you when you're crossing the line, but this is the greatest lie: you aren't currently listening to the part of you that actually knows right from wrong; you are listening to your _justifications_ — and every time you do, they grow more seductive.)

[//]: # (It's not until _after_ you wake up from this self-induced trance that you discover just how badly you were fooling yourself. People were even trying to _warn_ you — but in that grotesque state, you couldn't see what they were pointing at. In fact, the harder they tried, the more you perceived _them_ as evil, crazy, or stupid — which only deepened your self-deceptive trance. But most horrifically of all, you will discover that **some part of you always knew that you were doing wrong, even as you pretended not to**. By this point it is too late to make amends.)

[//]: # (Something within you _wants_ to push people further into the dark, but doesn't want to be caught doing so. This is malevolent. People can subconsciously sense this intention, and this by itself is enough to provoke the darkness in their minds. Mission accomplished; more darkness was created without you having to do anything provably evil. All it took was your dark motivation — something that you can trivially deny, even to yourself. It is this dark pattern that "good people" employ to maintain their self-image. _Genuinely_ good people don't behave that way. They _never_ look down on others, because this is the surest sign of self-deception.)

[//]: # (To be fair, there does seem to be a tiny percentage of people who have consciously welcomed the demon in, for whom the description "evil" really does capture something important. Such people pose a unique challenge. Being "kind" to them in the conventional sense can indeed be dangerous. And yet the very _deepest_ aspect of their mind does not want it. Again, it is only once you see exactly what "it" is that you understand why _nobody_ ultimately could. Think of it like a form of Stockholm syndrome. If you want to defeat evil, you must want them to be free of it, too.)

[//]: # (When we meet &#40;or even hear about&#41; such people, we often experience the overwhelming urge to hate them, but this is the ultimate trap. It is their darkness inviting ours to treat them in a way that will drive them further into its clutches — and we very often take the bait. How could we not? It is like a gift-wrapped present: the opportunity to manifest our darkest tendencies in a way that we can convince ourselves and others is unmistakably _good._ )

Why is it so hard to maintain our humanity in the face of evil? And why are we "supposed to" in the first place?

---

All misbehavior — from cutting in line to genuine atrocities — is ultimately enabled by a kind of parasite in the mind. Think of it as that devil on our shoulders. It doesn't just whisper obviously-evil ideas in our ears; no, it alters our very perception, so that it appears okay (or even _righteous_) to step on certain people. It shields us from confronting the full implications of our words and behaviors.

The "bad people" know perfectly well when what they are doing is wrong, but that knowledge is very cleverly hidden from conscious self-reflection. If you try to viciously force them to confront it, it just drives the parasite deeper into their minds. But something in you already knows this.

When _you_ are in a state of self-deception — and we've all been there — you do not tolerate contempt from others. It makes you see them as _bad people_ who need to be put in _their_ place. It helps justify your self-deception — and makes you respond in a way that helps them justify theirs. This isn't an accident.

Our parasites are _collaborating_ — and contempt is the secret tool they use to communicate, beneath our conscious thresholds. Our contempt telegraphs to others that our mind is in that dark space, subconsciously plotting to elevate or otherwise enrich ourselves at the world's expense — and it invites them to do the same, whether they are nominally friends or enemies.

We treat the "bad people" with contempt to help ourselves feel superior; to further distance ourselves and prove that we're nothing alike. Unfortunately, it is the surest sign that we _are._ We are shoving people deeper into the abyss and calling it "righteous." Rather than admit it, our minds hide this horrible truth by doubling down on our self-deception, so that we never suspect it.

We maintain a dividing line between the "fundamentally" good and bad; those who deserve our compassion and those who deserve our contempt. That boundary sometimes grows, as when we first discover that "hurt people hurt people." But the maintenance of _any division at all_ indicates that our "devil" still has its foot in the door. The line exists only to justify its continued presence.

<p align="center" width="100%">
    <img width="300px" src="img/shared-devil.png"> 
</p>

If you look carefully enough, you will discover that our devils together behave more like a single malevolent distributed entity — the _Devil_, if you will. It is that archetypal "evil conspiracy" that we subconsciously fear exists — the one to which all the rest ultimately owe their existence, and to which they all ultimately report — _and every one of us is secretly in on it_. It remains hidden by keeping our attention fixated perpetually outward, blinding us to our own complicity.

Every time we feel malice, contempt, or self-righteousness; any time we are unkind to anyone for any reason, we are secretly feeding the Beast. Every act of unkindness ripples through its terrible body, lowering the threshold for more acts of evil to erupt in faraway locations — for which we will feel absolutely no complicity. But part of us always knows. This is what we must make conscious.

To be clear: there are surely groups of particularly "endarkened" people who consciously conspire to cause great harm, and **we must hold such people accountable**. But when it is motivated by contempt, we are reinforcing the very conditions that effectively _compel_ their existence — and a deep part of us knows this. It is as though the left hand does not know what the right is doing.

Nobody ultimately _wants_ to be under the sway of their devil — the key word being "ultimately." There are certainly people who willingly harbor it; those whom we classically think of as "evil." It would be foolish to be "kind" to them in the _conventional_ sense. Yet it is far _more_ foolish to feel malice, because that is **exactly** what their demon wants — and it is also where it is hardest to detect our own self-deception, and the easiest to justify it to others. It is the ultimate trap.

The more you unearth your own demon, the more clearly you see that such people are suffering from a kind of Stockholm syndrome — and the more obvious it becomes that  driving them toward their captor is malevolent. You are smothering what little light is left. It is literally the _worst_ time to be unkind. Unconventional means may be necessary to deal with them, but unkindness never is. If you believe that they _have_ no light, consider that this may be exactly the "trap" I described.

**True kindness is not about being _nice._** It can be fierce or even [violent](https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/dalai-gun/) if necessary. It is only about being lucidly aware of your own capacity to fall into self-deception, and refusing to do so. It is about staying connected to your Heart; that part of you that remembers the Truth — the very thing that your parasite is trying to make you forget. **Your fight is with the parasite. Hating the host just strengthens it.** Only your Light can bring about the better world you most deeply desire. The more you remember this, the more your very being helps others remember.

It helps justify your self-deception — and encourages you to respond in a way that helps them justify theirs. This isn't an accident.

If you introspect deeply enough into your mind — and this can be hard — you will discover that something in you is _eager_ to shove "bad people"'s mind deeper into the abyss. You can subconsciously perceive that they are in the grip of a terrible demon that we ourselves share — indeed, that is controlling our mind _at this very moment_ — and the similarity horrifies you. The further you can push them into its grip, the more they will appear to be _fundamentally defective_, and thus unlike you.

This actually creates _new_ evil, but it doesn't feel like that. It feels like we are zeroing in on existing evil; exposing or distilling the hidden evil that is already there. It is as though we have finally caught a hold of the source of darkness in the world, and we can finally _punish_ it.

> _And no wonder, for even Satan masquerades as an angel of light. So it is not strange that his ministers also masquerade as ministers of righteousness._ —2 Corinthians 11:14-16
 
This is a smokescreen created by your devil. It knows perfectly well that this will bring more darkness. In fact, that is its whole game. But it must never let you know this, and so it hides this behind _astonishingly_ seductive justifications that you don't even realize are seductions. All you consciously feel is "I'm fighting evil," and you have all the evidence to prove it.

Under the covers, their devil reached out to yours to offer it a secret handshake — and contempt was sign of your acceptance. No matter how well we try to mask this, people can subconsciously sense it. It invites everyone — ally and enemy alike — into that dark space of mind with us. What goes on in there isn't pretty.

But when we do so with contempt, we are reinforcing the very conditions that effectively _compel_ their existence — and a deep part of us knows this.

So far I have been calling this all "subconscious," but that's not entirely accurate. The greatest shock is discovering that it was somehow _always_ accessible to consciousness, if we'd just bothered to look. This isn't a judgement of us. We really _want_ to look, but something is stopping us. Our job is to discover whatever that is.

Nobody ultimately _wants_ to be under the sway of their devil — the key word being "ultimately." There are certainly people who willingly harbor it; those whom we classically think of as "evil."

This allows us to feel superior, in a way that can plausibly be defended as righteous. We are only _fighting evil,_ after all.

We maintain a dividing line between the "fundamentally" good and bad; those who deserve our compassion and those who deserve our contempt. That boundary changes throughout life, as we develop increasing empathy. But the maintenance of _any division at all_ indicates that our "devil" still has its foot in the door. The line exists only to justify its continued presence.

The short answer to "why show evildoers compassion?" is that the only alternative is to be evil.

Why is it so hard to maintain our humanity in the face of evil? And why are we "supposed to" in the first place?

---

All misbehavior — from cutting in line to genuine atrocities — is ultimately enabled by a kind of parasite in the mind. Think of it as that devil on our shoulders. But this devil doesn't just whisper obviously-evil ideas in our ears; no, it alters our very perception, so that it appears okay — or even _righteous_ — to step on certain people. It shields us from confronting the full implications of our words and behaviors.

The "bad people" know perfectly well when what they are doing is wrong, but that knowledge is very cleverly hidden from conscious self-reflection. If you try to viciously force them to confront it, it just drives the parasite deeper into their minds. But something in you already knows this.

When _you_ are in a state of self-deception — and we've all been there — you do not tolerate contemptuous judgement from others. Why? Because it signals to you that _they_ are in a state of self-deception and are in no position to be judging you. You see them as _bad people_ who need to be put in _their_ place, and feel _even more_ licensed to do whatever you need to do — which in turn convinces them that they were right about you all along. It is the contempt that drives this outcome, not the mere judgement (in the sense of _wise discernment_).

The same is true when the positions are reversed. Self-righteous outrage feels damn good — i.e., both enjoyable and virtuous — and yet something in you knows that it will just make them dig in their heels. In fact, that part of you _wants_ this, because it helps you prove just how _bad_ they are; how totally unlike you. But there's one small problem.

Subconsciously, you can perceive that they are actually in the grip of a terrible demon that you yourself share — indeed, one that is controlling your mind _at this very moment_ — and this similarity horrifies you. You shove them deeper into the abyss to hide this fact from yourself — because the deeper they go, the easier it gets to perceive them as _fundamentally_ defective, and not as a fellow human who badly needs help. (Indeed, beyond a certain point, even _they_ cannot consciously perceive this of themselves. At that point, who can really blame us?)

This actually creates _new_ evil, but it doesn't feel like that. It feels like you are zeroing in on existing evil; exposing or distilling the hidden evil that is already there. It is as though you are finally catching a hold of the source of darkness in the world, and are finally _punishing_ it.

> _And no wonder, for even Satan masquerades as an angel of light. So it is not strange that his ministers also masquerade as ministers of righteousness._ —2 Corinthians 11:14-16
 
This is all a smokescreen created by your devil. It knows perfectly well that this behavior darkens the world. In fact, that is its whole game. But it must never let you know this, and so it hides this behind _astonishingly_ seductive justifications that you don't even realize are seductions. All you consciously feel is "I'm fighting evil" — and you have all the evidence to prove it.

What "actually" happened was that under the covers, their devil reached out to yours to offer it a secret handshake — and you signaled agreement by generating contempt. _Contempt is the secret tool by which our devils coordinate, beneath our conscious thresholds._ No matter how carefully you disguise it — even from yourself — it always leaks out into the world.

<p align="center" width="100%">
    <img width="300px" src="img/shared-devil.png"> 
</p>

If you look carefully, you will discover that our devils together behave more like a single malevolent distributed entity — the _Devil_, if you will. It is that archetypal "evil conspiracy" that we subconsciously fear exists — the one to which all the rest ultimately owe their existence, and to which they all ultimately report — _and every one of us is secretly in on it_. It remains hidden by keeping our attention fixated perpetually outward, blinding us to our own participation.

Every time we feel malice, contempt, or self-righteousness; any time we are unkind to anyone for any reason, we are secretly feeding the Beast. Every act of unkindness ripples through its terrible body, lowering the threshold for more acts of evil to erupt in faraway locations — for which we will feel absolutely no complicity. But part of us always knows.

To be clear, we're certainly not all equally complicit. There are surely groups of particularly "endarkened" people who consciously conspire to cause great harm, and **we must hold such people accountable**. But when we do so with contempt, we are reinforcing the very conditions that effectively _compel_ their existence — and a deep part of us knows this.

So far I have been calling this all "subconscious," but that's not entirely accurate. The greatest shock is discovering that it was somehow _always_ accessible to consciousness, if we'd just bothered to look. This isn't a judgement of us. We _want_ to look, but something keeps stopping us. Our duty is to discover whatever that is, and heal it.

Nobody ultimately _wants_ to be under the sway of their devil — the key word being "ultimately." There are certainly people who willingly harbor it; those whom we classically think of as "evil." It would be foolish to be "kind" to them in the _conventional_ sense. Yet it is far _more_ foolish to feel malice, because that is **exactly** what their demon wants — and it is also where it is hardest to detect our own self-deception, and the easiest to justify it to others. It is the ultimate trap.

The more you unearth your own demon, the more clearly you see that such people are suffering from a kind of Stockholm syndrome — and the more acutely you feel the malevolence of driving them toward their captor. It smothers what little light is left. (If you believe that they _have_ no light, consider that this may be exactly the "trap" I just described.) It is literally the _worst_ time to be unkind. Unconventional means may be necessary to deal with them, but unkindness never is. This could only be true if "kindness" does not mean what we usually think.

**True kindness is not about being _nice._** It can be fierce or even [violent](https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/dalai-gun/) if necessary. It only requires being lucidly aware of your own capacity for self-deception, and refusing to fall into it. It is about staying connected to your Heart; that part of you that remembers the Truth — the very thing that your parasite is lulling you into forgetting. **Your fight is with the parasite. Hating the host just strengthens it.** 

The more you remember this, the more your very way of being inspires others to remember. Then, bit by bit you notice that even "evil" has no fundamental essence; that it is not a thing that can be "fought." It is not a _presence_, but an _absence._ An absence of what? Of the perception of our deep interconnectedness and fundamental equality. Hating people for not yet perceiving this makes no sense. Only your Light can bring about the better world you most deeply desire — and only you know what form your Light must take to make that happen.

There is an aspect within each person's mind that genuinely wants what's best for the world. Sometimes, it is extremely well hidden — as with the "evil people." But it is always there, even when they themselves are not aware of it. To the degree that you can perceive it in others, you can help empower it. This is _kindness_, and it comes from the part of _you_ that only ever wants what's best for the world. It doesn't mean being _nice._ Sometimes the kindest behavior is the opposite of nice.

There is also an aspect within each of us that blocks us from seeing this aspect of others, and even ourselves. In fact, what is blocking you from perceiving it in "bad people" is precisely the same thing that enables their bad behavior in the first place. It is also what allows us to be casually cruel or cold to people we barely know (but may _think_ we know), telling ourselves that we're helping. It is an illusion that we must see through if we are to survive.

It is about staying connected to your Heart; that part of you that remembers the Truth — the very thing that your parasite is lulling you into forgetting. **Your fight is with the parasite. Hating the host just strengthens it.** 

The more you remember this, the more your very way of being inspires others to remember. Then, bit by bit you notice that even "evil" has no fundamental essence; that it is not a thing that can be "fought." It is not a _presence_, but an _absence._ An absence of what? Of the perception of our deep interconnectedness and fundamental equality. Hating people for not yet perceiving this makes no sense. Only your Light can bring about the better world you most deeply desire — and only you know what form your Light must take to make that happen.

Our true nemesis is never other people, despite obvious appearance to the contrary. It is the delusion that has ensnared all of our minds. The more we come to recognize just how badly it has fooled us, the more we appreciate what the "bad people" are really up against, and the more we can be of genuine service in dispelling it. We each have a role to play, and it always begins with us.

This allows us to feel superior, in a way that can plausibly be defended as righteous. We are only _fighting evil,_ after all.

We maintain a dividing line between the "fundamentally" good and bad; those who deserve our compassion and those who deserve our contempt. That boundary changes throughout life, as we develop increasing empathy. But the maintenance of _any division at all_ indicates that our "devil" still has its foot in the door. The line exists only to justify its continued presence.

The short answer to "why show evildoers compassion?" is that the only alternative is to be evil.

We think that hating "bad people" is a sign of the good within us, but it's actually a sign of something much darker.

"Bad people" are only able to do what they do thanks to a kind of self-deception that makes harming other people feel okay. The deepest part of them knows perfectly well that what they are doing is wrong, but that knowledge is carefully shielded from conscious self-reflection. It is often so well-shielded that it is impossible for us to believe that it exists at all — but it does.

Exactly the same mechanism lives within our very own minds, though we rarely recognize it. It is what allows us to mock our political opponents with glee. We tell ourselves that they deserve it, and that it is making the world a better place — and we _believe_ this with all our hearts. Except it's not really with _all_ our hearts. The very deepest part of us always knows better, but we carefully shield this knowledge from conscious self-reflection.

It's easy to get lost in speculation about whether such behavior is actually a net harm or good, especially because we don't get to see all of its downstream effects. Even if we do see the second-, third-, etc. order effects — like a humiliated father venting his frustration on his children, who then grow up to become "bad people" themselves — we never make the connection back to our own behavior. And even if by some miracle we do, it is easy to avoid feeling any complicity. Sure, we may have provoked him, but it was _his_ responsibility to handle it with grace. Why didn't he just become a _better person_, like we so clearly intended?

Instead of getting lost in such speculation, there's something else you can do. If you inspect your mind carefully enough during such speculation, you'll discover that it exists primarily to hide something that your subconscious mind is secretly doing from your consciousness.

You see, part of us actually _wants_ "bad people" to become worse. Why? Because this enables us to feel like _better people_ by comparison. But this is extremely hard to admit to ourselves. So our mind finds _exceedingly_ clever ways to push them further into the dark in ways that we can label "righteous." When executed well — which is most of the time — you will never even suspect that you're doing this. The very idea will sound offensively absurd. And if anyone tries to point it out, powerful defense mechanisms will kick in, making it even harder to see — especially if they do it with even a trace of contempt (for reasons we shall soon see).

The truth is that any time you are unkind; any time you feel contempt, malice, or self-righteousness toward _anyone_ for _any reason_; it is your ego operating, attempting to elevate or otherwise enrich yourself at the world's expense. It is _precisely_ the same mechanism that allows the "bad people" to do what they do — and when you give in to yours, you are reinforcing their tendency to give in to theirs. **And this reinforcement isn't an unfortunate side effect of your otherwise-noble intentions; it is in fact the _whole point_.**

To put it more simply: we don't hate bad people to make the world a better place; we hate them to make ourselves feel (and look) good _while making it worse_. In fact, we don't even have to feel hatred. Simply seeing a person as irredeemable is already an unmistakable sign that this terrible process is underway in your subconscious.

I realize this is a hard thing to accept, and that you're unlikely to believe me unless you've seen it clearly yourself. But I swear it is the truth — and it is something that you can discover firsthand yourself.

Seeing the full extent of it is what the Buddhists call _enlightenment._ You discover a shocking sense in which _you are everyone and everything._ The very deepest aspect of your mind is pure compassion, as is that of everyone else. But they've forgotten this, just as you yourself had for innumerable lifetimes. The very last thing you could ever want to do is continue to push them _further_ from realizing it — which is the inevitable effect of perceiving them as fundamentally separate from yourself; of forsaking them.

This is not some bleeding heart idea. Kindness does not mean being nice, or sweet, or tolerant, or understanding. It simply means seeing the nature of reality clearly, so that your behavior inspires others to remember the astonishing truth instead of pushing them away from it. Such behavior may be fierce or even violent; it may look nothing like conventional "kindness" on the surface. But the very deepest part of you always knows the difference.

All of the darkness in the world is intimately connected — and part of it lives within your very own mind. By keeping your portion alive, you ensure that it continues to flourish "out there." That is why everything comes down to knowing ourselves deeply, and healing that secret part of us. Only by doing so can we become aware of our complicity in having reinforced the conditions we decry, and to develop the capacity to take them apart.

All misbehavior — from cutting in line to genuine atrocities — is ultimately enabled by a kind of parasite in the mind. Think of it as that devil on our shoulders. But this devil doesn't just whisper obviously-evil ideas in our ears; no, it alters our very perception, so that it appears okay — or even _righteous_ — to step on certain people. It shields us from confronting the full implications of our words and behaviors.

The "bad people" know perfectly well when what they are doing is wrong, but that knowledge is very cleverly hidden from conscious self-reflection. If you try to viciously force them to confront it, it just drives the parasite deeper into their minds. But something in you already knows this.

When _you_ are in the grip of self-deception — and we've all been there — you do not tolerate contemptuous judgement from others. Why? Because it signals to you that _they_ are in a state of self-deception and are in no position to be judging you. You see them as _bad people_ who need to be put in _their_ place, and feel _even more_ licensed to do whatever you need to do — which in turn convinces them that they were right about you all along. It is the **contempt** that drives this outcome, not the mere **judgement** (in the sense of _wise discernment_).

The same is true when the positions are reversed. Self-righteous outrage feels damn good — i.e., both enjoyable and virtuous — and yet something in you knows that it will just make them dig in their heels. The hard thing to admit is that part of you _wants_ this, because it helps you prove just how _bad_ they are; how totally unlike you. But there's one small problem.

Subconsciously, you can perceive that they are actually in the grip of a terrible demon that you yourself share — indeed, that is controlling your mind _right now_ — and this similarity horrifies you. So you shove them deeper into the abyss to hide this fact from yourself — because the deeper they go, the easier it is to perceive them as _fundamentally defective_, as opposed to fellow humans who badly need help. (Indeed, beyond a certain point, even _they_ cannot consciously perceive this of themselves. At that point, who can really blame us for being cruel?)

This actually creates _new_ evil, but it doesn't feel like that. It feels like you are zeroing in on existing evil; exposing or distilling the hidden evil that is already there. It is as though you are finally catching a hold of the source of darkness in the world, and are finally _punishing_ it. It feels impossibly righteous to be nasty to "bad people."

> _And no wonder, for even Satan masquerades as an angel of light. So it is not strange that his ministers also masquerade as ministers of righteousness._ —2 Corinthians 11:14-16
 
But this is all a smokescreen created by your devil. It knows perfectly well that this behavior darkens the world. In fact, that is its whole game. But it must never let you know this, and so it hides this behind _astonishingly_ seductive justifications that you don't even realize are seductions. All you consciously feel is "I'm fighting evil" — and you have all the evidence to prove it.

What "actually" happened was that under the covers, _their_ devil reached out to yours to offer it a secret handshake — and you signaled agreement simply by feeling contempt. **Contempt is the secret tool by which our devils coordinate, beneath our conscious thresholds.** It is the opposite of kindness; that part of you that wants what's best for everyone. No matter how carefully you disguise it — even from yourself — it always leaks out into the world.

<p align="center" width="100%">
    <img width="300px" src="img/shared-devil.png"> 
</p>

If you look carefully, you will discover that our devils together behave more like a single malevolent distributed entity — the _Devil_, if you will. It is that archetypal "evil conspiracy" that we subconsciously fear exists — the one to which all the rest ultimately owe their existence, and to which they all ultimately report — _and every one of us is secretly in on it_. It remains hidden by keeping our attention fixated perpetually outward, blinding us to our own participation.

Every time we feel malice, contempt, or self-righteousness; any time we are unkind to anyone for any reason, we are secretly feeding the Beast. Every act of unkindness ripples through its terrible body, lowering the threshold for more acts of evil to erupt in faraway locations — for which we will feel absolutely no complicity. But part of us always knows.

To be clear, we're certainly not all equally complicit. There are surely groups of particularly "endarkened" people who consciously conspire to cause great harm, and **we must hold such people accountable**. But when we do so with contempt, we are reinforcing the very conditions that effectively _compel_ their existence — and a deep part of us knows this.

So far I have been calling this all "subconscious," but that's not entirely accurate. The greatest shock is discovering that it was somehow _always_ accessible to consciousness, if we'd just bothered to look. This isn't a judgement of us. We _want_ to look, but something keeps stopping us. Our duty is to discover whatever that is, and heal it.

Nobody ultimately _wants_ to be under the sway of their devil — the key word being "ultimately." There are certainly people who willingly harbor it; those whom we classically think of as "evil." It would be foolish to be "kind" to them in the _conventional_ sense. Yet it is far _more_ foolish to feel malice, because that is **exactly** what their demon wants — and it is also where it is hardest to detect our own self-deception, and the easiest to justify it to others. It is the ultimate trap.

The more you unearth your own demon, the more clearly you see that such people are suffering from a kind of Stockholm syndrome — and the more acutely you feel the malevolence of driving them toward their captor. It smothers what little light is left. (If you believe that they _have_ no light, consider that this may be exactly the "trap" I just described.) It is literally the _worst_ time to be unkind. Unconventional means may be necessary to deal with them, but unkindness never is. This could only be true if "kindness" does not mean what we usually think.

**True kindness is not about being _nice._** It can be fierce or even [violent](https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/dalai-gun/) if necessary. It only requires being lucidly aware of your own capacity for self-deception, and refusing to fall into it. It is about staying connected to your Heart; that part of you that remembers the Truth — the very thing that your parasite is lulling you into forgetting. **Your fight is with the parasite. Hating the host just strengthens it.** 

The more you remember this, the more your very way of being inspires others to remember. Then, bit by bit you notice that even "evil" has no fundamental essence; that it is not a thing that can be "fought." It is not a _presence_, but an _absence._ An absence of what?
