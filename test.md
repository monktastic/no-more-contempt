Dear Rev. Sarah Siegel,

I have reviewed your email. Your decision to withhold half of my deposit is based on a series of demonstrably false claims and misrepresentations of the information I provided to your team over the past four months.

I formally reject your offer of a $1,125 partial refund. That partial amount is unacceptable. I demand a full, immediate refund of my $2,250.00 deposit.

1. Your Claim of Late Disclosure is Factually Invalid

Your entire argument hinges on a supposed failure to disclose, yet your own documents prove you were fully informed:

- PVCs Were Disclosed on July 8, 2025: My Intake Questionnaire (signed 7/8/25) explicitly stated my EKG showed "occasional PVCs." You were fully aware of this underlying cardiovascular condition months ago, and I further clarified on October 22nd that the condition has not been an active issue recently.
- You Fabricated My Symptoms: You claim the PVCs are "recent and ongoing," occurring "periodically throughout the day." This is an outright fabrication. I was specifically warning you that the potential for frequent PVCs exists ONLY under conditions of extreme sleep deprivation (the known risk of Iboga): “When I get especially poor sleep… I have periodic PVCs throughout the day.”
- The Xanax Disclosure Was Timely: I disclosed the low-dose Xanax on October 22nd because I had started it very recently, after the July form was filed. Your choice to interpret this responsible update as a deliberate omission confirms your effort to create an excuse to void the contract and retain my funds.
- You Ignored Underlying Illness: My Intake Form (7/8/25) explicitly cited the chronic issue: "Long covid / chronic fatigue syndrome." This condition is the direct root cause of the cardiac and fatigue issues I later detailed.

2. Unacceptable Behavior and Breach of Trust

The sequence of events confirms that you prioritized securing my payment over conducting an honest safety assessment:

- After I expressed concerns about my condition, you instructed me on October 28th to "let go of these stories around the physical issues" and pressured me to proceed instead of inviting me to disclose the details you are now attempting to hold against me.
- You actively dismissed my honesty, accepted my $2,250.00 on November 7th, and then—less than five days later—used my subsequent, good-faith clinical clarification as the basis for a penalty.

I am deeply disappointed. Given your organization's commitment to "healing" and integrity, I find the effort to manufacture a pretext for cancellation and retain my money entirely at odds with your stated mission.

I did not violate the disclosure clause. Your actions demonstrate a profound lack of integrity. You are attempting to keep a non-refundable donation based on information you either already possessed or information you actively discouraged me from detailing further.

3. Final Demand and Legal Notice

Since I did not breach the disclosure agreement, you have no legal grounds to claim any portion of my deposit. You canceled the service shortly after payment and suffered no demonstrable damages. Your retention of $1,125 is unjust enrichment.

I require written confirmation that a full $2,250.00 refund is being processed within 24 hours.

If the full amount is not processed by the end of the day on Friday, November 14, 2025, I will immediately file a Small Claims suit in the appropriate Connecticut Superior Court. I will be seeking the full $2,250.00, plus all court costs and filing fees.

I expect full accountability and your immediate compliance.

Sincerely,

Aditya Prasad
