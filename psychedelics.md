The greatest benefit of psychedelics is that they can expose (if we let them) all the places where we lie to ourselves — the ways in which our behavior doesn't accord with our deepest values; the regrets we know we will have on our death beds; etc.

These revelations can be roughly divided into two levels, though they ultimately meet. The first has to do with our everyday life and interactions, and the second has to do with the nature of reality itself.

I will present these two levels below.

## The personal

Every one of us has skirted our conscience before, pretending either that we couldn't hear it or that we didn't have to listen. In this state, we know _perfectly well_ that what we're doing is wrong, but that knowledge is carefully shielded from conscious self-reflection. We are only aware of the tip of the iceberg of our self-deception. Our mind selectively shows us examples that preserve our self-image.

It is this same state has enabled _all the evil there ever was._ Ours may differ in degree, but not in kind. Deep down, we know that we are not _fundamentally_ better than anyone. Therefore, **contempt for _anyone_ is intrinsically self-deceptive** — and it serves a dark purpose.

Any time we engage in self-deception, we are secretly licensing others to do the same. Our "allies" feel compelled to join our noble mission, and our "enemies" want to fight us. Every act of unkindness lowers the threshold for darkness to emerge elsewhere, manifesting in distant events that we will feel no connection to, let alone complicity in. But part of us always knows. We are creating this smokescreen to make our own self-deception easier to hide.

That is the secret purpose of contempt: we know that we are not better, and they know that we know, and we know that they know that we know, etc. We also know that our contempt will trigger theirs — and the better we hide this knowledge from ourselves, the more effective it will be. Hence we never suspect that we're doing this. For example, we mock our political enemies _so that_ they will dig in their heels, "forcing" us to escalate under the guise of good.

Our dark behavior can indeed suppress other people's misbehavior — in public, anyway, and for a time. Thus, we can easily convince ourselves that it "worked" — but only because we are not looking closely enough.

It is only once we see how thoroughly our own darkness has seduced us that we begin to appreciate how the "bad people" are stuck, and therefore what we can do about it. Until then, we feel compelled to add our own darkness to the world to "fix" it, and then act surprised when the world becomes darker.

From another perspective, it is not _we_ who are spreading darkness, but the Darkness that is _spreading itself_ through us. The darkness in other people's minds invites ours to come out and play. It is a kind of "secret handshake" that we can learn to perceive. In fact, their darkness and ours are not truly separate. They behave more like a _malevolent distributed entity_ with control centers inside each of our minds, coordinating with itself beneath our conscious thresholds.

It is what some know as the _Devil_ — and it is as "real" as anything you can touch. It is that "evil global conspiracy" that some people fear exists. There are indeed evil conspiracies "out there," but every one of them is ultimately rooted in our collective shadow — the _primordial_ evil conspiracy. A good measure of our own involvement is how much contempt we feel for those who we feel to be responsible — the very thing that we normally take as a sign of _good._

The basis of compassion is recognizing that evil is ultimately a deep form of confusion, and that the self-righteousness we feel when confronting it is the very same "entity" secretly finding a backdoor into our own minds. The more clearly we see this, the more "another way" reveals itself.

---

Compassion is the antidote to evil because it is the only activity that is free of self-deception — and thus the only thing that does not pile on _more_. By being free of the pernicious illusion that other people's darkness is _intrinsic_ to their minds, we begin to tease apart the causes and conditions that allow it to fester.

**Such compassion (aka kindness) does not have to be nice.** It can be as fierce (or potentially violent) as the situation warrants. It can use mockery, shame, and even _apparent_ contempt. It allows for genuine contempt for beliefs and behaviors. Almost nothing is off-limits. But it cannot contain even a _trace_ of malice, self-righteousness, or contempt _for people_, because these are _always_ signs of the "Devil" masquerading as the Light.

Such behavior has a very different impact on all minds involved. Its profound integrity prevents the darkness in others from finding the "hook" needed to reinforce itself. Instead, they begin to remember that the Light is not just a myth. This is the _only_ thing that dispels the Darkness. It, too, has a ripple effect.

You could also call this Love — a Love that excludes nobody and nothing, including the target of its wrath. That may sound paradoxical, but you **know** this state. It is what you most fundamentally _are_. The more clearly you see this, the more you see it in everyone else.

The full realization that you are everyone and everything is known as _enlightenment._ It is a lofty goal, but every one of us can sense it to some degree or another at all times. This is the reason that we "know that they know that we know" etc. (formally called [common knowledge](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/common-knowledge/)). Ironically, it is our fundamental unity that enables evil to spread.

You then see that "the Darkness" is nothing but our unwillingness to remember what we most fundamentally are. The easiest way to keep this realization at bay is to encourage "others" to forget, too. That's what evil _is._

Thus, even the most profound evil is ultimately rooted in an innocent mistake — though simply _believing_ this is worse than useless. It is only _authentic insight_ paired with fierce courage, energy, wisdom, etc. that actually makes a dent.

The greatest gift you can offer the world is thus to heal your own shadows — the things preventing you from shining your fierce, authentic Light.

## The transcendent

- We do not know what reality _is_. Is it a dream, simulation, etc.?
  - If you look deeply enough, you'll discover that this fact terrifies you.
  - You hide this fear by convincing yourself that you actually _do_ know, or that it doesn't matter. For example: "This is all just philosophizing. What's the difference, anyway?"
- Sometimes you are powerfully confronted with the fact that you _really don't know._ Such moments can be terrifying, to put it mildly.
- There are two ways to proceed. By far the most common is to keep reminding yourself that you do know; that this is just chemicals in your brain, etc.
- The other way is to give yourself completely over to the terror, and to deeply admit that you haven't a f*cking clue.
- If you surrender fully, you will be "reminded" that there is in fact one thing that you can fall back on; one thing that is completely unquestionable: _something certainly **seems** to be happening._
- You discover that there is something _impossibly astonishing unfolding all around you that just **begs** for an explanation, and for the first time you realize that you don't — can't — have one._
  - This causes you to finally LOOK at it for the first time in your life — or perhaps in countless lives. Think of it: looking for the very first time at the _only thing that has ever been happening! What a trip!_
  - The only reason you never noticed it before is that you were busy continually telling yourself a subtle story about how you knew what it was, what was causing it, etc.
  - This is why they are "magic" mushrooms: because life is and always has been _pure f*cking magic._
- It is not just unfolding "around" you; it somehow IS you! It has always _been_ you, but you somehow never noticed it. 
  - The psychedelics were never even required: all of life has _always_ been this way. You've just been studiously avoiding looking at it! Why? See section 1. 
  - If you're lucky, you "get" to live the lives of every sentient being who has ever existed, to drive the point home **hard**. You see what "karma" is. You've only ever been doing this to yourself.
  - In fact, you created all of "reality" specifically to live out every possible permutation of experience possible (and _impossible_).
  - As wonderful (and horrible) as it has all been, it is now time to wake yourself up, in all of your manifestations.
- As you return to this reality, you vow never to forget — and to stop doing that silly thing where you try to make _others_ forget.
- You (probably) forget anyway. But something remains — something that can never be taken from you.
