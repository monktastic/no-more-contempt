# Part I: Limbo

## The Limbo State

Think back to a time when you skirted your conscienceâ€”acted against your own deepest values while pretending it was okay. In that moment, part of you knew full well that you were doing wrong, but you avoided looking at that knowledge, so that it didnâ€™t _feel_ wrong. All you could hear were your own clever justifications.

The knowledge wasn't unconscious. It was perfectly consciousâ€”it just existed in a kind of limbo state: a bizarre, paradoxical schism of mind, in which you both _knew_ and yet somehow _didnâ€™t._ 

We know we can't win a direct confrontation with our conscience, and we can never truly silence it, so this is the next best thing: have our justifications live alongside it.

Try imagining doing something you know is wrongâ€”_fully_ knowing it's wrong, with no rationalizationâ€”and doing it anyway. Can you even picture it?

The limbo state isn't just about avoiding guilt. It's how we _license ourselves_ in the first place. You literally cannot override your conscience without hiding the knowing from yourself.

It's a profound form of self-deceptionâ€”but it doesn't make you bad. We all do it, as a kind of defense against a seemingly-uncaring world. In ourselves, we see it as a minor flaw, but when others do it, we see them as "bad"â€”giving us one more thing to have to defend against.

Notice how the limbo state was itself in limbo: you've always known about it but likely never brought it fully into conscious awareness.

What else might be lurking down there?

## The Signal

Think back to a time when you mocked or shamed someone with contempt. You probably told yourself you were doing it to helpâ€”if not them, exactly, then at least the world. But if you're honest, part of you just wanted them to feel bad, *quite independently of any good it would do*.

This is a bit malicious, so we hide it from ourselvesâ€”that limbo stateâ€”and yet our target senses it anyway. It weakens their faith in humanity and reminds them that the world is dark. This makes them feel more licensed in their self-deceptionâ€”which we take as a sign of inherent badness. *Strike one*.

What you see is a person who became defensive in response to your righteous behavior, instead of introspecting and thanking you for your wisdom. They're implicitly accusing _you_ of being evil. _Strike two._

But part of you suspects some truth in their accusationâ€”and yet how could they possibly know about your hidden malice? You barely knew it yourself. So their accusation can't be based on anything real. They must be projecting their own darkness onto you. _Strike three._

This person is well and truly defective, justifying your contempt.

And the world is even worse than you'd feared, justifying your self-serving behaviors in generalâ€”while also making it harder for you to recognize them as such.

But part of you suspects you intended this. So you must bury it even harder...

What better way to make someone dig in their heels than to hint that you want them to, while pretending you don't?

It's diabolicalâ€”but how would you pull it off?

If you knew you were doing it, it wouldn't workâ€”it would be too obvious. But if you didn't, then how could you do it at all?

You would have to simultaneously know and yet not.

In fact... that's _all_ you'd have to do. Simply telegraphing your *intent* to drive them into the dark, while pretending you're not, would be enough to actually *cause* it. The intent *is* the execution.

Being in the limbo state telegraphs its own dark purpose to others while hiding itself from you. The hiding *is* the revealing.

It is the perfect crime: no evidence left behind.

The hidden signal did all the work. The mockery was just a convenient delivery vehicle.

---

And yetâ€”isn't there a part of you that already knew this is what happened? That all of us are doing this, in various forms, all the time?

We all know this is happening.

So why is nobody talking about it? Why has nobody named it?

## Shielding

If you could see the person fullyâ€”if you knew their hopes, dreams, and fearsâ€”this would have been hard to pull off, wouldn't it? You had to shield yourself from something. But what was it?

Their full humanity. You donâ€™t need their life story to see yourself in themâ€”thatâ€™s just how you are before the shielding. To not see it, you have to be in limbo: simultaneously feeling their humanity while refusing to fully acknowledge it.

Which means the very feeling of contemptâ€”for the *person themselves*, not just their beliefs or behaviorsâ€”is the sign that you're in limbo. In that darkened state, you cannot help but wish harmâ€”and that wish seeks fulfillment.

And what would happen if you turned that shielding knob up to its maximum?

Then you'd know what it's like to be *evil*.

Evil people don't do a different thing than the rest of usâ€”they just have a stronger version of the same thing. It's not that they don't knowâ€”it's that the knowledge is correspondingly better hidden.

And the stronger someone else's shielding, the stronger the urge to feel contempt for themâ€”as though theirs is somehow *inviting* ours.

## The Stranger

Now suppose a stranger walks in and scolds you for mocking that person. Part of you _knows_ they're right in their accusationâ€”that you're doing essentially the same thing that "evil people" doâ€”but do you thank them for it and repent?

Hell no! You feel more justified in your behavior. Youâ€”a perfectly decent person who knows full well you've done wrongâ€”still dig in your heels when treated with contempt. Why?

It's not just because of your big ego. It's because _you can tell they're not coming from a good place._ You can feel this independently of their words. How? No really, how?

What does that tell you about the people _you_ treat with contemptâ€”even when you're saying all the "right" things; even when you're on the "right side?"; even when they're genuinely wrong?

Don't we already know our contempt makes people worse? Why do we pretend not to?

## The Knowing

Now watch how the game unfoldsâ€”how the hidden signal actually transmits.

I know I'm only pretending to be better than you. And somewhere in me, I know you can sense this falsenessâ€”because part of me is projecting it.

Which means I know I'm being a hypocrite. And I know _you_ know thatâ€”you can feel the lie in my contempt. And I want you to know it, too.

Which means we both know I'm pulling a ruse. There's this weird shared awareness of the game being played. Have you felt that beforeâ€”that you both secretly know what's really going on?

Each level feels different. The first is simple dishonesty. The second adds hypocrisy. By the third, shame starts trying to break throughâ€”so I have to hide harder.

And it keeps going, who knows how many levels deep, eventually reaching what feels like pure malice. And you both know that neither of you can prove itâ€”which is why it works. 

It works not *despite* being unprovable, but _because_ of it. 

What kind of thing works like *that*?

We didn't even need to telegraph our maliceâ€”just that subtle sense of superiority. By maintaining just that, malice naturally came acrossâ€”and darkened minds were the result.

Innocent yet monstrous.

---

You know your enemies can only cause harm due to a mechanism you share. So what makes them "bad," exactly?

Or does "bad" simply mean "okay to pull this ruse on?"

Yet it feels like we can practically *see* their badness, *feel* it, doesn't it? Why?

Maybe that visceral sense of *badness* is just what's needed for us to feel okay harming them.

---

Now think back to a time you acted out of pure integrity. Were any justifications needed?

And a time when you were wrong and someone confronted *you* out of that same integrity. Did you want revenge? How could you tell they were coming from a good place? No really, how?

What were they serving in that moment?

---
## We already know

Doesn't part of us already know this is how it works? **Why aren't we all talking about this?**

It's almost like a shared secret that we've all agreed to keep, lest we spoil the game for everyone. 

But what kind of game is it, and who's really benefiting?

---

Did your behavior with that person darken the world or brighten it? Didn't part of you know the answer even as you did it? *How* did you know? No, reallyâ€”how?

And yet, it felt completely righteous at the time. You probably even could have proven that it was.

One part of you was knowingly darkening the world, while another part was flawlessly confident you were helpingâ€”and *both parts were conscious*. And you've always known this. So why do you think you can you trust your calculations about right and wrong in general?

How do you know this isn't happening _everywhere_ in your life? How could you ever be sure?

We already know all thisâ€”so why hasn't humanity found a solution? All the self-help, spirituality, neuroscience... and we're still off the rails, maybe harder than ever before. How can that be?

Is it just because the _bad people_ keep sabotaging it? Or is there a part of us all that would benefit from *not* finding the solution?

Could that part be what's collectively steering this ship?

It sure would explain a lot, wouldn't it?
