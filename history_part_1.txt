Nobody _wants_ to be depressed. Or rather, people may act like they do, and even say that they do — in which case it is probably kindest to believe them — but the very deepest aspect of their mind simply _couldn't_ want such a thing if it could see clearly what it was choosing. A person may recognize this only after being free of it, and look back on it like a bizarre dream.

It wasn't until recently that empathy for depression became a social norm. Until then, contempt seemed to many like a perfectly healthy response, and sympathy was equated with coddling. Today, we know it's more nuanced: depending on the person and situation, either firmness or gentleness may be appropriate — but in neither case does an underlying attitude of contempt help anything.

Advances in neuroscience certainly helped drive this cultural shift, but were they really necessary? Once we knew that brains and genes were a thing, did we really need to know the exact details to feel empathy for the depressed? Did anyone ever doubt that it had _some_ physiological basis? Anyone "with the eyes to see" could directly perceive that contempt was the wrong approach. It served only to make the attacker feel superior, and it was harmful.

The same is true for alcoholism, addiction, obesity, and countless other conditions. It seems we have to re-learn the same lesson each time, using new science as justification — but it is always possible to see that the deepest aspect of our mind simply couldn't want to suffer. This "empathy shortcut" makes it clear that contempt makes zero sense in such situations. Our descendants will surely wonder how this wasn't obvious from the start.

What may be harder to see is that the base layer of our mind also doesn't want _others_ to suffer. People certainly act like they want this, and even sometimes say that they do — in which case it is dangerously naive not to believe them — but something surprisingly similar is going on beneath the surface. Their confused state is generated by a haze of profound delusion that will horrify them should they manage to break free of it. I do not have the neuroscience to prove this to you (yet), but it is plain for anyone with the eyes to see. It is not merely a belief.

Contempt for "bad people" makes zero sense for exactly the same reason as before: it merely compounds the delusion that's causing the problem to begin with. They are simply under the sway of a different form of mental illness. Our contempt doesn't exist to help anyone; it just helps us feel superior. The very deepest part of us knows this, but that knowledge somehow isn't reaching our conscious awareness.

Social norms have largely (and thankfully) robbed us of our ability to feel superior when treating mentally ill people (or mentally retarded people, or those with different skin color, ...) with contempt. People who do that are rightfully seen as wrong in the head themselves. But then we turn right around and treat _them_ with contempt — unable to see that we are repeating the same fundamental mistake.

If you don't yet have the "eyes to see" this, then it may sound hopelessly naive. But the truth is that the very deepest layer of your mind _cannot want to feel contempt for **anyone**_. If you could clearly see the choice you were making, you wouldn't make it. It is only tempting when in the grip of profound delusion. You may *say* that you want it, and deeply believe that it's helpful, but there will (hopefully) come a time when you are horrified by this confusion.

Just like you can't talk people out of depression, addiction, or evil, I can't talk you out of contempt[^talk-you-out]. Something must be _seen_.

---

Now, an important clarification: in the same way that we might need to be firm with someone with mental illness, we may need to be even more firm — perhaps even violent[^dalai-lama-gun] — with people who "want" to cause harm. Our response may even *look* like contempt. But *genuine* contempt comes from a completely different source; a deeply malicious one. They should not be confused.

It can be very hard to see how this change in motivation makes any difference. After all, violence is violence, right? But it's not. People are _ridiculously_ sensitive to our intentions, and malice generates very different long-term consequences than benevolence. This difference may not be obvious from the immediate (or even second- or third-order) effects, but again, it is visible to those with eyes to see.

When all desire for harm (for oneself and others) is eliminated from the mind, what remains isn't apathy or neutrality. Surprisingly, it is an impossibly fierce and uncompromising love for the world — one that is able to deal with all kinds of situations in a healthy way[^jesus].

My hope for humanity is that we discover this. I believe our very existence depends on it.

> _Be kind, for everyone you meet is fighting a great battle._ —Author unknown

It is easy to be kind to someone when we can see that they're trying. Otherwise, we have two options: find some part of them that _is_ trying and be kind to it, or else be unkind to their whole being. The latter is contempt, and it is lazy and harmful. There is literally _always_ a part that is trying.

Consider depression. Nobody _wants_ to be depressed. Or rather, people may _act_ like they do, and even _say_ that they do — in which case it is probably kindest to believe them — but the very deepest aspect of their mind simply _couldn't_ want such a thing, if it could see clearly what it was choosing. A person may recognize this only after being free of it, and look back on it like a bizarre dream.

It wasn't until recently that empathy for the depressed became a social norm. Until then, contempt seemed to many like a perfectly healthy response, and sympathy was equated with coddling. Today, we know better: depending on the person and situation, either firmness or gentleness may be appropriate, but in neither case does an underlying attitude of contempt help anything. The justification that "coddling is bad, so cruelty is good" is clearly self-serving nonsense: it is an excuse for our dark tendencies.

Advances in neuroscience certainly helped drive this cultural shift, but were they really necessary? Once we knew that brains and genes were a thing, did we really need to know the exact details to see that empathy was right? Did anyone ever doubt that depression had _some_ physiological basis? Anyone "with the eyes to see" could directly perceive that contempt was the wrong approach without waiting for proof.

The same is true for alcoholism, addiction, obesity, and countless other conditions. It seems we have to re-learn the same lesson each time, using new science as justification — even though it is always possible to see that the deepest aspect of people's minds simply couldn't want to suffer. This "empathy shortcut" makes it clear that contempt makes zero sense in such situations. "Tough love" may still be required, but it is still a form of love, not contempt — and the deepest aspect of *our* mind knows the difference. Our descendants will surely wonder how we ever overlooked it.

What may be harder to see is that this "base layer of mind" also doesn't want _others_ to suffer. People certainly act like they do, and even sometimes say that they do — in which case it is dangerously naive not to believe them — but something surprisingly similar is going on beneath the surface. Their confused state is generated by a haze of profound delusion that would horrify them should they manage to break free of it. I do not have the neuroscience to prove this to you (yet), but it is plain for anyone with the eyes to see. It is not merely a belief.

Contempt for "perpetrators" is bad for exactly the same reason as for "victims": it merely compounds the delusion that's causing the problem to begin with. It is a more cleverly disguised form of mental illness. The very deepest part of us knows this, but that knowledge somehow isn't reaching our conscious awareness.

Social norms have largely robbed us of our ability to feel superior when treating mentally ill people (or mentally retarded people, or those with different skin color, ...) with contempt. People who do that are rightfully seen as wrong in the head themselves. But then we turn right around and treat _them_ with contempt — unable to see that we are repeating the same fundamental mistake.

If you don't yet have "the eyes to see" this, then compassion for evildoers may sound hopelessly naive. But if so, then I contend that your mind is still under the grip of a powerful delusion. You may *say* that contempt is more helpful — and even believe it — but there will (hopefully) come a time when you are horrified by this confusion. The very deepest layer of your mind cannot want to feel contempt for **anyone**. If you could clearly see the choice you were making, you wouldn't make it.

Alas, just like we can't talk people out of depression, addiction, or evil, I can't talk you out of contempt[^talk-you-out]. There is something that must be _seen_.

Now, an important clarification must be made: in the same way that we might need to be firm with the mentally ill, we may need to be even more firm — perhaps even violent[^dalai-lama-gun] — with people who "want" to cause harm. Such a response may even *look* like contempt. But *genuine* contempt comes from a completely different source; a deeply malicious one. The two should not be confused[^confusion].

We know that being kind is the "right thing to do" in general, but things get hazy when it comes to "bad" people. Not only is it hard to be kind to them, but it's a bit unclear _why_ and even _whether_ we should. At the same time, there are many people who seem to be "bad" enough for this question to be directly relevant to us. They may not deserve our cruelty (yet), but they surely deserve our contempt. It feels like the _least_ we could do as decent people.

But what if there _is_ a sense in which kindness (properly defined) is _always_ the right thing to do, and our "innocent" deviation from it is responsible for tremendously more suffering than we realize?

Contempt is hard to define, but here's a rough starting point: it's the feeling that someone is worthless or beneath consideration — often accompanied by a desire to make sure they know it. It is the sense that they are fundamentally defective (in the case of "bad people," fundamentally _morally_ defective). We generally want the best for people, even when they mess up. With contempt, this desire evaporates, and may even be replaced with malice. It often starts off much milder, with subtle feelings of suspicion and uncharitability. But these turn out to be self-reinforcing, as we shall see.

Before we begin, what is contempt? It is easier to describe than define.

Imagine you are debating politics with someone whom you at first trust is well-intentioned. Slowly, as their position is revealed, you begin to doubt their intentions. Eventually, you become convinced that they could only believe these things if they were _fundamentally morally defective_.

It is this _fundamental-ness_ that is the defining characteristic of contempt, whether the defect itself is moral or not. Genocides are carried out when people believe their victims are _fundamentally_ sub-human[^genocide] (and not merely humans with "worse" religions or ethnicities). While our own contempt may not rise to the level of enabling atrocities — yet — it is a milder form of the same phenomenon. In this dark place, all goodwill is lost.

Mocking our political enemies is fun because we get to see them hurt, quite independently of whether the behavior is a net good — though of course we must tell ourselves that it is one. Our "victim" cannot be fixed, so it is only right to punish them — and what more humane way to punish someone than to subtly communicate, through our eyes and voice, how worthless they are? That is how it usually starts, but rarely how it ends.

The feeling can also be much more subtle and brief, as when we mutter "idiot" under our breath at a bad driver. But if left unchecked, this attitude becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy. Perhaps a part of us secretly _wants_ that...

Before we begin, what is contempt? It is easier to describe than define.

Consider how most of us seem to feel about our political opponents these days. They don't just have bad ideas; they seem _defective_ in some fundamental way. How else could they believe the ridiculous things they do (or claim to, anyway)? This _fundamental-ness_ is a defining characteristic of contempt; we are fundamentally better people than they are.

Genocides can only be carried out when people believe their victims are sub-human. It's not sufficient for them to be humans with "worse" religions or ethnicities; they must be something... _less_[^genocide]. While our own contempt may not rise to the level of enabling atrocities — yet — it is a milder form of the same phenomenon. 

In this dark place, all goodwill is lost.

But what if there is a sense in which kindness (properly defined) is _always_ the right thing to do, and our "innocent" deviation from it is responsible for tremendously more suffering than we realize? 

This site is a collection of pieces exploring that question.

Before we begin, what is contempt? It is easier to describe than define.

Consider how most of us seem to feel about our political opponents these days. They don't just have bad ideas; they seem _defective_ in some fundamental way. How else could they believe the ridiculous things they do (or claim to, anyway)? This _fundamental-ness_ is a defining characteristic of contempt; we are fundamentally better people than they are.

Genocides can only be carried out when people believe their victims are sub-human. It's not sufficient for them to be humans with "worse" religions or ethnicities; they must be something... _less_[^genocide]. While our own contempt may not rise to the level of enabling atrocities — yet — it is a milder form of the same phenomenon. 

In this dark place, all goodwill is lost. 

Mocking our political enemies is "innocent" fun, because we get to see bad people get hurt. This enjoyment is quite independent of whether our behavior somehow makes a positive difference in the world — though, of course, we must _tell_ ourselves that it does. Our "victim" cannot be fixed, so it is only right to punish them — and what more humane way than to subtly communicate, through our eyes and voice, how worthless they are? That is how it usually starts, but rarely how it ends.

The feeling can also be much more subtle and brief, as when we mutter "idiot" under our breath at a bad driver, or even just suspicion and uncharitability toward a dialogue partner. But if left unchecked, this attitude becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy. And when _all_ of us are doing that, well... the result is bad, as we shall see.

Note that we make liberal use of the word "evil." This word should be understood in its most general sense, as the opposite of "good." We will examine its nature and causes.

[^genocide]: The Nazis referred to Jews as 'vermin' and during the genocide in Rwanda, Tutsis were referred to as 'cockroaches.' This is a common pattern throughout history.
