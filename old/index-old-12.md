> _Be kind, for everyone you meet is fighting a great battle._ —Author unknown

Why do wise people urge compassion for evildoers? Are they being naïve? Or could it be that they see something that we don't?

---

Consider the "bad people" — the greedy bankers, hypocritical CEOs, corrupt politicians, etc. — and how they're able to screw over others without apparent remorse. It really makes your blood boil, doesn't it? What has happened is that their minds have altered their perception of reality such that other people appear fundamentally inferior; subhuman, and thus acceptable to harm.

Do they know that they're doing this? Well, yes and no. Part of them knows _perfectly well_, of course — but that knowledge is carefully shielded from conscious self-reflection. All they hear are their own clever justifications. It is this state that has enabled _all the evil there ever was_ — and it has enabled our own misbehavior too, if we're honest. Every one of us has skirted our conscience before, pretending either that we couldn't hear it or that we didn't have to listen. Our examples may differ in degree, but not in kind.

This mind-state is infectious: simply by engaging in it, the "bad people" induce it in others. The dark part of their mind is trying to spread it, because the more normalized it becomes, the less they will have to confront it in themselves. This allows it to remain hidden. That part _wants_ you to hate them — because the darker your perception becomes, the more you will abandon your own deepest values, licensing yourself to behave in ways that you otherwise couldn't, and thereby spreading the infection yourself. But _you won't realize that you're doing this._ You will feel flawlessly convinced that you are "fighting evil" — and how could that ever be wrong?

You will even have evidence to prove it. Your darkness can indeed suppress other people's misbehavior — at least, their _public_ misbehavior, for a time. You will thus convince yourself that it "worked." But even if you manage to violently eradicate your enemies, doing so from this profoundly dark place will powerfully awaken the shadows of every person whose mind it touches, directly or indirectly, "friend" or "foe" — and a secret part of your mind will know that did this, because it is _doing it on purpose_. You have no idea how good your mind is at generating darkness while convincing you that it's somebody else's fault.

<p align="center" width="100%"><img width="300px" src="img/devil-vs-devil.png"></p>

In that darkened state, you're not just licensing yourself to hate "bad people," like you tell yourself. Your mind uses this liminal space to get away with all manner of hidden desires; desires that you may not even realize you have. For some people, it is about money or power, but for others it is (ironically) about looking and feeling like "good people" — people who therefore deserve to get away with _more_.

What happened is that your darkness heard the clarion call of theirs, recognizing it as a perfect opportunity to lure you into this state for its own sinister purposes, under the guise of "good." It is a kind of "secret handshake" between their shadow and yours. You have now become a silent beacon of the darkness yourself — but you won't (consciously) recognize it. You will be convinced that it is noble, and your ideology will support this belief.

What happens on the surface of our minds — our "good intentions" — ultimately matters far less than the covert activity taking place underneath; activity that most of us are normally unconscious of. It is this hidden activity that secretly runs the world.

Contempt for other people (as opposed to their _beliefs_ or _behaviors_) is only ever a sign of self-deception. Any action taken from this state _will_ darken the world in some way that you will be unconscious of — except that it's not truly unconscious. **It is entirely accessible to consciousness, if only we look. The problem is that we choose not to look — for _precisely_ the same reason that the "bad people" never do:** beyond a certain point, it is too painful to confront what we have done. We are in too deep.

> _And no wonder, for even Satan masquerades as an angel of light. So it is not strange that his ministers also masquerade as ministers of righteousness._ —2 Corinthians 11:14-16

The more carefully you look, the more you discover the distinctive fingerprints of your own darkness imprinted on events distant in time and space; events that you previously never would have dreamed of having any connection to, let alone complicity in. All the darkness you have ever leaked into this world still remains, patiently waiting for you to clean it up — and you can identify it in the places that trigger you the most; the places that elicit _self-righteous outrage_. At the same time, these are where you will feel the most justified to layer on _more_ — and where your "allies" will support you in doing so. In fact, this is what most "alliance" really is: dividing us into categories of justifications for cruelty. This way, we never suspect our true enemy. It is the _perfect_ trap. In fact, it almost smells... designed.

From a certain perspective, the darkness appears sentient; even intelligent. It is that phenomenon that the ancients knew as the _Devil_[^devil]: a distributed malevolent entity manipulating all of our minds, communicating with itself beneath our conscious thresholds; subtly altering our perceptions, while convincing us that it doesn't exist — or that it doesn't exist within _us_, the righteous. Ironically, this is the _surest_ sign that our mind has been overtaken.

In more modern terms, it is the "evil global conspiracy": a secret cabal pulling all the strings, and yet hidden so well that nobody even suspects its existence — let alone that _part of their own mind is secretly in on it_. It is the _primordial_ evil conspiracy; the one to which all the rest owe their existence, and to which they ultimately filter up — and we are its minions.

<p align="center" width="100%"><img width="300px" src="./img/shared-devil.png"></p>

You can think of this as an allegory, but you can also learn to perceive it clearly and directly.

It is easy to sense its sinister presence in classically dark places – the archetypal "locker room" in which men dehumanize women, which later manifests in unspeakable conduct. With a little more sensitivity, you can detect it in the places where people gather to _hate_ men for doing this — and with more still, in the defensive reactions that cause men to believe that no such phenomenon could possibly exist simply because they are unable to see it yet. On and on it goes, effortlessly slithering through minds.

Countless similar patterns exist, for race, religion... you name it. Just visit any Facebook group and witness throngs of people being casually cruel to each other, believing that they're making things better — not realizing that they are simply feeding the Beast. We are all fighting a common enemy, and yet it has convinced us that we will overcome it by viciously fighting each other.

[^devil]: Though in some versions, he is just a _tempter_: he is checking whether you will abandon God (or your inner Light) but has no power (or even desire) to make you do so. I like this variant, because it makes it clear that that decision is entirely on us.

The elites may well be playing us off each other to take attention off of them, but the Devil is playing a _much_ bigger game — one in which even the elites are merely pawns. It tricks you into hating them specifically to draw your attention away from its presence in your own mind — the one place you actually have the power to dispel it, and from there, liberate other minds. It convinces you that your compassion isn't powerful enough to combat evil; that it is something soft and weak. This is a dark lie. Compassion is the _only_ thing capable of genuinely dispelling evil — because it is the only condition that is genuinely _free_ of it.

The classic image of the angel and devil on your shoulders is almost correct, except for two things. 

First, your devil doesn't just whisper obviously-bad ideas in your ear, like in the cartoons; no, it alters your very perception such that certain evils appear unmistakably righteous. It is extrinsic to your mind; a kind of parasite — and like all parasites, it can be evicted.

<p align="center" width="100%"><img width="300px" src="./img/parasite.png"></p>

Your angel, on the other hand, is intrinsic. It is a metaphor for that place in your mind that the devil can never touch; the very deepest part of you; your fundamental goodness. It is what remains when all self-deception evaporates.

Your angel can see perfectly well that other people's minds have merely been hijacked by their devils; that it's not intrinsic to their nature. Even those who have _knowingly invited it in_ — and make no mistake, some people have — deserve to be freed of it. Contempt is nothing but the violent urge to shove them _deeper into_ its clutches, where we will feel even more licensed to be cruel, in a vicious feedback loop.

That is why your devil's cleverest trick is to make _other people's_ devils appear intrinsic. Think about the "bad people." Don't they seem _fundamentally morally defective,_ and thus entirely unlike us? By definition such people cannot be helped; they can only be punished or subdued. The truth is, you don't actually know who can be freed and who cannot — and the only reason to believe they cannot is to make harming them feel righteous. It is a trap. Compassion is simply freedom from this pernicious illusion.

> _For so long as the root of wickedness is hidden, it is strong. But when it is recognized, it is dissolved. When it is revealed, it perishes. ... It is powerful because we have not recognized it._ — The Gospel of Philip

Compassion does not have to be nice. In fact, the more ensnared by darkness a person is, the more fierce — or even _violent_ — compassion for them must be. It can look like mocking and shaming, or even _apparent_ contempt or hatred. Almost nothing is off-limits. At the same time, the easier it becomes to lie to yourself about your true intentions: are you being of genuine service to the world, or using it as cover for something much darker?

It is precisely this difficulty that the Devil uses to sneak into your mind undetected. It knows that you will use the _content_ of your thoughts — "oh, I'm just protecting the innocent" — to determine the morality of your actions, and so it generates exceedingly clever justifications that it knows will fool you. The more you listen to it, the smarter it gets, until even thoughts that once would have struck you as obviously-evil now seem unmistakably good. That is why you must learn to see _past_ your thoughts, and hear a voice that is much deeper.

[//]: # (This is why "the road to hell is paved with good intentions": because our conscious intentions are rarely our true intentions.)

<p align="center" width="100%"><img width="300px" src="./img/half-evil.png"></p>

Part of you _always_ knows which voice you are listening to, and everything comes down to becoming conscious of it. I can't tell you how to do it, but luckily, the deepest part of you already knows. There are also a few hints that can be helpful.

If there is even a _trace_ of malice, contempt (for the person), or self-righteousness, then it is *always* your shadow. Same with seeing the world in black and white: dividing people into the _intrinsically_ good and bad; victims and perpetrators; those who deserve your compassion and those who deserve your hatred[^films]. It will make a big show of being sweet to the victims and cruel to the perpetrators, as a way of keeping you in the dark about what is really going. You will not recognize it in yourself, but others very much can (if only subconsciously). Unless they are relatively free of the darkness themselvdes, they will feel contempt for you, thus "unknowingly" perpetuating the cycle.

Your true enemy is not other people, but the darkness that has infected all of our minds. Everything comes down to seeing how it has hijacked both ourselves and others, and recognizing what help we can offer to free them of it — whether that requires patience and understanding, or wrath and ferocity. The more you become free yourself, the more you recognize what is needed in others.

[^films]: Revenge fantasy films are attempting to make you see the world this way. That's right, they are the work of "the Devil."

You do not deserve contemptuous judgement for having spread evil, even if some part of you is doing it knowingly — and _especially_ if you are not ready to see it yet. Doing so would just drive it deeper into your mind. You've simply fallen prey to a very elaborate scheme; the most devious and insidious one possible. Its whole trick is to convince you that _other people_ are ultimately responsible for it, when they, too, are caught in its insane web. Compassion is simply the intention to pull people _out_ of this trap instead of shoving them _deeper in_. To be effective, it must be paired with _wisdom_, which is the knowledge of how to turn that intention into action. Such wisdom is the work of a lifetime, and is beyond the scope of this piece.

Said another way, _compassion is nothing but freedom from self-deception_, and in that way can never be the wrong motivation. It means having clear insight into the part of you that is every bit as fallible and corruptible as the worst among us. However much credit you wish to take for resisting it, you have to admit that tremendous amounts of grace were involved — and that you're probably _still_ nowhere near free of it. It is exactly this grace that you have to offer others.

Ironically, we eventually discover that our resistance to sharing this gift is because part of us isn't ready to accept it ourselves. This is the hardest part to talk about, because it transcends our usual perceptions of ourselves and the world. Everything you do to the world you ultimately do to yourself, because in a profound and surprising sense, [_you are the world_](unity.md). Realizing this is sometimes called _enlightenment_. Your desire to forsake others is ultimately an attempt to forsake yourself, because you're not ready to "come home" yet. These words might not mean much to you now, but part of you can always sense their truth.

Ultimately, the reason to show "other people" compassion is that it's the _only_ path to the more beautiful world your heart most secretly longs for[^Charles]. All else is illusion.

[^Charles] Yes, this is a nod to [Charles Eisenstein](https://www.amazon.com/Beautiful-Hearts-Possible-Sacred-Activism/dp/1583947248).

_Everything_ you do matters. It is your choice in each moment whether to withhold your inner Light or to shine it brightly. It is the responsibility of each one of us to discover what is preventing us from fully committing to the latter, and healing it. This is the greatest gift that we have to offer each other.

May we all find the courage to remember this. May we all find our way home.

> *Nail on the head brother. My most recent mushroom trip (also the largest dose I've ever taken) I became fixated on a news story I had heard that week. About an 8 year old girl from a tribe in the Amazon, who was tied to a tree and burned alive in order to scare her people off their land so it could be logged. I realized that at the moment he did it, whoever lit that gasoline actually felt / thought more or less okay about what he was doing. **And my mind was illuminated with dozens of the parallels between that man's malformed, horrific perceptual / behavioral state, and mine. I saw the same mistakes in value attribution, the same willful ignorance of the consequences of my acts and words. And there was nothing I could do to deny the similarity.***
