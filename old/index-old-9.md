What if nearly everything you're doing to "fight evil" is secretly strengthening it — and moreover, what if part of you already knows this, but is actively concealing it from your conscious mind?

---

Take a moment to reflect on what's wrong with the world, and bring to mind the people responsible: the greedy bankers; the hypocritical CEOs; the corrupt politicians (and all who support them), perhaps. Don't they seem not only morally defective, but somehow _fundamentally_ so? Such people cannot be helped; they can only be subdued or punished. Treating them with contempt is therefore not only acceptable but positively righteous.

This is an illusion. People are only able to misbehave due to a kind of self-deception: part of them knows perfectly well that they are doing wrong, but that knowledge is very cleverly shielded from conscious self-reflection. Contempt is secretly designed to trigger people's defense mechanisms, making them _more_ likely to engage in self-deception; more likely to commit "evil." This is a very hard thing to admit to oneself.



---


The more powerful this shielding, the more "evil" the person appears. In fact, it is this very mechanism that has enabled _all the evil there ever was_ — and it has enabled our own misbehavior too, if we're honest. We have all skirted our conscience before, pretending either that we couldn't hear it or that we didn't have to. Our own instances may differ in degree, but not in kind.

When we encounter others in this state, we don't perceive fellow humans under the sway of a powerful delusion that we ourselves are highly susceptible to; no, we see them as completely unlike us. There is no desire to pull them _out_ of that state; on the contrary, something in us wants to shove them deeper _in_. It is as though they have invited the darkness into their minds, and we are punishing them by keeping them trapped there.

When we mock and shame our political enemies, it is as though we are trying to convince them of what _bad people_ they are. We tell ourselves that this will help somehow, either by forcing them to reflect, or at least convincing others not to join them. But while this may achieve some temporary benefit (such as suppressing their misbehavior — in public, anyway), it is a fundamentally violent act. It serves to remind them that the world is a dark and unforgiving place — exactly what their self-deception is designed to protect them from. Whatever storyline they were using to justify their misbehavior has now been _strengthened_ to deal with this new threat. They appear recalcitrant, which just proves to us that they really _are_ fundamentally defective.

We don't get to see all the downstream effects — a humiliated (and perhaps overworked) father taking his embarrassment out on his children, who then grow up to become "bad people" themselves. And even if by some miracle we do, we avoid acknowledging our own complicity. Sure, we may have provoked him, but why didn't he use it as an opportunity to become _better_? This just proves that he's _bad_. While it's hard to know whether the net result is good or bad (think _butterfly effect_), there is something that we _can_ know.

If you look carefully enough into your mind while feeling contempt — and this is hard — you'll discover that it is secretly _designed_ to darken the world. We _want_ our enemies to dig in their heels, because it vindicates our perception of them. If we can confirm that they are as bad as we feared, then we will eventually be justified in unleashing the full extent of our righteous fury — and there is nothing more primally satisfying than violently destroying evil. So we behave in ways that very cleverly trigger their defense mechanisms; to *strengthen* their capacity for self-deception. It is as though we are trying to draw out the evil that we "know" is already in there, but in actuality we are creating more.

You have **no idea** how good you are at creating and maintaining enemies to justify and reinforce your view of the world; your infallible story of "good guys" and "bad guys." That's because the part of you that does this hides itself from your consciousness just as cleverly as "bad people's" misbehavior is hidden from them. It is completely accessible to consciousness, if you look. But somehow, we never look.

<p align="center" width="100%"><img width="300px" src="../img/half-evil.png"></p>

This is **profound** self-deception — and by engaging in it, you invite others into that state. If you were to suddenly perceive the full extent of its impact, your whole perception of the world — and the stories of blame that scaffold it — would suddenly come crashing down. Therefore, you are unlikely to believe me when I tell you that this is what is really happening, unless you've already seen it clearly operating in yourself.

Our seemingly-innocent perception of people as _fundamentally defective_ is not so innocent. It does not stay confined to our own minds. Instead, we use all of our capacities to _enforce_ it onto reality. Whatever little potential people may have to become free of their darkness, we violently squeeze out of them with our firm conviction that they have no such potential. One way or another, our darkness _always_ finds a way to leak into the world, slowly massaging it into the shape we need for everything to make sense. Even if we're not in direct contact with our target, our contempt darkens the minds of all in our orbit — "allies," enemies, and bystanders alike — and from there, ripples outward. This isn't just a wild hypothesis: you can learn to perceive it directly yourself.

It is a profoundly humbling realization. How did we ever expect the "bad people" to confront their self-deception when we — the "good people" — couldn't detect our own? We are left with no leg to stand on. It is only once you see this clearly that you begin to appreciate the magnitude of what the "bad people" are up against — and that you learn to be of genuine service in fighting it.

> _Why do you look at the speck of sawdust in your brother’s eye and pay no attention to the plank in your own eye? How can you say to your brother, ‘Let me take the speck out of your eye,’ when all the time there is a plank in your own eye? You hypocrite, first take the plank out of your own eye, and then you will see clearly to remove the speck from your brother’s eye._ —Matthew 7:3-5

This self-deception is caused by a kind of parasite in the mind. Think of it as that little devil on your shoulder. But unlike in the cartoons, this devil doesn't just whisper obviously-bad ideas in your ear; no, it alters your very perception at such a fundamental level that you don't even realize you're being tricked. You just see it as "how things are."

<p align="center" width="100%"><img width="300px" src="../img/parasite.png"></p>

The key insight is that this devil is a _parasite_; it is extrinsic to your mind. Unlike your angel — which is intrinsic, and represents your fundamental goodness — your devil can be evicted, bit by bit. But every time you listen to it — that is, every time you give in to your self-deception — it burrows a little bit deeper into your mind, feeling more and more like "you" (or your inner angel) with each step. The more this happens, the more you appear "evil" to others, but the more righteous you feel.

People don't listen to their devil because they're _bad_ — even though it (very convincingly) appears that way. Instead, the particular set of causes and conditions that have given rise to their present being — which you can think of as having accumulated over lifetimes, perhaps stored in what we now think of as their epigenome — somehow makes them feel like listening to it is the "right" thing to do. They have been very cleverly lulled to sleep.

The point is not to feel sorry for evil people, but to gain insight into the bizarre mechanism that has overtaken their minds. The most important thing to see here is that the very same mechanism exists in yours. It is _your_ parasite that makes you see them (or anyone else) as _fundamentally defective_; to see their evil as somehow intrinsic to their minds.

It is well known that even Hitler thought that he was doing something noble. I'll refrain from quoting him directly[^Hitler], but he genuinely believed that he was saving the world from the Devil, which had somehow manifested into the world as the Jewish people. It is easy for us to recognize this as profound delusion, but it is much harder to see that the vile misperception that affected him is _precisely_ the same one that makes us perceive him as "intrinsically" evil; something that we ourselves could never ever be.

This is a subtle point, so I don't want it to be misunderstood. He was surely deluded enough to deserve the label "evil," and being kind to him in the conventional sense would have been dangerously stupid. But the belief that he (and the Nazi army) were somehow _fundamentally_ different from us is a dark lie that our parasite uses to invite itself deeper into our minds, bit by bit. Its whole trick is to make you believe that you are special and immune; that only _other_ people are susceptible. This is how you learn to overlook your own misbehavior, quickly becoming convinced that you either don't have any, or that yours isn't causing much harm to the world.

Our parasite leverages our primal need to see ourselves as "good people" to cause mayhem. This instinct may seem noble, but it creates a perverse incentive: the only way to be "good" in the relative sense is for "bad" people to exist. The worse other people become, the better we look by comparison. Thus, our subconscious is on the prowl for people it can _make_ worse. But of course, being "good people," we can't do this to just anyone. So our parasite makes us see some people as _fundamentally defective_, so that harming them suddenly becomes noble. Everyone else must be treated with "compassion," and we make a big show of being their saviors.

<p align="center" width="100%"><img width="300px" src="../img/good-vs-bad.png"></p>

This works — for a while. The problem is that the more we do this, the more we begin to suspect a disturbing truth: such behavior isn't evidence of how _different_ we are from the "bad people," but how _similar_ we are. We have two options at this point: to admit and renounce the sordid  game we've been playing, or to double down. For the most part, we choose the latter. We drive this knowledge ever-further out of consciousness, securely locking it away under lock and key. But we cannot outrun it forever.

Sooner or later, the funhouse of mirrors comes crashing down, and we are forced to confront what profound hypocrites we've been. This discovery hurts like Hell — but it also triggers the deepest introspection of our lives. We discover that we never wanted to do this. We never wanted to hurt anyone, and ultimately never _could_ want such a thing — because what we are in our innermost selves is _pure, unadulterated Goodness._ This is a very difficult thing to describe without sounding "woo," but there's no other way to put it without losing its enormity.

The deepest aspect of your mind is pure compassion; Light beyond measure. Its only job is to dispel the darkness in the world. As astonishing as this realization is, what's even more remarkable is that when you see it in yourself, you simultaneously see it in everybody else, too. That's because, in a profound and surprising sense, [you _are_ everybody and everything else](../unity.md). In a flash, you discover the full extent of the horrifying confusion that binds humanity. You somehow perceive all the great battles that have led to the creation of "evil people." By forsaking them, you are only forsaking Yourself. Such behavior is itself "evil," but you only did it because you weren't ready to come Home yet. Everyone else was similarly lost, and in their deep confusion tried to prevent you from coming Home too. That's all "evil" ultimately _is_ — an innocent mistake that has grown to truly epic proportions.

I know this story may be hard to swallow, but I promise that it's something you can discover for yourself. Indeed, the deepest part of you already knows it.

By discovering your _absolute_ goodness, you begin to relinquish your need for _relative_ goodness. This undoes the illusion that motivates contempt. You slowly lose the dark urge to push people further into the abyss. Instead, you start to discover a better way. But before we explore that way, let's look at this whole thing from another angle.

---

<p align="center" width="100%"><img width="300px" src="../img/devil-vs-devil.png"></p>

When you treat a "bad person" with contempt, you are secretly indicating to their parasite that you are similarly infected. It is a kind of secret handshake — one that their parasite readily accepts. Both you and your enemy will behave in ways that provide the _other_ person's parasite with exactly the excuses it needs to embed itself deeper into its host. In this way, _all_ of our parasites are intimately connected. In fact, they aren't truly separate. If you look closely enough, you'll discover that they behave more like a single distributed malevolent entity, communicating with itself beneath our conscious thresholds. If our parasites are that little devil on our shoulders, then this "entity" is the _Devil._

It continually drives humanity toward various kinds of Armageddon: situations in which everyone is violently proving how _righteous_ they are. It is why the US is headed toward civil war without anyone suspecting their own complicity, and explains bitter [divorces](https://www.gottman.com/blog/this-one-thing-is-the-biggest-predictor-of-divorce/) in which each side feels like the exclusive victim / hero. Nearly the whole world is caught in its terrible sway, evil provoking "righteous" retribution at every turn, without anyone ever noticing the true source of it all.

<p align="center" width="100%"><img width="300px" src="../img/shared-devil.png"></p>

You know that "evil global conspiracy" that some people fear exists — the one that's somehow responsible for all the world's ills, yet which hides itself so perfectly that people never even suspect its existence? Well, _this is it_ — the _primordial_ evil conspiracy; the one to which all the rest ultimately owe their existence, and to which they all filter up. The reason we can't pin it down "out there" is because it lives deep within the shadows of all of our own minds. From in there, it knows _exactly_ what buttons to press to prevent us from ever suspecting our own involvement.

It may well be true that "the elites" are playing regular people off each other to take attention away from them, but the Devil is playing a _much_ larger game; one in which the elites are merely pawns. It's not that they mustn't be stopped — it's that the contempt with which we do so reinforces the very conditions that effectively compel their existence in the first place. The details of who is in power may change, but their underlying essence does not — and _cannot_ for as long as we're unaware of our own complicity. Every single act of unkindness that we perpetrate ripples out into the world, influencing faraway events, so that we never notice our connection to them.

<p align="center" width="100%"><img width="300px" src="../img/evil-conspiracy.png"></p>

To be clear: there are certainly people who are knowingly and intentionally causing mayhem, and for whom the label "evil" may indeed serve a useful purpose. But if you still perceive this evil as _intrinsic_ to their minds, it only means that your own parasite is still operating, cleverly tempting you. People who are free of their parasites simply do not perceive reality this way. They cannot feel even the slightest trace of malice, contempt, or self-righteousness toward _anyone_. That's because they are able to perceive the part of people that genuinely wants to be _free_ of their parasite. This enables them to act with compassion — the "better way" that we hinted at before.

Compassion (aka kindness) does not mean being nice, or sweet, or forgiving, or even understanding. It is simply the absence of self-deception. It can be as fierce (or potentially even violent) as the situation warrants. But it never falls into the illusion of being fundamentally better than anyone, and this makes all the difference.

Again, when you show contempt — for the _person_, not just their ideas or behavior — you are putting your own self-deception on clear display. The deepest part of you knows that you're not ultimately better than anyone (like you are currently pretending to be). And the deepest part of _them_ can see this, even if only subconsciously. They can sense that you are a hypocrite, and this enables them to ignore any genuinely righteous content in your message. Even worse, it teaches them that there _are_ no genuinely decent people; that even the "good people" are just faking it. Any "inner Light" thus becomes even more of a naive myth.

When self-deception is absent, the opposite occurs. Their parasite is confronted with the one thing it cannot stand: authentic Goodness. It is robbed of its power to justify its own existence, because it is in the presence of something immeasurably greater and truer. This is _very_ difficult to describe, but I know you've felt it before. Everything comes down to standing firmly in your inner Light, _especially_ when confronted with the greatest depths of Darkness, when you are most tempted to abandon it. It may not eliminate evil as quickly as you'd like, or be as deliciously satisfying as giving in to self-righteousness, but it is the _only_ way toward the world your heart most deeply desires.

Ultimately, the Darkness is not an entity in its own right, but merely the absence of Light. The fact that it can _behave_ like such an entity — the Devil — is truly one of the most astonishing facts of existence. This is why, as MLK Jr said:

> *Darkness cannot drive out darkness, only light can do that. Hate cannot drive out hate, only love can do that.* ― Martin Luther King, Jr.

His words stand true as ever.

Your real enemy is not actually other people, but the remarkable self-deception that has overtaken our minds. Its horsemen are malice, contempt, and self-righteousness. May we uproot these dark tendencies in ourselves so that we may join the fight against it — the only fight that ultimately matters.

> *Nail on the head brother. My most recent mushroom trip (also the largest dose I've ever taken) I became fixated on a news story I had heard that week. About an 8 year old girl from a tribe in the Amazon, who was tied to a tree and burned alive in order to scare her people off their land so it could be logged. I realized that at the moment he did it, whoever lit that gasoline actually felt / thought more or less okay about what he was doing. **And my mind was illuminated with dozens of the parallels between that man's malformed, horrific perceptual / behavioral state, and mine. I saw the same mistakes in value attribution, the same willful ignorance of the consequences of my acts and words. And there was nothing I could do to deny the similarity.***
