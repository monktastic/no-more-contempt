We each have our own ideas about "what's wrong with the world," and who is responsible. When we think about them, we tend to feel contempt. It seems like a healthy way to affirm our values, convey our disapproval, and deter others from similar misbehavior — in other words, to help us "fight evil" and save the world.

But what if it is a trap?

Contempt[^contempt] actually has a sinister origin, and produces far-ranging toxic effects that are not only invisible to us, but carefully _hidden_ from us by our own minds. It fosters the very conditions in which the problems we decry are all but inevitable. At the micro level, it results in bitter divorces in which each side feels like the exclusive victim / hero; and at the macro level, it explains why the US is headed toward civil war despite nobody recognizing their own complicity. On an even greater scale, it begins to look like that archetypal "evil global conspiracy" that captures our collective imagination.

It is imperative that we discover this trick by which our mind hides the true source and effects of our behavior — not only for our own sake, but the world's. When it is fully unveiled, the problems of the world — and their solutions — begin to look radically different.

## Radical kindness

When wise people urge compassion for evildoers, they're not suggesting that we be _nice._ They're warning us that the only other option is to be — and spread — _evil_.



---

People are _ridiculously_ sensitive to our motivations (if only subconsciously), and malice makes us appear subtly (or not-so-subtly) evil to them. This triggers exactly the same reaction in "bad people" that their apparent evil does in us: it evokes malice, which makes them look even more evil to us, leading to a downward spiral into Hell. It doesn't require physical violence; it can be kicked off by a dehumanizing gaze.

Malicious intent makes us look evil because it _is_: it is secretly designed to darken the world while giving us plausible deniability. We were only "fighting evil" — and how could that ever be wrong? We don't even have to be talking _to_ our target: simply by talking _about_ them with malice, we are inducing hatred in the world in the name of good.

If we could see how dark this really is, we would be unable to do it. It is only possible because we carefully hide the full extent of the _wrongness_ from ourselves. But such self-deception is precisely how "bad people" are able to do what _they_ do: part of them knows perfectly well that what they are doing is wrong, but that _wrongness_ is cleverly hidden from conscious self-reflection.

It is this shadowy state of mind that ultimately enables _all_ evil. If we (the "good people") can't see how easily we are seduced by it, how do we expect them (the "bad people") to? The truth is, we don't.

Our self-image prevents us from admitting that we have anything in common with them, and so instead of recognizing their behavior as self-deceptive — which could actually help them and the world — we perceive them as _fundamentally defective_, so that we can behave maliciously, thus doing our part to keep them trapped in their delusion.

<p align="center" width="100%"><img width="300px" src="img/devil-vs-devil.png"></p>

In other words, our very identity as one of the (precious few) "good people" battling the hordes of evil ensures that we subconsciously behave in ways that keep that battle alive. It doesn't even require seeing people as "evil": simply by feeling malice, hatred, contempt, or even self-righteousness, our minds are cleverly plotting a way to darken the world for our (supposed) benefit.

We _must_ stop doing this.

## Angels and Devils

> _And no wonder, for even Satan masquerades as an angel of light._ —2 Corinthians 11:14

You know the classic image of the angel and devil sitting on our shoulders? It's _almost_ accurate, except for two things. First, the angel isn't really external to you, but represents the deepest aspect of your mind; your fundamentally compassionate nature. In a deep sense, it *is* you. The devil is external; a kind of parasite[^intrinsic]. But it doesn't just whisper obviously-bad ideas in your ear; it pretends to be your inner angel, and alters your very perception so that certain evils appear unerringly righteous.

<p align="center" width="100%"><img width="300px" src="img/parasite.png"></p>

One of its tricks is to make people appear subhuman, so that harming them feels okay[^subhuman]. Your morals (and social norms) act as a kind of buffer, preventing you from seeing most people this way. But it's always on the hunt for victims, and it only needs the slightest excuse to begin its manipulation.

> _Be kind, for everyone you meet is fighting a great battle._ —Author unknown

It searches for people whose misbehavior can't be chalked up to any kind of "great battle" — the "bad people." Your angel knows that if you look deeply enough, you will _always_ find a kind of battle — and that this will prevent you from hating them, even if you must fiercely fight them. So your devil does something clever: it makes you perceive their devil as _intrinsic_ to their minds. You will then see them as _fundamentally bad_ or _defective_ — and therefore subhuman and worthy of harm.

This is the wedge it drives to prevent your angel from getting an empathetic grip. It triggers behavior that will cause you both to rapidly accelerate away from any possibility of mutual humanizing. Both your devil and theirs _knew_ this would happen, because they are fundamentally identical. In fact, not only are they identical, but from a certain perspective they behave more like puppets of a single shared Devil that is pulling _all_ of our strings.

<p align="center" width="100%"><img width="300px" src="img/shared-devil.png"></p>

This is not just a religious invention: it seems that everyone who introspects carefully enough eventually perceives this "distributed malevolent entity" with a seeming intelligence and volition of its own that, even if not _literally_ true, explain its apparently-coordinated behavior terrifyingly well. Your interaction with the "bad person" ripples out from each of you into your lives, eventually reaching the far corners of the world — where you can plausibly deny any connection to it.

## An "evil conspiracy"

This is that primordial "evil global conspiracy"; the one to which all the rest ultimately owe their existence — and _we_ are its secret minions. It isn't being run by a group of people; it lives in *all* of our minds. Every attempt to maliciously subdue it "out there" just strengthens it, because such behavior is only ever initiated _by_ it — though it makes us believe it was our (righteous) idea.

To be clear: there may well be groups of particularly "bad" people who conspire to cause great harm, but their existence wouldn't be possible if vast numbers of us weren't continually tilling the soil of self-deception — and conversely, it is _inevitable_ given that we are. **We must hold such people accountable** — but when we do this with contempt, we are reinforcing the conditions that effectively _compel_ their existence. (And, horrible as it is to admit, something in our minds is doing this _on purpose_, so that we always have someone to point our fingers at.)

<p align="center" width="100%"><img width="300px" src="img/evil-conspiracy.png"></p>

_Any_ time you feel malice, contempt, or self-righteousness toward another being; any time you see them as fundamentally defective or inferior; you are being tricked into spreading evil in some way that you can't yet see. These are all forms of self-deception, and secretly invite more self-deception in others — that shadowy space of mind in which evil can be "safely" committed.

Your true enemy isn't other people, but the parasite manipulating _all_ of our minds. The greatest gift you can give the world is healing yourself of it. The more this infection clears up, the more you see how it infects other minds, and the more you can do about it.

This brings you closer to your "angel"; the only thing that can truly evict anyone's "devil." It is not weak, and it's not always nice. It can take any form needed to defeat evil, including violence[^dalai-lama-gun] and even _apparent_ contempt. The one thing it never does is lead you into that illusion from which you _pretend_ to be doing good while secretly causing mayhem.

This is also called compassion. It doesn't always know what the most beneficial behavior is. That requires _wisdom_. Developing wisdom is a vast topic, and beyond the scope of this work. Compassion simply ensures that you are, indeed, behaving in a way that is aligned with your deepest values; your profound love for the world. People can sense your underlying motivation even when you think they can't, and it makes more difference than you can fathom.

The first time you see this, you will be brought to your knees in abject agony over the horror that you've been inadvertently been perpetrating on the world — especially as you discover that part of you has _always_ known what you've really been doing.

The more compassion is unveiled, the more it reveals the vast interconnectedness not only of humanity, but of all of reality. This is fully revealed only upon enlightenment — though [we can all sense it](../unity.md) to a greater or lesser degree at all times. From here, malice and contempt are literally impossible. The better you understand people's confused minds, the less you can hate them.

Enlightenment is a lofty goal, but we can start small, by changing social norms. We can teach our children (and remind our allies) that contempt for "bad people" isn't what it seems to be. It must go the way of all other forms of evil if we are to defeat our true enemy.

## Notes

*It is surely the case that some people are so far gone that our fledgling attempts to be compassionate can backfire. This isn't because compassion is the wrong intention, but because we haven't developed it deeply enough yet to be authentic (along with the wisdom to employ it). This is a deep and difficult issue, and beyond the scope of this piece.*

## Footnotes

[^contempt]: Specifically, it is contempt for *people* that is wrong. Contempt for ideas or behaviors can actually be healthy.

[^intrinsic]: You may wonder how it is possible to know that evil is not intrinsic to other people's minds, but for our purposes it's more important to see that (1) our _perception_ of their intrinsic defectiveness is our own projection, and (2) our own darkness gives us the capacity to devolve into a condition in which others would be utterly convinced that _ours_ is intrinsic.

[^subhuman]: Notice that genocides can only be perpetrated when the victims are seen as subhuman. The Nazis referred to Jews as 'vermin,' and during the genocide in Rwanda, Tutsis were referred to as 'cockroaches.' This is a common pattern throughout history.

[^dalai-lama-gun]: The Dalai Lama was once asked what you should do if a gunman is trying to shoot you and you have a gun. [He said "shoot back."](https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/dalai-gun/)
