Kindness is the hardest word to define, but also the most important. It doesn't mean being nice. Nice means pleasant and agreeable; fine qualities that are nonetheless unhelpful sometimes. Kindness means something much more profound. It is the right motivation in literally _every_ circumstance. But how could kindness be the correct response to evil?

---

Our usual instinct is to be nasty to perpetrators. We may have the good sense not to be overtly cruel, but we often can't help but inject at least a _little_ bit of darkness into our interactions. We reason that as long as it produces a positive outcome — such as suppressing their misbehavior — that it's not really dark in the first place. It must therefore be good. And what could be wrong with harboring a bit of malice or contempt in our hearts, anyway? They're private feelings with no external effect. But part of us knows this story is a sham. Something in us is secretly trying to _provoke_ the darkness in our enemies. We tell ourselves that we're just exposing the evil already there, for all the world to see, but the truth is that we are knowingly driving it deeper _into_ their minds, thereby birthing new evil into the world. Yet we must never admit this to ourselves, because the whole point of this ruse is to prove that we're the good guys — and what kind of good guy would knowingly create evil?

The fascinating part is _how_ we drive the darkness deeper in. Simply by harboring malice — whether we're conscious of it or not — we're signaling to our enemy that we're under the malevolent sway of the very thing that we're viciously judging _them_ for; and moreover, that we _know_ this, but are incapable of admitting it. We're secretly inviting them to perceive us as evil — but we've built an airtight defense against this accusation, and so it only proves our point: that they must be _fundamentally_ defective, and must be stopped at any cost. Our hidden goal is to prove that the darkness exists only in other people, so that we have something external to blame for the sorry state of the world, and don't have to confront our own complicity. This doesn't even require outright malice, per se. Simply by perceiving ourselves as _intrinsically_ superior to others; seeing them as _fundamentally_ defective — i.e., contempt — we set this process in motion.

This is impossibly dark behavior, and yet we never recognize it as such. Or more precisely, part of us _does_ recognize it, but we don't let this knowledge reach conscious awareness. It turns out this is the secret mechanism behind _all the evil there ever was_. "Bad people" know perfectly well when they are doing wrong, but this knowledge is carefully shielded from conscious self-reflection, so that it doesn't _feel_ wrong. In this shadowy state, we are capable of anything. The reason we hate others for it is not to expose or subdue their darkness — like we tell ourselves — but to get them to suppress it even harder while blaming it on them, making them appear even more obviously defective, so that we can better hide our own darkness from ourselves.

This is how evil spreads, with nobody recognizing their own complicity. In this state, cruelty becomes righteous, and we inevitably overlook the harmful and self-serving aspects of our own actions and agendas. This is what the darkness is ultimately trying to achieve: a world in which it has complete dominion, tricking us all into continually empowering it while flawlessly convinced that we're fighting it. It is like a living organism, keeping itself alive is by hiding itself in the shadows of our minds. When it invariably emerges, it cleverly masquerades as our inner Light. It makes us violently judge others for falling victim to this obvious trap, while preventing us from noticing that this very attitude is proof that we're caught in it ourselves. We're convinced that we're fighting evil, but our darkness is actually telegraphing itself to our enemies in order to _resonate_ with theirs, in a kind of secret handshake. We may be enemies on the surface, but under the covers, our darkness is secretly allied.

This is why we sometimes fear the existence of an evil global conspiracy running the world from behind the scenes. The darkness in our minds is indeed conspiring, together behaving like a singular _distributed malevolent entity_, manipulating all of humanity from beneath our conscious thresholds. The Christians know it as the Devil, and the Buddhists call it the ego. You can treat it as a metaphor, but it is also as real as anything you can touch. It is the _primordial_ evil conspiracy; the one to which all the rest owe their existence, and to which they ultimately filter up. The reason we never seem able to fully unveil it is that it lives deep within the crevices of our own minds. It keeps our attention fixated perpetually outward, on the evil "out there," so that we will never look "in here," at the one place where we can actually defeat it. Every attempt to subdue it externally without being free of it internally only ends up creating more, often in invisible ways. There is no way around this.

Kindness is any behavior that brings the darkness to Light, and evil is anything that hides it. Every act of unkindness is secretly an attempt to drive other people's self-deception deeper into their minds, and is therefore evil. If you are perceptive enough while behaving this way, you will discover that you somehow already knew this, but couldn't admit it to yourself. It is itself an act of profound self-deception; of hiding from your Light. This alone would have told you that it would only produce more evil, no matter how convincingly it claims otherwise. Every time any one of us makes this mistake, we unwittingly induce the same tendency in everyone else. It is _infectious_. The "trick" to remaining kind — if you can call it that — is to never depart from your inner Light under any circumstances. If there is even a trace of malice, contempt, or self-righteousness anywhere in your heart, it _will_ leak into the world — and part of you will always know it.

It is entirely possible to fight evil without making this tragic mistake. But to do that, there's something we must see first.

There can be moments in life — such as during psychedelic trips, near-death experiences, or deep meditation or prayer — when you are confronted with the full depths of your own self-deception. You are shown every single instance where you skirted your conscience in any way; every act of lying to yourself for your own personal gain. You are brought face-to-face with all the harm you've ever perpetrated since time immemorial, and it is far more than you could hope to clean up in a single lifetime. The pain is beyond what you can fathom, or think you can bear. How widely and quickly it spread! How many it affected! The darkness exploited your fear and pride, enabling you to do things you otherwise couldn't if only you had been seeing clearly.

But slowly, it dawns on you: the reason it hurts so much is that you never actually wanted to do this. It is only profound confusion that enabled it. Your then absorb your whole being into that part of you that never wanted to hurt anyone; never _could_ want such a thing. And then it happens: the full mass of darkness suddenly lifts from your mind. It feels exactly like you'd imagine being freed of a demonic possession. Beneath it is a Light so vast that it defies description; an infinite Love for all of reality that excludes nothing and forsakes no-one — including the targets of its fearsome wrath, should that be necessary. You never truly departed from your Light; never could, because you _are_ the Light — and, astonishingly, so is everyone else.

In fact, you _are_ everyone and everything else, just pretending that you're not. One consciousness, peering out through countless eyes. There are many ways to say this, all of which sound absurd to the rational mind. But when you fully unveil the Light in yourself, you automatically see it in everyone else — including those who seemed not to have any. This is what the darkness is trying to hide. Everything we do to each other — or to Nature herself — we ultimately do to ourselves. How crazy to think otherwise! How foolish to judge others for not seeing it, when we weren't able to see it yet ourselves! Such a silly game we play, with such tragic consequences. We are continually shoving other versions of ourselves into the abyss, to keep the game going, because we're not ready to wake up ourselves. We lose the desire to "get away" with anything, because the whole idea is exposed as ridiculous. The Light is _everywhere._ The sooner we own up to our misdeeds, the better for everyone.

The strangest part is discovering how you simultaneously _knew_ this and yet somehow _didn't_. You convinced yourself that your unkind behavior was "for the greater good," even as you knew better. You could always perceive the inner Light in the "bad people," and you chose to smother it anyway — knowing that if you compartmentalized this knowledge carefully enough, nobody could blame you for it, because _you yourself_ would no longer know. Yet others could somehow sense what you were doing, and it gave them a chance to pin the evils of the world on you. It is only now that you see that they were only lost in the same confusion that you were, that you are able to truly forgive them. You discover the surprising sense in which nobody actually _wants_ to harbor the darkness — or rather, how their apparent desire to harbor it is simply a reflection of our own desperate need to project our own darkness into the souls of others. We should practically thank them for accepting that role.

You see for the first time _how_ others could sense what you were really doing, despite your astonishingly clever attempts to hide it. At the very deepest level, your mind is not truly separate from theirs, or from the world at large. It's not that others can read your mind, per se, but your deepest motivations invariably weave themselves into the very fabric of your "outer" reality; the two being fundamentally inseparable. The deepest choice of all is whether to stand firm in your Light or give in to the impostor. It is a choice you make in every moment, whether you know it or not — and the cumulative result determines your ultimate impact on the world. Others can sense your choices at a subconscious level, and they subtly influence their own. Our culture has convinced itself that this is mystical nonsense, despite it being right under our noses. We do this so that we can harbor our demons while pretending this has no consequences. The more we heal, the more this worldview evaporates.

There is no way to force others to see any of this; force being a manifestation of the same fundamental mistake. Those who are most powerful at inducing this realization in others are simply those who hold it most strongly themselves. They are literally incapable of feeling malice, contempt, or self-righteousness, having thoroughly seen through them as horsemen of the darkness. Yet they are not weak. They are unafraid to fiercely confront the darkness in others. Being free of it themselves, they are immune to its charms. This enables their accusations to penetrate other minds, instead of being deflected by the defense mechanisms that the rest of us normally trigger — again, inadvertently, but in another sense, intentionally. Their attack therefore finds its mark — which is the darkness itself, and not the confused being who unwittingly harbors it — even if the being needs to be harmed in the process. This is all very difficult to describe, but part of you knows exactly what I mean. 

In the same way that your darkness can extend a secret handshake to theirs, your Light can do the same. It is nowhere near as violently pleasurable as provoking the darkness, but infinitely more valuable. This process can take a long time to unfold, and require many iterations — but it is the _only_ way that darkness is released from our world.

If we ultimately are the Light, how on Earth did we get to this place that looks nothing like it? This process is extremely tricky to convey, because it doesn't fit into our culture's standard metaphysics. You could say it all began with a subtle turn away from the Light. Then, fearing that we'd lost contact with our _absolute_ goodness, we went out seeking for it _relatively_ — that is, at the expense of apparent "others." We felt that we had to make them _bad_, and then violently defeat them, to earn our way back to our original goodness. But this just made things worse, and it quickly spiraled out of control. This is the apparent reality in which we now live.

The hardest thing to communicate about this story is that it does not unfold in what we normally conceive of as linear time. In a profound and surprising sense, every moment is the very first. Thus, every instant is an opportunity to rediscover our primordial Home, a place we never truly left. Each time we see this, we increasingly discover how our judgements of others are actually pointers back to an unhealed part of ourselves. As we heal ourselves, we discover how to heal our relationship with the "other," until it slowly dawns on us that there was never truly an "other." The more we see this, the more we vow to hold the Light for these seeming others, even when — indeed, _especially_ when — they cannot hold it for themselves. Far from being a burden, we discover that this has always been our true purpose; our deepest calling. Every encounter with evil becomes an opportunity to strengthen our commitment to the Light.

Looked at this way, kindness is anything that brings us all closer to remembering the truth, and evil is anything that pushes us away from it. Forsaking others is thus always a form of evil. It is a form of forsaking ourselves, because we are not ready to come Home yet. If this language feels too religious for you, feel free to find your own framing. In the end, there is only one truth anyway.

Unlike the Light, the darkness is not a real entity. It is an absence, not a presence. It is merely our willingness to turn away from our Light, instead listening to our agendas and justifications. As such, it can never be defeated by more absence. Yet make no mistake: although it is an absence, it still behaves like a sinister presence; a parasite of the mind. The darkness you see your enemies is the very _same_ entity in your mind that provokes you into seeing theirs as intrinsic. It manipulates your perception at such a fundamental level that you simply cannot fathom that you're being fooled. You're certain that you're seeing reality _as it is_. It is an _impossibly_ clever trick.

It is difficult to overstate just how much of our civilization is built on the shaky foundations of our aggregate self-deception. Every time any one of us skirts our conscience in any way, we contribute to the universal bank of darkness. Revenge fantasy films, YouTube videos of "Karens getting owned," vicious Facebook threads full of casual cruelty — each is a breeding ground for our collective demons. It all seeps into our physical reality, poisoning it. Everything from our unhealthy air, water, and soil, to our myriad societal ills and the climate crisis, is ultimately an external manifestation of a sickness within. As long as we perceive this sickness to exist only in others, we will never discover the hidden aspect of our own minds that secretly enables it, continually confusing our contempt for our authentic good. This is in no way suggesting that we are all equally complicit, by any stretch of the imagination. Nonetheless, we each have a profound role to play in leading the world back to the Light.

We've been led astray by a society that points us in precisely the wrong direction to accomplish this, although that is nobody's fault in particular. Our power does not lie in lording our superiority over others — including the "bad people" — but in discovering our surprising commonality with them. This is not some kumbaya sentiment, either. Again, genuine kindness has nothing to do with being nice. It can be fierce or even violent if necessary. It can take almost any form at all. Its only defining characteristic is that it is utterly free of self-deception. It does not misperceive evil as being intrinsic to any mind, and this seemingly-subtle change makes all the difference. The profound integrity of this act prevents the darkness in others from finding the "hook" in our own that it would normally use to justify itself, and is thereby weakened. Although we may still be enemies on the surface, our Light is becoming allied. We are beginning to remember how this whole game actually works.

To be clear: it does no good to pretend that you can see the Light in others when you can't. Doing so can backfire miserably. Thus, both pretending to see the Light and overlooking it are harmful. The only solution is to learn to actually see it, which happens naturally as you uncover your own. Similarly, it is astonishingly easy to lie to ourselves about whether our violent behavior is genuinely kind or merely self-deception. This is how the darkness sneaks in. Perhaps the clearest measure of our own ability to deceive ourselves is how much contempt we are able to muster for our enemies; the "bad people." To the degree that this potential is present, we are susceptible to sliding down the dark path that has enabled every atrocity there ever was, without ever realizing that we've done so. All that is required is the right — or wrong — confluence of circumstances. This happens faster than you can imagine, and you _do not_ want to find yourself there. You _will_ have to confront it, sooner or later.

Everything you do makes a difference, in ways that you can hardly fathom. There are vast and subtle networks of causality that we are normally unconscious of, and that secretly drive the fate of the world. If we pay attention only to the surface activity, we miss out on the bulk of what actually shapes our reality. Evil can look sweet and pretty, while kindness may look nothing like our naive interpretations of it. It is impossible to know which is which — and easy to convince ourselves otherwise — until we have done the deep inner work that eradicates the core confusion. We each catch glimpses from time to time, and it is our duty to carry those glimpses into the world as best we are able. I wish I could tell you that I have completed the journey myself, but alas, I am a mere fledgling. I am still liable to mess things up royally, and I hope you will hold my feet to the fire when I do. I promise to do the same for you.

May all beings be free from suffering and its causes. Amen.
