> _For so long as the root of wickedness is hidden, it is strong. But when it is recognized, it is dissolved. When it is revealed, it perishes. ... It is powerful because we have not recognized it._ — The Gospel of Philip

Why is evil so hard to eradicate? The truth is that something within us is secretly fighting to keep it alive. Until we finally confront that part of ourselves, the evil can only continue to grow.

---

Consider [this horrifying story from 2012](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/southamerica/brazil/9005835/Loggers-burned-Amazon-tribe-girl-alive.html):

> _Loggers in Brazil captured an eight-year-old girl from one of the Amazon's last uncontacted tribes and burned her alive as part of a campaign to force the indigenous population from its land [...]_

<p align="center" width="100%"><img width="300px" src="img/tribe.png"></p>

Can you feel the profound anger and heartbreak for the girl, her tribe, and humanity? It makes you want to do everything in your power to ensure this kind of thing never happens again — including punishing and maybe even harming the perpetrators. At the same time, you may feel a desire to harm them quite _independently_ of any good it will bring: pure old-fashioned vengeance.

What is it that makes us feel contempt and malice for perpetrators? Why do those emotions feel so _righteous?_ It feels like we've finally grabbed a hold of a bit of evil, and we're not going to let it escape this time. No, we're going to make sure it is _punished_.

This is the story we tell ourselves, but underneath the surface, something _much_ darker is going on...

"Evil" isn't actually a _presence_; it is an _absence_. The absence of what?

Think back on a time when you skirted your conscience, pretending either that you couldn't hear it or that you could safely ignore it. Part of you _knew_ that you were doing something wrong, but you somehow hid it from yourself. Try to recall what that state was like. It is a kind of self-deception. It is this same mechanism that allows the "bad people" to do what _they_ do without remorse.

Evil is the absence of the "light of consciousness" that would otherwise shine within our mind, forcing us to fully confront our misbehavior — and thus preventing us from continuing.

It's not that "bad people" don't know that what they're doing is wrong. Part of them knows perfectly well. They may even be able to say so. And yet the _wrongness_; the full implications of their behavior, are being carefully shielded from conscious self-reflection. It is a schism in the mind.

We might think that the more egregious someone's behavior, the more obvious it would be to them, but actually the opposite is true: the worse the misbehavior, the _harder_ it is being hidden; the _less_ accessible it is to the part of them that would put an end to it, if only it knew.

From the outside, this profound self-deception looks _evil_. We may want to blame them for engaging in it, but before we do, there's something that we must understand about ourselves.

---

We ourselves have a tremendous capacity for self-deception. In fact, a simple test of your own capacity is how much contempt you are able to feel for the "bad people."

Why?

Contempt is the feeling that you are intrinsically better than others: not merely that you hold better views or behave better than them, but that they are somehow _fundamentally morally defective_, and thus completely unlike you.

It is a lie. When you become free of self-deception, you are able to perceive — not just believe, but _perceive_ — how it enables _all_ misbehavior. But people wouldn't need to shield things from themselves if they were fundamentally defective. They only need to do it because there is, indeed, a part of them that doesn't _want_ to be doing it. We are not, in fact, "fundamentally" better than them.

We don't become fully conscious of this until _enlightenment_, but part of us can sense it long before then. It may not feel like we can, but if not, it's only because of the presence of a powerful self-deception within ourselves.

Part of you knows that you yourself are capable of unspeakable horror under the right circumstances. Contempt is the tool that your mind employs to keep this awful truth hidden from you. By seeing others as fundamentally different, you are free to dehumanize them, and to treat them in ways that will _deepen_ their capacity for self-deception — thus reinforcing your perception that you are different.

Unfortunately, the more you engage in this, the more _similar_ you actually become...

---

To take a simple example, consider what happens when we mock our political opponents. Don't they just dig in their heels, see _us_ as evil, and vow to fight harder? We tell ourselves that we had "good intentions" (to shut them up; force them to introspect; convince others not to join them, etc.), but the truth is that something in us _wants_ more polarization, to remind ourselves of how "good" we are — and we _will_ get what we want.

If you look carefully at your mind while doing this, you can actually _feel_ yourself gleefully shoving their minds deeper into the abyss. We derive a kind of malevolent pleasure from it.

As a more extreme example, didn't the architects of the "War on Terror" _know_ that indiscriminately bombing the sh*t out of people would just inspire a new wave of "terrorists" who they would then "unfortunately" have to destroy too? This might have been mixed in with genuinely good intentions (and perhaps even results), but part of them _wanted_ to generate a never-ending supply of "bad guys" who we must righteously destroy.

All one had to do was look in their eyes and _see_ the profound self-deception behind their words to know that this would be the outcome. But it is hard to do this without feeling contempt arising within me. From this dark place, I _will_ create more animosity in the world while patting myself on the back for all the "good" I am doing — and I will have no idea that this is what I am secretly up to.

I'm not making a political statement about the "right" way to address injustices. I don't have a blanket solution to that complex problem. But there is one thing that can be seen directly: _any_ time you feel contempt, your mind is secretly plotting a way to _increase_ the evil in the world while convincing you that it is righteous. That is its _only_ purpose.

In other words, contempt is a form of self-deception. It therefore looks subtly evil to others — because it _is_ — which is why they vow to fight us in return. Do you see how clever this is? We dehumanize others, which looks a little bit evil to them, so that they feel compelled to fight our evil, so that we can ratchet up our dehumanization.

---

When we act maliciously, we secretly have a dual intent. On one hand, we are trying to appear righteous, as though we are fighting evil. On the other hand, part of us is trying to telegraph our own inner darkness to the evildoer — as if to show them that we are capable of everything that they are, and more.

We may not be conscious of this second communication, but our subconscious mind ensures that the message gets through — to our target, our allies, and bystanders alike. It may strike enough fear in our "victim" to pause their misbehavior (in public, anyway), but it also has a deeper effect: it assures them that _darkness is where the power is._ All who witness this behavior will therefore invite the darkness to further colonize their minds. It _will_ manifest in some form or another.

The world becomes darker as a result. We probably won't notice this, but even if we do, we will either blame it on them, or else write it off as "unfortunate" collateral damage. But it isn't actually an unfortunate side effect of our well-intentioned behavior: it was actually the _goal_, and was secretly orchestrated by a sinister aspect within our minds. The way this works is _insanely_ clever.

<p align="center" width="100%">
    <img width="300px" src="img/evil-above-world.png"> 
</p>

People are only able to misbehave due to a kind of self-deception: part of them knows perfectly well when what they're doing is wrong, but that "wrongness" is cleverly hidden from conscious self-reflection. We all know what this state is like: every one of us has skirted our conscience, pretending either that we couldn't hear it or that we could safely ignore it.

Try to recall what that state is like. In that bizarre schism of mind, you simultaneously _know_ and yet somehow _don't_. **This is the secret mechanism behind all the evil there ever was**.

We believe that we can violently force others to own up to their self-deception, but this usually backfires: they simply perceive _us_ as evil in return, and not having the moral authority to be judging anybody. Why on Earth would they feel compelled to repent or even introspect? No; they now feel compelled to violently force us to admit to _our_ evil.

Part of us secretly knew this would happen. In fact, it planned it. We _wanted_ them to react poorly, so that we could prove to ourselves just how bad they are, so that we could unleash more of our righteous fury. Think about it: isn't it much more viscerally satisfying to see bad people "get owned" than to have a change of heart, even if the latter is better for the world? We _want_ a fight.

We aren't telegraphing our darkness to _suppress_ theirs, but to _amplify_ it. If you introspect carefully enough, you can practically _feel_ the darkness in your mind reaching out to give theirs a secret handshake. Part of us knows perfectly well that we are doing this, but we carefully hide it from ourselves. Sound familiar? They weren't exactly _wrong_ to perceive us as "evil" — we are, indeed, caught in precisely the same trap that we are violently judging them for.

If we could just see how easily we deceive ourselves, we would understand the mechanism that enables _all_ misbehavior, and this would empower to do something useful about it. Instead, we continually get sucked into the same trap that humanity has been in for millennia.

It's not _harming_ them that was the problem (because harm is sometimes necessary), but the malice with which we did it. It is entirely possible to harm people out of fierce compassion, but it feels **nothing** like malice: the crucial connection to our Heart has not been severed. Others can sense our profoundly benevolent intent, and this prevents their evil from finding the "hook" that it uses to justify itself. Instead, it is confronted with a blinding Light that can only weaken it, if only imperceptibly — the _true_ "righteousness" that we thought we were accessing through malice.

<p align="center" width="100%">
    <img width="300px" src="img/devil-vs-devil.png"> 
</p>

If it is really this simple, then why haven't we (as a species) figured it out and changed our ways?

Part of us _knows_ that we're not intrinsically better than anyone — but given how low people can sink, this is painful to admit, so we hide it from ourselves. We use malice to keep people trapped in delusion, so that we can prove our morally superiority. Unfortunately, shoving people into Hell is hardly "morally superior," so we hide this intention from ourselves, too. This results in an ever-tightening noose of deception that collapses in on itself like a black hole, preventing us from ever suspecting what we're really doing. We are in too deep.

That's why revenge fantasy films like _The Equalizer_ are so popular: they exist only to keep us firmly ensconced in this warm delusion where we are the immaculate "good guys" fighting the hordes of pure evil "out there." Think of them as physical manifestations of our collective shadow.

    <br/>
    <em>... only *good* consequences, we swear!</em>
</p>

If we travel far enough down this dark path, we will eventually lose even the _pretense_ of being good. That's where the "evil people" are trapped. We ourselves are profoundly susceptible to this slippery slope, whether we like to admit it or not — and the only way to protect against it is to recognize how it works. This is also the only way to free others, instead of mindlessly perpetuating the trap.

> _And no wonder, for even Satan masquerades as an angel of light._ —2 Corinthians 11:14

You know the classic image of the angel and devil sitting on our shoulders? It's _almost_ accurate, except for two things. First, the angel isn't really external to you, but represents your true nature as compassion. In a deep sense, it *is* you. The devil is external; a kind of parasite[^intrinsic]. But it doesn't just whisper obviously-bad ideas in your ear; it alters your very perception and pretends to be your inner angel.

<p align="center" width="100%">
    <img width="300px" src="img/parasite.png"> 
</p>

> _Be kind, for everyone you meet is fighting a great battle._ —Author unknown

Your angel already knows all this, and that even the most "evil" person is merely under the sway of a powerful parasite; one held in place by some "battle" invisible not only to you, but probably even to them. As hard as it may be to evict theirs, it's never _impossible._ But your devil makes it _appear_ impossible; as though their evil is intrinsic. This way, they seem _fundamentally defective_, and therefore worthy of malice.

Your devil knows that this dehumanization will appear evil to others — because it is the very _essence_ of evil — and so it knows that it will trigger the same reflex in them. It knows this because your devil and theirs are identical. They are working in tandem, each provoking the other.

In fact, it turns out they're more than just identical: if you look carefully, you will see that they are more like outgrowths of a single dark collective entity that is continually manipulating _all_ of our minds — the Devil, if you will.

<p align="center" width="100%">
    <img width="300px" src="img/shared-devil.png"> 
</p>

This is not just a wacky religious invention: anyone who introspects carefully enough eventually perceives this "distributed malevolent entity" with an apparent intelligence and volition of its own that, even if not _literally_ true, explain its seemingly-coordinated behavior terrifyingly well.

This "being" continually drives humanity toward various kinds of Armageddon: situations in which everyone is violently proving just how righteous they are. It is why the US is headed toward civil war without anyone recognizing their own complicity, and it explains bitter [divorces](https://www.gottman.com/blog/this-one-thing-is-the-biggest-predictor-of-divorce/) in which each side feels like the exclusive victim / hero. Nearly the whole world is caught in its terrible sway, evil provoking "righteous" retribution at every turn without anyone ever noticing the true source of it all.

This is that primordial "evil global conspiracy" to which all the rest ultimately owe their existence — and _we_ are its unwitting minions. Every attempt to maliciously subdue it "out there" just strengthens it, because such behavior is only ever initiated _by_ it — though it makes us believe that it was initiated by us.

**Any** time you feel malice, hatred, contempt, or even self-righteousness toward another being; any time you see them as fundamentally defective or inferior; any time you are tempted to divide the world into the (fundamentally) "good" and "bad," or to forsake anyone, you are feeding the Beast.

<p align="center" width="100%"><img width="300px" src="img/good-vs-bad.png"></p>

To be clear: there are surely groups of particularly deluded people who conspire to cause great harm, but their existence wouldn't be possible if the rest of us weren't feeding the source — and conversely, it is _completely inevitable_ given that we are. **We must hold such people accountable**, but when we do this with contempt, we are reinforcing the very conditions that _compel_ their existence.

If you could trace all the subtle threads of causality weaving through the world, you would find your finger in countless evil pies.

<p align="center" width="100%">

</p>

Our true enemy is not other people, but the dark "entity" that has captured _all_ of our minds. By keeping our attention fixated perpetually outward, it ensures that we never introspect deeply enough to discover our own complicity in keeping it alive.

This is roughly what the Buddhists call the ego: the collection of habits we have developed to overlook our intimate interconnection with all of reality; to elevate ourselves at its expense. The reason it is so hard to discover is that it [pretends to _be_ you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gg8JYYyWSPg) — but it is not your friend.

> *The shadow is a moral problem that challenges the whole ego-personality, for no one can become conscious of the shadow without considerable moral effort. To become conscious of it involves recognizing the dark aspects of the personality as present and real. This act is the essential condition for any kind of self-knowledge.* —Carl Jung

The only way out of this trap is to see beyond the ego, to your fundamentally compassionate nature. When you see this, you cannot help but see it in everyone else, too — because in an astonishing and heart-wrenching sense, [they **are** you](unity.md). This perception is not fully unveiled until enlightenment, but we can all taste it at all times. Ultimately, all self-deception boils down to willful ignorance of this fact — and all unkindness reinforces it. Why do I say "willful" ignorance? Because you eventually discover that _part of you has known this all along._ Think of this piece as a reminder.

From that clarity of perception, you cannot possibly harbor malice or contempt. You see it for the utter nonsense that it is. This enables you to perceive the hidden causes of people's self-deception, allowing you to do something real about it. That's what compassion (aka kindness) is.

To repeat: it doesn't mean being _nice_. It can outwardly be as fierce (or violent[^dalai-lama-gun], or even _apparently_ contemptuous) as the situation warrants, but these behaviors come from a completely different source, and have a completely different effect on all minds involved — rippling outward into the world in ways that we can't see or predict. Your refusal to join the darkness — especially when it is most tempting — serves as a powerful example for all of humanity.

_This_ is why wise people urge compassion for evildoers: the only alternative is to join them in evil.

To be clear, compassion doesn't always know what the most beneficial behavior _is_; it merely ensures that you are not falling into the many seductive traps of your darkness. Determining the most effective behavior requires _wisdom_, which is a vast topic, and beyond the scope of this work. Compassion may be no easier to acquire than wisdom, but it is much simpler: there is a single place within your mind that you can turn to and _know_ whether you are allying with the darkness or the Light.

So much trouble could be avoided if we just remembered to **look** — especially when we were most convinced that we didn't need to.

> *Such a man knows that whatever is wrong in the world is also in himself, and if he only learns to deal with his own shadow, he has done something real for the world. He has succeeded in shouldering at least an infinitesimal part of the gigantic, unsolved problems of our day.* —Carl Jung

<p align="center" width="100%">
    <img width="600px" src="img/buddha-and-demons.png"> 
</p>

Enlightenment may be a lofty goal to expect of humanity, but we can start small, by changing social norms. We can teach our children the difference between "kind" and "nice," and explain the sense in which kindness is _always_ the right motivation in all circumstances. We can refuse to join our allies when they're caught up in the traps of contempt and malice, and serve as an example of a better way.

Please never lose contact with your Heart. It is the greatest gift you have to offer this weary world.

## Footnotes

[^contempt]: Specifically, we mean (genuine) contempt for *people*. Contempt for ideas or behaviors can actually be healthy, as perhaps can (apparent) contempt that is rooted in genuine compassion.

[^intrinsic]: You may wonder how it is possible to know that evil is not intrinsic to other people's minds, but for our purposes it's more important to see that (1) our _perception_ of their intrinsic defectiveness is our own projection, and (2) our own darkness gives us the capacity to devolve into a condition in which others would be utterly convinced that _ours_ is intrinsic.

[^dalai-lama-gun]: The Dalai Lama was once asked what you should do if a gunman is trying to shoot you and you have a gun. [He said "shoot back."](https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/dalai-gun/)
