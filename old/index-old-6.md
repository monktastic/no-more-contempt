What if nearly everything you're doing to "fight evil" is secretly strengthening it — and moreover, what if part of you already knows this, but is actively concealing it from your conscious mind? 

[//]: # (Upon seeing this, you would suddenly lose the ability to contemptuously judge anybody — and paradoxically, it is precisely this lack of contempt that would enable you to be of genuine service in fighting evil.)

[//]: # (There's an insidious mechanism that prevents us from consciously confronting the full implications of our behavior. It is only once we see this that we begin to understand the secret mechanism behind _all_ evil. Until then, we have no hope of defeating it. We can only amplify it.)

[//]: # (The Devil hides in the very last place you would ever look.)

Take a moment to reflect on what's wrong with the world, and bring to mind the people responsible. Don't they seem not only morally defective, but somehow _fundamentally_ so? Do you feel contempt for them, or maybe even malice? Such people cannot be helped; they can only be subdued or punished. It feels like contempt exists to help us accomplish this and thereby improve the world, but this is a sinister lie. It exists only to shield you from something your subconscious is secretly doing: preparing to _darken_ the world in a way that appears "righteous."

[//]: # (justify behaviors that will elevate or otherwise enrich you at the world's expense — and to make you feel _righteous_ about it.)

This is not something I can convince you of, so I won't even try. But here's the crazy thing: part of you already knows it. You don't enjoy mocking or shaming your enemies to help them (or anyone else) "see the light," or to make the world a better place. You do it to make yourself feel superior. It may temporarily suppress their misbehavior (in public, anyway), but it _will_ increase the net hostility and polarization in the world. You may tell yourself that it won't, or that it's their fault if it does, or that the benefits still outweigh the drawbacks, but part of you knows that these are just lame excuses for malicious behavior.

To be clear, it's not that shame and mockery can't be helpful. They probably can — but when they're motivated by contempt, a deep part of us isn't actually _trying_ to help. It has a much darker goal in mind, and is actively shielding you from consciously recognizing this.

A deep aspect of our minds needs to see ourselves as special. For some people this may be about accumulating wealth or having the "right" skin color, and in others it is simply about being a "good person." This causes us to perceive others in whatever way necessary to justify behavior that will bolster our self-image. For "good people," our subconscious is on the prowl for anyone we can plausibly label as "bad" — and who we can then _make worse_, by engaging in behaviors that appear righteous on the surface. We _intentionally_ trigger their defense mechanisms, so as to reinforce their self-deceptive capacities while giving us plausible deniability. This creates _more_ evil while giving the convincing appearance that we are fighting it. You and they may be enemies in name, but behind the scenes, your darkness is secretly allied.

Of course, you will not (consciously) recognize this — but other people can always tell, if only subconsciously. If they are compassionate and wise, they will sense whatever "great battle" you are internally fighting that is driving this misbehavior, and will help heal it. If they are especially skilled, you won't even know that they're doing this. Their behavior may appear fierce and antagonistic, and look nothing like "compassion" — but you will subconsciously sense that they are not truly enemies. They are firmly connected to their "inner Light," and are inspiring the same in you, whether you know it or not. This _weakens_ your capacity for self-deception; _reduces_ the (apparent) evil in the world.

If they are _not_ compassionate — which is to say, if they are not yet aware of the same dark tendency in themselves that they are violently accusing you of — then it will trigger _their_ darkness in turn. They will treat you with contempt. Far from helping you recognize your misbehavior, this will force your subconscious to mask it even harder. This is exactly what their darkness wants: to trigger your defense mechanisms and make you a slightly worse person, so that their contempt is validated, and "righteous" escalation is justified.

This is the trap in which (almost) the entire world is presently caught.

Your _conscience_ (not to be confused with your _consciousness_) is that part of you that most deeply knows right from wrong. It doesn't always give you such a clear signal, but even when it does, you can choose to override it. We've all done this. We've convinced ourselves that certain behaviors are okay even when we deep down know they're not.

The more we disobey our conscience, the harder it becomes to hear. Its signal very quickly becomes lost in the noise of our minds, and we easily confuse our justifications for its voice. It's not that it has become _quieter_, per se. It is always right there, if we bother to look. But we train ourselves _not_ to look.

We easily forgive ourselves for being in this state, but rarely extend this courtesy to others. Instead, our darkness seizes on the opportunity to identify them as being fundamentally different, and thus worthy of our contempt. It does this so that we can feel good about pushing them further in, thereby further distancing ourselves at their expense. This strengthens the darkness in both them and us — as well as in "allies" and bystanders who witness this dark behavior. But we never notice that we're doing this.

It is true that they've for some reason _chosen_ to ignore their conscience — and therefore ought to be corrected — but everything comes down to how you do so. If you feel even the slightest bit of malice, contempt, or self-righteousness, then you are reinforcing this tendency in them (and yourself). It will feel utterly righteous, but ultimately accomplish exactly the opposite.

As a civilization, we are _pretending_ to be fighting evil, but part of our minds knows that this is just a ruse for secret self-aggrandizement. Nothing will change until we become deeply aware of this.

What does it feel like when your own self-deception mechanism goes offline? It feels exactly like you'd imagine feeling if you were suddenly freed from a demonic possession. You clearly and instantly perceive how this "demon" has very cleverly commandeered people's minds, including your own.

Seeing this all clearly turns your whole world upside-down. We are hating people for their susceptibility to the world's most fiendish mind-virus — the one responsible for our very hatred. **Any time you feel contempt for _anyone_ for _any reason whatsoever_, your mind is secretly gearing up to elevate or otherwise enrich yourself at the world's expense.**

Until this becomes _common knowledge_ (in the [technical sense](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/common-knowledge/) — where everyone knows that everyone knows that everyone knows...), humanity will continue to tie itself up in horrifying knots while pretending to be freeing itself from them. Unfortunately, our self-deception prevents us from making this _common knowledge_, no matter how clearly it is pointed out. This piece is such an attempt.

[//]: # (&#40;This is exemplified by "pseudo-kind" ideologies, in which people claim to be helping one person or group by demonizing another. I'm sure you can think of examples.&#41;)

What happens when your self-deception mechanism to "goes offline"? 

Your whole carefully-constructed reality — and the hierarchy of blame that scaffolds it — suddenly comes crashing down. The "great battles" that others are facing suddenly become obvious, as does your unfortunate role in having perpetuated them. It is impossible to communicate how painful the full epiphany is — to see what a hypocrite you've been; to be forcefully shown just how much of the world's darkness can be traced back to your own decisions to be unkind. But it's not all gloom and doom.

You then perceive your profound interconnectedness with the world. Malice, contempt, and self-righteousness are recognized as profoundly delusional. Seeing how confused people actually are, it is impossible to feel a trace of ill-will. You remember the sense in which you are not fundamentally better (or worse) than anyone, and why pretending that you are always makes the world darker. You feel boundless love for all of reality, recognizing your inseparability from every particle of it.

This perspective is not an altered state of consciousness, but something that is always there yet somehow curiously hidden. It feels like coming home to a place you never left. It is your deepest and most natural mode of knowing, which is how you will know that you can trust it.

There, you see that the root of the problem was the desire to be special; what the Buddhists call the _ego_. For those of us with a self-image as "good people," this manifests as the need to be _relatively_ good; i.e., good in comparison to others. This duality forces us to continually create "bad people" in all sorts of subtle ways that we can't consciously recognize. This process only comes to an end when we discover the _absolute_ good within.

This "absolute good" is something that we cannot take any credit for[^credit]. Instead, we can only feel profound gratitude for whatever grace allowed us to discover it, and heartbreak that it still remains so deeply hidden in others. The hardest part is watching the whole world being casually cruel to each other, unaware of which "team" they are secretly fighting for. It inspires a fierce determination to end the "possession" that has captured people's minds, instead of deepening it like we've unwittingly been doing. We clearly see the face of our true nemesis for the first time.

This doesn't mean that you will suddenly become nice or lovey-dovey toward evildoers. You may still need to be fierce, or perhaps even violent[^dalai-lama-gun]. Mockery, shaming, or even _apparent_ contempt might still be useful tools in your arsenal. But these will be in the service of _freeing_ people from the darkness, not pushing them further in. It is a kind of "tough love," and feels _nothing_ like the self-righteous antagonism that we normally feel when "fighting evil." You are still "connected to your heart." **That is what is most crucial.** Others can sense the profoundly benevolent intent (even if only subconsciously), and it makes _all the difference in the world_.

In every interaction you have two options: to either encourage the Light in others, or to fight their darkness with yours. **Encouraging their Light has nothing to do with being _nice_**. It is about being completely unwilling to abandon your own Light under _any circumstances_ — including the one that their darkness is presently testing you with. Their darkness is looking for a "hook" in your mind that it can use to justify itself — some sign that even you, the "good person," are weak to its seduction. If you refuse to abandon your integrity even then, the fierceness of your Light subjugates their darkness. They subconsciously remember that _the Light_ isn't just a myth.

This is authentic kindness (aka compassion). It is "radical" for two reasons. First, it contradicts our usual intuition that some people "deserve" it while others don't. It could never be the case that some people deserve to be shoved further into the abyss while others deserve to be freed from it. Second, it need not look anything like "kindness" in the conventional sense (though most often, it will). It certainly doesn't have to be soft or weak.

<p align="center" width="100%">
    <img width="300px" src="img/good-vs-bad.png"> 
</p>

I know it feels like some people don't _have_ an inner Light to encourage, but this is just an illusion that our darkness uses to get its foot in the door. By the time it has tricked us into dividing the world into fundamentally "good" and "bad" people — which feels like the most natural thing in the world — it has already infected the deepest aspect of our minds. Then, it can bide its time fostering conditions that will get us to commit unspeakable horror in the name of "good."[^genocide]

> _And no wonder, for even Satan masquerades as an angel of light._ —2 Corinthians 11:14

It is said that "the elites" are tricking us into hating each other to take attention off of themselves. Doesn't this make you hate them? Could it be that there is an even more subtle and wicked puppetmaster that is tricking us into hating _them_, so that we never discover _it_?

Indeed there is. No matter how much power the elites wield, it is _nothing_ compared to that of the dark entity pulling even their strings.

<p align="center" width="100%">
    <img width="300px" src="img/angel-devil-shoulders.png"> 
</p>

You know the classic image of the angel and devil sitting on our shoulders? It's _almost_ accurate, except for two things. First, the angel isn't external to you, but represents your intrinsically compassionate nature. Second, the devil _is_ extrinsic; it is a kind of parasite. But it doesn't just whisper obviously-bad ideas in your ear; it alters your very perception and pretends to _be_ your inner angel.

<p align="center" width="100%">
    <img width="300px" src="img/parasite.png"> 
</p>

It is this devil that tricks you into seeing other people as _fundamentally_ defective, instead of seeing that they are being manipulated by _their_ devils (which is something that your angel can always see). Our devils continually trigger each other — not because they are enemies, but _because they are allies_. Evil never actually fights evil; it only pretends to, to create more of itself.

<p align="center" width="100%">
    <img width="300px" src="img/shared-devil.png"> 
</p>

You know how people sometimes suspect that there's an "evil global conspiracy" lurking in the shadows, secretly running the show behind the scenes? They are not crazy. They are subconsciously sensing something genuine: there is indeed an aspect of all of our minds communicating with itself beneath our conscious thresholds, shielding itself from discovery in _insanely_ clever ways. Its greatest trick is to prevent us from suspecting, let alone detecting, our own role in keeping it alive.

Our individual devils are working together almost like a single "distributed organism" — the _Devil_, if you will. Each of us suspects its existence, but we all view it from different angles. No two people fully agree on who's ultimately pulling the strings of the evil plot. The truth is that _nobody_ is — and _everybody_ is.

<p align="center" width="100%">
    <img width="300px" src="img/evil-above-world.png"> 
</p>

This "dark entity" continually drives humanity toward various kinds of Armageddon: situations in which everyone is violently proving how _good_ they are. It is why the US is headed toward civil war without anyone suspecting their own complicity, and explains bitter [divorces](https://www.gottman.com/blog/this-one-thing-is-the-biggest-predictor-of-divorce/) in which each side feels like the exclusive victim / hero. Nearly the whole world is caught in its terrible sway, evil provoking "righteous" retribution at every turn, without anyone ever noticing the true source of it all.

This is not just a wacky theory, or just a metaphor. As best I can tell, everyone who introspects carefully enough eventually discovers this. Something within your very mind is conspiring with the darkness in others to produce a kind of Hell on Earth. Every time you feel contempt for _anyone_, your "devil" is reaching out to give theirs a kind of secret handshake; a sinister agreement to keep this world bound in darkness. I have used the word "subconscious" to describe this activity, but that's not quite accurate. **It is completely accessible to consciousness, if you know how to look.** It is something you are _doing._ [The Devil hides in the last place you would ever look](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gg8JYYyWSPg); the innermost chamber of your mind.

It is impossible to overstate the shock of discovering, for the first time, that you have _always_ been in on the "evil global conspiracy." It is terrifying, heartbreaking, and humbling all at once. Every single act of unkindness we've ever perpetrated has been in the service of the Beast, even when we told ourselves that we had "good intentions." This includes not only being cruel to other people, but _all_ acts in which we skirt our conscience — such as when we "shave off a little extra" for ourselves at the expense of others, or take pleasure in others' suffering, or countless other "innocent" misbehaviors. Every time we do this, we are strengthening each other's demons.

To be clear: there are surely groups of particularly "endarkened" people who consciously conspire to cause great harm, and **we must hold such people accountable** — but when we do so with contempt, we are secretly (and on a subconscious level, _knowingly_) reinforcing the very conditions that effectively compel their existence. They cannot be defeated without our seeing this.

<p align="center" width="100%">
    <img width="300px" src="img/evil-conspiracy.png"> 
</p>

Ironically, we have no leg to stand on if we're still feeling self-righteous, because that is the surest sign that we are still under the demon's malevolent sway. This is precisely the opposite of what that emotion tells us — that the more we feel it, the more _free_ of evil we must surely be. It is actually impossible to fight evil from this place, because self-deception can only ever create more of itself.

Our true enemy is not other people, but the dark "entity" that has captured _all_ of our minds. By keeping our attention fixated perpetually outward, it ensures that we never introspect deeply enough to discover our own complicity in keeping it alive. We _must_ learn to perceive this.

We each have a crucial role to play in bringing down the "global conspiracy," and it begins by rediscovering our Light.

MLK once said:

> *Darkness cannot drive out darkness; only light can do that. Hate cannot drive out hate; only love can do that.*

These words are far wiser than we know. Ultimately, evil is not actually a _presence_ (like it seems), but an _absence_. The absence of what? Of the perception of the interconnectedness of all Life; of our fundamental equality with others. That this absence can behave so much like a presence — and an _intelligent_ one at that — is astonishing.

In a profound and surprising sense, [you _are_ the world](unity.md). Ultimately, all self-deception boils down to ignorance of this fact. This ignorance is not fully dispelled until _enlightenment_, but we can all sense it at all times. It is why certain literature speaks to us so loudly, and why we sometimes thank strangers for acts of charity that don't seem to benefit us directly. Part of us knows that what happens to the world ultimately happens to us. It is senseless to scorn people for not having realized this.

It is not possible to reduce the darkness in the world by withholding our own Light; by leveraging our contempt[^contempt], malice, hatred, etc. That is an insidious trap that we _must_ see through if humanity is to survive. Your Light is capable of accomplishing everything you think you need your darkness for, and much, much more — but there is a price that must be paid: you must give up the illusion of being special; of being fundamentally different from the "bad people." You must relinquish the sinister pleasure of watching harm come to your enemies. In brief, you must give up self-deception.

In exchange, you will discover the path toward the world you actually want in your deepest heart of hearts. It is well worth the price, and infinitely more.

## Addendum

(TODO)

- Compassion doesn't mean you know what the most beneficial behavior _is_; it merely ensures that you are not falling into the many seductive traps of your darkness. Determining the most effective behavior requires _wisdom_, which is a vast topic, and beyond the scope of this work. Compassion may be no easier to acquire than wisdom, but it is much simpler: there is a single place within your mind that you can turn to and _know_ whether you are allying with the darkness or the Light.


- "Outrage" can mean (healthy) anger directed at correcting an injustice, but it quickly gets corrupted into self-righteous indignation. Similarly, "judgement" can refer to wise discernment, but it quickly devolves into disdain. Just like "compassion" doesn't really mean "being nice," these words get redefined by our evil so that we make a mess of what is actually quite simple.

Would you notice when _you_ crossed the line? You probably believe that you would, but it's not so simple. The way your devil works is by finding steps that are too small for you to waste time questioning them. And after you've taken a step, your mind always justifies it, to maintain your sanity. After taking 1000 such baby steps, somewhere you will have "crossed the line" — but the truth is that the very first step already crossed the only line that matters: the one where you went from following what you know to be right in your heart of hearts; your conscience, to following what your mind tells you is right; "justifications"; your devil. Don't ever take that first step away from your Heart. It is already evil.)


## Footnotes

[^contempt]: Specifically, we mean (genuine) contempt for *people*. Contempt for ideas or behaviors can actually be healthy, as perhaps can (apparent) contempt that is rooted in genuine compassion.

[^credit]: In fact, taking credit for it is one way to be sure that we haven't found "it."

[^dalai-lama-gun]: The Dalai Lama was once asked what you should do if a gunman is trying to shoot you and you have a gun. [He said "shoot back."](https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/dalai-gun/)

[^genocide]: This is how genocides happen. The Nazis referred to Jews as 'vermin,' and during the genocide in Rwanda, Tutsis were referred to as 'cockroaches.' This is a common pattern throughout history. Perhaps paradoxically, the only way to be sure that you'd never do such a thing is that you don't feel contempt for the people who have.



[//]: # (The "bad people" know perfectly well that what they're doing is wrong, but that "wrongness" is very cleverly shielded from conscious self-reflection. Any "good" person should want to be _free_ them of this deception, not to compound it — and being free of self-deception themselves, they would perceive that contempt is the wrong way to go about this.)

[//]: # (Think back to a time when you disobeyed your conscience, pretending either that you couldn't hear it or that you could safely ignore it. We've all done this. When this happens, a schism is created in your mind: part of you knows _perfectly well_ that you're doing wrong, but that knowledge is cleverly shielded from conscious self-reflection. It is then easy to convince others that you _don't_ know, because you have convinced _yourself_. **All evil relies on this mechanism of self-deception**. We notice it easily in others, but in ourselves only when it's convenient to our self-image.)

[//]: # (This is what is happening in the "bad people.")

[//]: # (Evil never _feels_ evil — or rather, even when it _does_ feel evil, that evil feels _right._ That's the most terrifying thing, and the hardest to describe. The worse a behavior is, the _harder_ your self-deception will work to cover up the "wrongness." The greatest evils feel exactly like how you feel when mocking your enemies, but a thousand times more righteous. **If you cannot detect the "wrongness" in your mockery now, you will not be able to detect it when committing atrocities.** You may believe that your morals will alert you when you're crossing the line, but this is the greatest lie: you aren't currently listening to the part of you that actually knows right from wrong; you are listening to your _justifications_ — and every time you do, they grow more seductive.)

[//]: # (It's not until _after_ you wake up from this self-induced trance that you discover just how badly you were fooling yourself. People were even trying to _warn_ you — but in that grotesque state, you couldn't see what they were pointing at. In fact, the harder they tried, the more you perceived _them_ as evil, crazy, or stupid — which only deepened your self-deceptive trance. But most horrifically of all, you will discover that **some part of you always knew that you were doing wrong, even as you pretended not to**. By this point it is too late to make amends.)

[//]: # (Something within you _wants_ to push people further into the dark, but doesn't want to be caught doing so. This is malevolent. People can subconsciously sense this intention, and this by itself is enough to provoke the darkness in their minds. Mission accomplished; more darkness was created without you having to do anything provably evil. All it took was your dark motivation — something that you can trivially deny, even to yourself. It is this dark pattern that "good people" employ to maintain their self-image. _Genuinely_ good people don't behave that way. They _never_ look down on others, because this is the surest sign of self-deception.)

[//]: # (To be fair, there does seem to be a tiny percentage of people who have consciously welcomed the demon in, for whom the description "evil" really does capture something important. Such people pose a unique challenge. Being "kind" to them in the conventional sense can indeed be dangerous. And yet the very _deepest_ aspect of their mind does not want it. Again, it is only once you see exactly what "it" is that you understand why _nobody_ ultimately could. Think of it like a form of Stockholm syndrome. If you want to defeat evil, you must want them to be free of it, too.)

[//]: # (When we meet &#40;or even hear about&#41; such people, we often experience the overwhelming urge to hate them, but this is the ultimate trap. It is their darkness inviting ours to treat them in a way that will drive them further into its clutches — and we very often take the bait. How could we not? It is like a gift-wrapped present: the opportunity to manifest our darkest tendencies in a way that we can convince ourselves and others is unmistakably _good._ )
