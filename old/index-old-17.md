If you wish to defeat the evil in the world, you must first defeat the evil in your own mind. But why?

All evil works in essentially the same way. Part of the person's mind knows perfectly well that they are doing _wrong_, but that knowledge is very carefully shielded from conscious self-reflection, so that it doesn't _feel_ wrong. All they hear are their own clever justifications. Every one of us knows this state intimately well. We have all skirted our conscience before, pretending either that we couldn't hear it or that we didn't have to listen. Our examples may differ in degree, but _not_ in kind.

We don't mock and shame our enemies because of the good it will do, but because they are easy targets for our self-deception. We use them as excuses to self-aggrandize and to justify our own self-serving agendas. But we do not consciously realize that we are doing this. It is hidden from our minds in precisely the same way that _their_ misbehavior is hidden from them. Yet, you can learn to see that your mind is spreading darkness if you know how to look. Our mistake is that we rarely look.

If you did, here's what you would find. Your enemy can subconsciously sense that you are engaged in essentially the _same_ deception that you are viciously judging _them_ for, which makes _you_ appear evil to _them_. They therefore feel compelled to return the favor, which appears evil to you. After all, your intentions were pure. Any _decent_ person would have repented or at least introspected in the face of such goodness. But they instead doubled down, proving that they are indeed _fundamentally morally defective_, thus licensing you to escalate. This is _profound_ self-deception.

What we cannot see is that something in our minds _needs_ to keep animosity alive in this world, because if all the darkness out there were to suddenly evaporate, our _own_ would become impossible to hide. So the deception in all of our minds is cooperating, conspiring to keep all of humanity mired in darkness, without anyone discovering its true origin within their very own minds. It is impossible to overstate the fiendish cleverness of this ruse. The _only_ reason you ever perceive anyone as fundamentally defective, or yourself as intrinsically superior, is to perpetuate animosity.

In fact, our darkness is not merely cooperating. Our cumulative darkness actually behaves more like a singular distributed malevolent entity; manipulating all of humanity from beneath our conscious thresholds. It is why we suspect the existence of an evil global conspiracy. It is the _primordial_ evil conspiracy; the one to which all the rest owe their existence, and to which they all ultimately filter up. The Christians know it as the Devil, and the Buddhists call it the ego. You can treat it as a metaphor, but it is also as real as anything you can touch. Unkindness _always_ feeds the Beast.

Make no mistake: there are certainly people who knowingly embrace the darkness, and who are conspiring to bring great harm — and they must be stopped. Kindness doesn't mean being nice or gentle; it can be fierce or even violent if necessary. It need not look like conventional kindness at all. There is no particular form that it must take. It simply means recognizing when we are being overtaken by the darkness, and refusing to give it even an inch.

> _And no wonder, for even Satan masquerades as an angel of light. So it is not strange that his ministers also masquerade as ministers of righteousness._ —2 Corinthians 11:14-16

A mind that is free of self-deception simply cannot feel genuine malice, contempt, or self-righteousness toward any person for any reason, because it always perceives the hidden aspect of their mind that wishes only to be _free_ of the darkness. Even if punishment is required, it will be done with the intention to free their mind, not the malevolent urge to punish them. This difference in intention makes _all_ the difference in the world, even if your mind tells you that it couldn't _possibly_. For it is only ever your darkness that tries to convince you of that; your Light has access to a much subtler perception of causality. It sees how what is in your Heart always leaks out into the world, one way or another, like it or not.

Of course, it can be very difficult to discern intention from the outside — at least, consciously. People can still _subconsciously_ tell, which is why your urge to punish provokes their darkness, as described before. But because you have plausible deniability regarding your true intentions, you never have to admit this to anybody — including yourself. This is the _only_ reason that you ever perceive other people as defective: it is your mind giving you plausible deniability.

It is only once you see precisely how you hide this knowledge from your own mind that you begin to appreciate what makes it so hard for the "bad people" to recognize what _they_ are really doing. It then becomes impossible to judge them — at least, _contemptuously_ judge them. Of course _wise discernment_ is still available. They can perceive this change in attitude. It is as though your inner Light is signaling to theirs.

This Light is what you _are_ in your innermost being. It is the Christ within; your Buddha-nature. It always perceives the inner Light within others, even when they cannot see it themselves. It perceives how their minds have been enslaved by the darkness, and how to free them of it. It could not possibly want to shove them deeper into the abyss. It would be madness.

While your inner Light is a real thing — indeed, the realest _possible_ thing — the darkness is ultimately an illusion and can thus always be dispelled. It is nothing but the _absence_ of the Light. Humans are not _fundamentally_ greedy or selfish, even if our darkness is so deeply entrenched that it appears convincingly otherwise. It can be undone, and we each have a role to play in undoing it.

> _I wish I could show you, when you are lonely or in darkness, the astonishing Light of your own Being._ —Hafiz of Shiraz

At the very deepest level, nobody could ever actually _want_ to turn away from their Light, because it is the very fulfillment they unknowingly seek. But for reasons unknown, the Light sometimes undergoes a spontaneous apparent separation from itself. When this occurs, the mind becomes confused, fearing that it somehow caused this separation. This kernel of guilt makes it want to hide from the Light, but there is nowhere to run. This triggers a runaway process in which it must increasingly convince itself that it *is* the Light, to avoid confronting that primordial yet illusory guilt. Having thus convinced itself of its own righteousness, it roams the world, hunting down those who refuse to "_see_ the light."

In other words, our decision to see other people as defective is nothing but fear of our own enlightenment, and by giving it credence, we further distance ourselves and them from the peace we most deeply long for. It is a tragic mistake of the highest order. In fact, the reality you perceive as external to yourself is nothing but a projection of your own confusion. I know this is hard to swallow, but you may take a hint from neuroscience, which confirms that our perceived reality is a kind of hallucination. It turns out you can learn to introspect and get to the heart of this illusion. There, you discover the astonishing truth: that you _are_ everyone and everything, just pretending that you're not. Harming the world always harms yourself, and by forsaking others, you are only forsaking yourself. You cannot ultimately "get away" with anything, so why bother trying? You might as well just save yourself lifetimes of needless suffering and head toward the Light _now_.

Even if this seems far-fetched to you now, something deep within you knows that it is only ever your Love that nudges us all toward the more beautiful world our hearts know is possible. Everything else either just shuffles the bits around or drives us further away. It may then appear convincingly as though we are making progress, but it is an illusion. So remember your inner Light, and resolve never to stray from it, under any circumstances. For when your perceived reality is withdrawn back into the Light from whence it arose — in other words, what we commonly know as "death" — you will remember that all else was merely distraction, and that you somehow always knew this, all along, even when you pretended not to.

May all beings be free from suffering and its causes. Amen.
