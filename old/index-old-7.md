All misbehavior — from cutting in line to genuine atrocities — is ultimately enabled by a kind of parasite in the mind. Think of it as that devil on our shoulders. But this devil doesn't just whisper obviously-evil ideas in our ears; no, it alters our very perception, so that it appears okay — or even _righteous_ — to step on certain people. It shields us from confronting the full implications of our words and behaviors.

The "bad people" know perfectly well when what they are doing is wrong, but that knowledge is very cleverly hidden from conscious self-reflection. If you try to viciously force them to confront it, it just drives the parasite deeper into their minds. But something in you already knows this.

When _you_ are in the grip of self-deception — and we've all been there — you do not tolerate contemptuous judgement from others. Why? Because it signals to you that _they_ are in a state of self-deception and are in no position to be judging you. You see them as _bad people_ who need to be put in _their_ place, and feel _even more_ licensed to do whatever you need to do — which in turn convinces them that they were right about you all along. It is the **contempt** that drives this outcome, not the mere **judgement** (in the sense of _wise discernment_).

The same is true when the positions are reversed. Self-righteous outrage feels damn good — i.e., both enjoyable and virtuous — and yet something in you knows that it will just make them dig in their heels. The hard thing to admit is that part of you _wants_ this, because it helps you prove just how _bad_ they are; how totally unlike you. But there's one small problem.

Subconsciously, you can perceive that they are actually in the grip of a terrible demon that you yourself share — indeed, that is controlling your mind _right now_ — and this similarity horrifies you. So you shove them deeper into the abyss to hide this fact from yourself — because the deeper they go, the easier it is to perceive them as _fundamentally defective_, as opposed to fellow humans who badly need help. (Indeed, beyond a certain point, even _they_ cannot consciously perceive this of themselves. At that point, who can really blame us for being cruel?)

This actually creates _new_ evil, but it doesn't feel like that. It feels like you are zeroing in on existing evil; exposing or distilling the hidden evil that is already there. It is as though you are finally catching a hold of the source of darkness in the world, and are finally _punishing_ it. It feels impossibly righteous to be nasty to "bad people."

> _And no wonder, for even Satan masquerades as an angel of light. So it is not strange that his ministers also masquerade as ministers of righteousness._ —2 Corinthians 11:14-16

But this is all a smokescreen created by your devil. It knows perfectly well that this behavior darkens the world. In fact, that is its whole game. But it must never let you know this, and so it hides this behind _astonishingly_ seductive justifications that you don't even realize are seductions. All you consciously feel is "I'm fighting evil" — and you have all the evidence to prove it.

What "actually" happened was that under the covers, _their_ devil reached out to yours to offer it a secret handshake — and you signaled agreement simply by feeling contempt. **Contempt is the secret tool by which our devils coordinate, beneath our conscious thresholds.** It is the opposite of kindness; that part of you that wants what's best for everyone. No matter how carefully you disguise it — even from yourself — it always leaks out into the world.

If you look carefully, you will discover that our devils together behave more like a single malevolent distributed entity — the _Devil_, if you will. It is that archetypal "evil conspiracy" that we subconsciously fear exists — the one to which all the rest ultimately owe their existence, and to which they all ultimately report — _and every one of us is secretly in on it_. It remains hidden by keeping our attention fixated perpetually outward, blinding us to our own participation.

Every time we feel malice, contempt, or self-righteousness; any time we are unkind to anyone for any reason, we are secretly feeding the Beast. Every act of unkindness ripples through its terrible body, lowering the threshold for more acts of evil to erupt in faraway locations — for which we will feel absolutely no complicity. But part of us always knows.

To be clear, we're certainly not all equally complicit. There are surely groups of particularly "endarkened" people who consciously conspire to cause great harm, and **we must hold such people accountable**. But when we do so with contempt, we are reinforcing the very conditions that effectively _compel_ their existence — and a deep part of us knows this.

So far I have been calling this all "subconscious," but that's not entirely accurate. The greatest shock is discovering that it was somehow _always_ accessible to consciousness, if we'd just bothered to look. This isn't a judgement of us. We _want_ to look, but something keeps stopping us. Our duty is to discover whatever that is, and heal it.

Nobody ultimately _wants_ to be under the sway of their devil — the key word being "ultimately." There are certainly people who willingly harbor it; those whom we classically think of as "evil." It would be foolish to be "kind" to them in the _conventional_ sense. Yet it is far _more_ foolish to feel malice, because that is **exactly** what their demon wants — and it is also where it is hardest to detect our own self-deception, and the easiest to justify it to others. It is the ultimate trap.

The more you unearth your own demon, the more clearly you see that such people are suffering from a kind of Stockholm syndrome — and the more acutely you feel the malevolence of driving them toward their captor. It smothers what little light is left. (If you believe that they _have_ no light, consider that this may be exactly the "trap" I just described.) It is literally the _worst_ time to be unkind. Unconventional means may be necessary to deal with them, but unkindness never is. This could only be true if "kindness" does not mean what we usually think.

**True kindness is not about being _nice._** It can be fierce or even [violent](https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/dalai-gun/) if necessary. It only requires being lucidly aware of your own capacity for self-deception, and refusing to fall into it. It is about staying connected to your Heart; that part of you that remembers the Truth — the very thing that your parasite is lulling you into forgetting. **Your fight is with the parasite. Hating the host just strengthens it.**

The more you remember this, the more your very way of being inspires others to remember. Then, bit by bit you notice that even "evil" has no fundamental essence; that it is not a thing that can be "fought." It is not a _presence_, but an _absence._ An absence of what? Of the perception of our deep interconnectedness and fundamental equality. Hating people for not yet perceiving this makes no sense. Only your Light can bring about the better world you most deeply desire — and only you know what form your Light must take to make that happen.

Our true nemesis is never other people, despite obvious appearance to the contrary. It is the delusion that has ensnared all of our minds. The more we come to recognize just how badly it has fooled us, the more we appreciate what the "bad people" are really up against, and the more we can be of genuine service in dispelling it. We each have a role to play, and it always begins with us.
