> _For so long as the root of wickedness is hidden, it is strong. But when it is recognized, it is dissolved. When it is revealed, it perishes. ... It is powerful because we have not recognized it._ — The Gospel of Philip

We think that hating "bad people" is a sign of the good within us, but it's actually a sign of something _much darker_.

People are only able to cause (willful) harm due to a kind of self-deception: part of them knows perfectly well that they are doing wrong, but that knowledge is very carefully shielded from conscious self-reflection. All they hear are their own clever justifications. It is this mechanism that has enabled _all the evil there ever was_ — and it has enabled our own misbehavior too, if we're honest. We have all skirted our conscience before, pretending either that we couldn't hear it or that we didn't have to listen.

We don't mock and shame our political enemies because of the good it will do, but because we know that it will make them feel _more_ justified in their misbehavior. But we pretend not to know this, so that when it inevitably happens, we can blame it entirely on them. We now have more proof that they are evil, and have no choice but to escalate. You have no idea how much self-deception you are capable of, and in all likelihood, are already engaged in. In a certain sense, it isn't your fault. There is a kind of parasite in your mind that is radically altering your perception to prevent you from seeing all of this.

At the deepest level, you know that you are not fundamentally better than anyone. You know that all of life is intimately connected; that what we do to anyone ultimately happens to everyone. In fact, in a certain profound and astonishing sense, you _are_ everyone and everything. But something in your mind dissuades you from seeing this. Instead of recognizing other people as being under the sway of the same parasite that you are infected with, you perceive them as _fundamentally defective_. Your parasite knows that by acting this way, you will only empower other people's parasites. Why? Because they can sense that you're not acting from a place of genuine good; that you're being self-deceptive. This is the very essence of evil, which they feel licensed to fight in any way they deem necessary. It lends credence to their self-deception.

This is on purpose. Our parasites are coordinating. In fact, if you look carefully, you'll see that they behave more like outgrowths of a single distributed malevolent entity. This is the reason some people believe in an evil global conspiracy. In a certain sense, there really _is_ one, and every one of us is secretly in on it. Every time you are unkind to anyone for any reason; every time you engage in any kind of self-deception, you are subconsciously telegraphing to everyone, friend or foe, that _their_ self-deception is justified; even _necessary._ And  this is all kept in the dark from our conscious minds. This darkness ripples out into the world, accumulating in pockets that we then judge and blame from afar, licensing more darkness. It is literally the perfect trap, and we keep falling for it.

Make no mistake: there really _are_ people who knowingly embrace the darkness, and who can surely be called "evil." And they really do conspire in ways that harm all of us. But if you feel contempt for them, then you are being played by exactly the same parasite that has commandeered their minds, and you are secretly _empowering_ it, even as it convinces you that you are valiantly fighting it. The only way to actually fight the beast is kindness.

Kindness does not mean being nice. Sometimes it must be fierce, or even violent. But it does not contain even a trace of malice, contempt, or self-righteousness; recognizing these as the self-deception that they are. It sees the sense in which nobody actually wants to be infected by the parasite; even those who are convinced that they do. Its deep integrity serves as a reminder to others of the part of themselves that longs to be free of the parasite. It is not naive, expecting that people will change overnight or maybe ever. But neither does it forsake them.

The more deeply infected the other person is, the harder it is not to fall into the trap yourself, and the easier it is to convince yourself that you haven't when you actually have. This is also the greatest opportunity to fight back. For if you can resist becoming even slightly evil in the face of great evil, then you are demonstrating to all of reality that evil doesn't have the power that it appears to; that there is something stronger than it; that can never be corrupted by it.

Most of us have _no idea_ how much self-deception we engage in, because our minds hide it so well. For example, we don't hate "bad people" to make the world better. We perceive people as _fundamentally defective_ to trigger their primal defense mechanisms, which reinforces their self-deception, which gives us even _more_ evil to fight. Seeing evil as intrinsic to other people's minds is therefore itself a form of evil. We do it to help us justify some self-serving behavior that we otherwise could not — and that we may not even be aware of.

But the really surprising part is that our self-deception and theirs are not actually fighting each other. It is as though there is a parasite in each of our minds that is responsible for creating the mental schism that allows us to hide our true motivations from ourselves. We perceive theirs as intrinsic and they perceive ours that way because both of ours are trying to create more darkness in the world, which enables them both to grow and spread. It is a kind of mind-virus that has overtaken humanity, and you have _no idea_ how clever it is.

If you've ever suspected that there is an evil global conspiracy running the show from behind the scenes, it is this that you are sensing. Our viruses are coordinating, behaving together like a single distributed malevolent entity. If your parasite is that devil on your shoulder, then our aggregate darkness is the capital-d _Devil_. It is the primordial evil conspiracy; the one to which all the rest ultimately owe their existence, and to which they all filter up. Each one of us can only perceive the aspect of it that is external to us, where it tricks us into strengthening it even as we're convinced that we're fighting it. It keeps our attention fixated on the evil "out there" precisely so that we never bother to look too closely "in here"; the one place where we actually have power over it.

Make no mistake: there _are_ people out there who have willingly invited the darkness in and are embracing it. Describing them as "evil" is conventionally appropriate. But the only way to perceive that evil as _intrinsic_ to their minds, or to feel contempt for them and to forsake them is for your own virus to be in control of your mind without you realizing it. From this place, you are only capable of adding more darkness to the world, although you will not know that you are doing so. This is what keeps humanity trapped in darkness.

Kindness is any behavior that is free of darkness, which means that it is free of egoic taint.

We don't hate "bad people" for how different they are from us, but for how similar. Hating them is a way to take our attention off of what is going on inside. It also licenses us to treat them in ways that we secretly know will _compound_ their self-deception; make them feel _more_ justified in their misbehavior — which we can then take as further evidence that they are _fundamentally defective,_ and nothing like us. The way this works is insanely clever.

Simply by feeling contempt, we telegraph to others that we are under the sway of self-deception. The deepest part of us knows that we're not _fundamentally_ better than anyone, and that pretending we are is just an excuse to shove them further into the dark while calling it "righteous." Our enemies subconsciously recognize that we are doing this, and so they perceive us as _evil_ for precisely the same reason that we see them that way. And since we "don't know" that we're doing this, that becomes airtight evidence that _they_ are evil.

In other words, feeling contempt for "evil people" is a secret way to create _more_ evil. It is the perfect trap, and it is caused by a kind of mental parasite; a mind-virus. We never notice that we ourselves are infected; we only see it in others — which our parasite uses as an excuse to violently attack them, knowing perfectly well what the outcome will be. It knows this because our parasite and theirs are fundamentally identical. 

In fact, they are more than just identical: they are more like limbs of a single _malevolent distributed entity,_ manipulating all of humanity from behind the scenes. The surest sign that you are infected is the certainty that you are not — and the feelings of malice, contempt, and self-righteousness that arise in response to the "bad people." A mind free of the parasite simply cannot feel those things; it only sees fellow humans under the terrible sway of humanity's oldest foe, and who are always capable of being "rescued" from it.

Deep down, we know that this is the true cause of people's misbehavior — and that hating them for it only _reinforces_ that tendency. But we pretend that this behavior is righteous; that we are "fighting evil." It is precisely this pretending that clues them in to the fact that we ourselves are under the sway of self-deception, making us appear "evil" to them, thus helping them feel justified in their misbehavior. This recalcitrance in turn "proves" to us that we are right about them, because we "don't know" that we intentionally provoked it.

The sole purpose of contempt — for _people_, as opposed to merely their beliefs or behaviors — is to bait them into behavior that justifies our contempt in a way that gives us plausible deniability. Your mind then uses them as an excuse to justify self-serving behaviors that you otherwise would not let yourself get away with. It may not be obvious what exactly you're getting from it, but if you look carefully enough, you will always find it. This is how the "bad people" convince themselves that they're doing nothing wrong — and it is also how we all but guarantee their continued existence.

Something in us _needs_ "bad people" to exist, to provide cover for something in ourselves that we haven't yet come to terms with. Such cover is the _only_ purpose of contempt, regardless of whom it is aimed at — the regular Joes across the political aisle, or the "evil elites" who are tricking us into hating each other for their own nefarious ends. The elites themselves are prey to exactly the same mind-virus that has infected us, and that continually tricks us into _reinforcing_ it in each other instead of fighting it.

The _only_ way to fight it is to recognize yourself in others; to see that at the very deepest level, they have no more desire to be infected than you do. It is only the virus that makes them _appear_ to want it (or to believe they want it), and to make you hate them for it. It is always the same trap.

When you encounter someone in this state, you have two options. The first is to to recognize them as being caught in this dark trap, which gives rise to the natural instinct to free them from it. The other is to perceive it as being _intrinsic_ to them; to see them as _fundamentally defective._ This gives rise to the dark urge to shove them deeper into the abyss, where they "belong."

The latter is always self-deception. Part of you knows that you're not _intrinsically_ better than anyone — and that when you act like you are, you only inspire them to dig in their heels. This makes "bad people" _worse_ — but you can easily convince yourself (and your allies) that this is their fault. They are _bad,_ after all.

You can either recognize them as being caught in this dark trap, or choose to perceive them as _fundamentally morally defective._ The former gives rise to the natural instinct to free them from it — and thereby free the _world_ of it. The latter is secretly a desire to shove them deeper in. It is a profound form of self-deception.

As such, it will not _feel_ like self-deception. It will feel impossibly righteous, like you are "fighting evil." But your contempt secretly has only one purpose: to _increase_ the darkness in the world. Why? Part of our mind is trying to get away with something, and it knows that the darker the world becomes, the easier a time we will have in hiding it. Hating "bad people" is our mind's way of spreading darkness in a way that appears noble on the surface. It is evil in disguise. 
You can recognize it in yourself as malice, contempt, or self-righteousness.



The way it works is _insanely_ clever. Your darkness recognizes theirs as a perfect opportunity to manifest itself in you. It knew that you would welcome it. Once you did so — which only requires feeling _contempt_ — their darkness in turn recognized itself in you. It is a kind of secret handshake. You feel flawlessly convinced that you are "fighting evil," but they see you as a hypocrite, thereby feeling even less compunction in harming you. Part of your mind knows exactly what you're doing, and that they are _right_. So you must now push this knowledge out of mind even harder. 

This is precisely what the darkness wants: for both of you to embrace it and thereby be fully confident that you are _not._

Compassion is the desire to free them from it — and therefore, to free the _world_ from it, at least a little.

This mind-state is _infectious_: simply by engaging in it, we induce it in others. We have an incentive to normalize that state, because the more others overlook their consciences, the more licensed we feel to disregard our own. Of course, we don't know that we're doing this — at least, consciously. Our mind generates a flawlessly compelling story in which we are the noble heroes. But our subconscious always knows the truth.

Hating other people is _always_ a sign of self-deception. So are malice, self-righteousness, and contempt (for _people_). Your mind is trying to hide something from you, though you may not know what yet. When you attack your enemies from this state, they tend to just dig in their heels and vow to fight harder, don't they? This just proves how _right_ you were about them, thus compelling you to escalate. But it is a sinister lie.

Your darkness can indeed suppress other people's misbehavior — at least, their _public_ misbehavior, and for a time. You can thus convince yourself that it "worked." But even if you manage to violently eradicate your enemies, doing so from this profoundly dark place will powerfully awaken the shadows of every person whose mind it touches, directly or indirectly, "friend" or "foe." This is not an accident: it is secretly the whole point. Something in you _wants_ this to happen.

The ancients knew it as the _Devil_: a malevolent force relentlessly driving humanity toward catastrophe. However literally you want to take this, there is something to be seen here — something that we are overlooking to our own profound peril.

From a certain perspective, the darkness appears sentient; almost _intelligent._ It behaves like a distributed malevolent entity, continually manipulating human minds for its own sinister ends. When you look in a person's eyes and see "evil," _this_ is what you are seeing. It has taken up residence in the minds of all "bad people" — and it lives within us, too.

It is that classic devil on your shoulder — but unlike in the cartoons, it doesn't just whisper obviously-evil ideas into your year. No, this devil alters your very perception such that certain evils appear okay; even _righteous._ Its greatest trick is to make other people appear _intrinsically_ evil, so that you will conflate _it_ with _them_ — inducing contempt, thereby powerfully strengthening it. It is always one step ahead, making you tilt at windmills.

It derives all of its power from our willingness to _look away_. There is a part of us that always knows the "right thing" to do, but a small voice in us tells us that we don't have to listen.

[//]: # (It cannot survive on its own: it requires our participation to stay alive and breed.)

It is a form of possession, which some people have indeed welcomed in. But feeling either hatred or pity for them only strengthens it.

When we encounter other people in this state, we perceive it as _evil_, and it evokes a powerful reaction. We feel the urge to violently extinguish it, which manifests as a desire to viciously attack _them._

This is precisely what their "evil" wants: for you to conflate _it_ with _them,_ thereby tricking you into behaving in a way that will amplify the darkness in the world. But you won't realize that you're doing this: you will instead feel flawlessly confident that you are valiantly _fighting evil_. You have been drawn into the self-deceptive state yourself. Any action you take from this place will darken the world, and part of you will know it — but you will be unable to admit it to yourself.

Your darkness can indeed suppress other people's misbehavior — at least, their _public_ misbehavior, and for a time. You will thus convince yourself that it "worked." But even if you manage to violently eradicate your enemies, doing so from this profoundly dark place will powerfully awaken the shadows of every person whose mind it touches, directly or indirectly, "friend" or "foe." This is not an accident: it is secretly the whole point.



It is an _insanely_ clever trap. Every one of us has the power to eliminate a bit of evil from the world — and instead of doing that, we are tricked into spreading it.

The way to know whether you are spreading good or evil isn't by inspecting the content of your thoughts or your beliefs. It doesn't matter how noble or well-intentioned they are: it is the hidden activity going on beneath the surface that makes all the difference. If you are "protecting victims" from a place of contempt for the perpetrators, you are subtly manipulating the surrounding minds to 


[//]: # (You have _no idea_ how good we are at lying to ourselves and then pushing this knowledge out of consciousness. But part of us _always knows_. The "bad people" are simply those who have been most successful at hiding it from themselves.)

[//]: # ()
[//]: # (We can see that they're doing this, but they somehow cannot. This gives rise to the urge to _force_ them to see it.)

We rarely recognize it at work in others. Instead of seeing a fellow human under the sway of a powerful illusion — one that we ourselves are all-too-susceptible to — we perceive them as _fundamentally morally defective;_ totally unlike us. Such a person cannot be helped; they can only be subdued or punished — and it is our righteous duty to do so.

If you look carefully enough, you'll find that contempt for "bad people" is secretly designed to make them _worse_; to _reinforce_ their capacity for self-deception. Whether or not you have a valid point about their behavior, your contempt will only trigger their defense mechanisms. This is on purpose: if you can get them to dig in their heels, you can "prove" that they really _are_ fundamentally bad, which will justify your contempt — and license escalation. A few more rounds of this, and you'll get what you're really after: an unmistakably evil foe who you will be forced to violently defeat. This is the most delicious feeling in the world.

But you will never let yourself know that you're doing this. Your mind will carefully construct a flawlessly convincing story about how you were simply "fighting evil." You have _no idea_ how insanely clever your subconscious is at intentionally pressing people's buttons while pretending not to be. If you were to suddenly become aware of all the times in life that you've done this, it would cause a meltdown of your ego.

Exactly the same mechanism lives within our very own minds, though we rarely recognize it. It is what allows us to mock our political opponents with glee. We tell ourselves that they deserve it, and that it is making the world a better place — and we _believe_ this with all our hearts. Well, not really _all_ our hearts. The very deepest part of us always knows better, but we carefully shield this knowledge from conscious self-reflection. Sound familiar?

It's easy to get lost in speculation about whether such behavior is actually a net harm or good, especially because we don't get to see all of its downstream effects. But even if we do see the second-, third-, etc. order effects — like a humiliated father venting his frustration on his children, who then grow up to become "bad people" themselves — we never make the connection back to our own behavior. And even if by some miracle we do, we easily avoid recognizing our complicity. Sure, we may have provoked him, but he should have handled it with grace. Why didn't he just become a _better person_, like we so clearly intended?

Instead of getting lost in such speculation, there's something else you can do. If you inspect your mind carefully enough during such speculation, you'll discover that such contemptuous behavior only exists to hide something that your subconscious mind is secretly doing.

You see, part of us actually _wants_ "bad people" to become worse. Why? Because this enables us to feel like _better people_ by comparison; to reinforce our worldview of who's good and who's bad. But this is extremely hard to admit to ourselves. So our mind finds _exceedingly_ clever ways to push the "bad people" further into the dark in ways that we can label "righteous." When executed well — which is most of the time — you will never even suspect that you're doing this. The very idea will sound offensively absurd. And if anyone tries to point it out, powerful defense mechanisms will kick in, making it even harder to see — especially if they do it with even a trace of contempt.

The truth is that any time you are unkind; any time you feel contempt, malice, or self-righteousness toward _anyone_ for _any reason_; it is your ego operating, attempting to elevate or otherwise enrich yourself at the world's expense. It is _precisely_ the same mechanism that allows the "bad people" to do what they do — and when you give in to yours, you are reinforcing their tendency to do the same. **And this isn't an unfortunate side effect of your otherwise-noble intentions; it is in fact the _whole point_.**

To put it more simply: we don't hate bad people to make the world a better place; we hate them to make ourselves feel (and look) good _by making it worse_. In fact, we don't even have to feel hatred. Simply seeing a person as irredeemable is already an unmistakable sign that this terrible process is underway in your subconscious.

I realize this is a hard thing to accept, and that you're unlikely to believe me unless you've seen it clearly yourself. But I swear it is the truth — and it is something that you can discover firsthand yourself.

Seeing the full extent of it is what the Buddhists call _enlightenment._ You discover a shocking sense in which _you are everyone and everything._ The very deepest aspect of your mind is pure compassion, as is that of everyone else. But they've forgotten this, just as you yourself had for innumerable lifetimes. The very last thing you could ever want to do is continue to push them _further_ from realizing it — which is the inevitable result of perceiving them as fundamentally separate from yourself; of forsaking them.

This is not some bleeding heart idea. Kindness does not mean being nice, or sweet, or tolerant, or understanding. It simply means seeing the nature of reality clearly, so that your behavior inspires others to remember the astonishing truth instead of pushing them away from it. Such behavior may be fierce or even violent; it may look nothing like conventional "kindness" on the surface. But the very deepest part of you always knows the difference.

All of the darkness in the world is intimately connected — and part of it lives within your very own mind. By keeping your portion alive, you ensure that it continues to flourish "out there." That is why everything comes down to knowing ourselves deeply, and healing that secret part of us. Only by doing so can we become aware of our complicity in having reinforced the very conditions we decry, and begin to develop the capacity to take them apart.

This allows us to feel superior, in a way that can plausibly be defended as righteous. We are only _fighting evil,_ after all.

We maintain a dividing line between the "fundamentally" good and bad; those who deserve our compassion and those who deserve our contempt. That boundary changes throughout life, as we develop increasing empathy. But the maintenance of _any division at all_ indicates that our "devil" still has its foot in the door. The line exists only to justify its continued presence.

The short answer to "why show evildoers compassion?" is that the only alternative is to be evil.
