> _Be kind, for everyone you meet is fighting a great battle._ —Author unknown

> _For so long as the root of wickedness is hidden, it is strong. But when it is recognized, it is dissolved. When it is revealed, it perishes. ... It is powerful because we have not recognized it._ — The Gospel of Philip

We think that hating "bad people" is a sign of the good within us, but it's actually a sign of something _much darker_.

People are only able to cause willful harm due to a kind of self-deception: part of them knows _perfectly well_ that they are doing wrong, but that knowledge is carefully shielded from conscious self-reflection. All they hear are their own clever justifications. It is this secret mechanism that has enabled _all the evil there ever was_ — and it has enabled our own misbehavior too, if we're honest. We have all skirted our conscience before, pretending either that we couldn't hear it or that we didn't have to listen.

When we encounter another person in this state, we don't recognize a fellow human under the sway of a powerful illusion; one that we ourselves are all-too-susceptible to. No, we see them as _fundamentally defective_ and thus worthy of only contempt. Such a person cannot be helped; they can only be subdued or punished — and it is our righteous duty to do so. This is what we tell ourselves, but it is an insidious lie.

A mind that is free of self-deception is simply incapable of feeling hatred, contempt, or self-righteousness. It sees that although others have indeed _chosen_ to follow their darkness in one sense, that choice is ultimately rooted in a kind of profound confusion — one that contempt is secretly designed to _reinforce,_ not alleviate. This is why we mock and shame our enemies: to make them dig in their heels, enabling us to escalate, while plausibly blaming it on them.

We are in fact _choosing_ to act maliciously in one sense, but it is ultimately rooted in a kind of confusion. Part of us _knows_ that it only darkens the world, but we cannot admit this to ourselves. This mind-state is contagious: simply by engaging in it, we induce the same tendency in others. We are secretly inviting them into the same shadowy state that we have licensed ourselves to be in.

The way this works is _insanely_ clever: by pretending to be _fundamentally superior_ to others — feeling contempt — we are telegraphing our own self-deception in a way that is subconsciously obvious to them but hidden from us. This provokes the same pattern in them, while simultaneously giving us permission to judge them for it.

**_Any_ time we choose our ideologies or agendas over our kindness — no matter how "noble" they are — we are confusing our darkness for our Light, and perpetuating this confusion**.

> _And no wonder, for even Satan masquerades as an angel of light. So it is not strange that his ministers also masquerade as ministers of righteousness._ —2 Corinthians 11:14-16

This is the hidden mechanism by which evil spreads, nearly undetected. We all have places in our lives where we lie to ourselves about our true motivations, in subtle and not-so-subtle ways — and by doing so, we covertly authorize others to do the same. It is a kind of secret handshake — one that you can learn to perceive. You and they may be enemies on the surface, but your darkness is secretly _allied._

<p align="center" width="100%"> <img width="300px" src="../img/evil-above-world.png"> </p>

We're not doing this because we are _evil_, per se — although that is what evil ultimately boils down to: the willingness to look away. We're doing it because there are aspects of our mind that feel incomplete, and must provide cover to get it without being judged. **The purpose of all this dark activity to provide that cover** — not just for us, but for everyone; "allies" and "enemies" alike. The darker the state of the world, the easier it becomes to look away from what we are doing. But who is this really serving?

From a certain perspective, this shadowy activity appears sentient; even intelligent. In fact, your darkness and mine aren't just allies: they behave more like appendages of a _distributed malevolent entity_, manipulating all of humanity from within the dark crevices of our own minds; the places where we dare not look. It is what some cultures know as the _Devil_ — and it is as "real" as anything you can touch. It keeps our attention perpetually fixated outward, on all the evil "out there," so that we will never bother to look too closely "in here" — the one place where we have direct power over it; where we could end it, and thereby be of genuine service to others.

<p align="center" width="100%"><img width="300px" src="../img/shared-devil.png"></p>

In more modern terms, it is the _evil global conspiracy_ — that secret cabal responsible for all the world's ills, yet whose full membership remains forever elusive. It is the _primordial_ evil conspiracy, to which all the rest owe their existence, and to which they ultimately filter up. All the conspiracies you can consciously identify "out there" ultimately originate from this shared hidden aspect of mind. They feel "shadowy" because they are outer reflections of our collective unconscious. To believe that you have pinned it down "out there" is to have fallen into its most basic trap.

It is said that the elites are playing us off one another to take attention away from themselves — but the Devil is playing a _much_ bigger game; one in which even the elites are merely pawns. It controls our perception and models of reality so completely that we cannot even _fathom_ its existence. We feel that the dark state of our world must be due to individuals who are fundamentally unlike us, and whose violent elimination would finally bring peace. We never notice where these dark thoughts actually originate from, or the sinister goal we secretly serve simply by entertaining them.

The whole division between "bad people" and "good people"; those "in on it" and those not, is a devious sham. That distinction doesn't exist in reality, but only in your mind, and only to provide it with a bright line beyond which you need not look too carefully at your deepest intentions. Everyone on "this" side of the line must be treated with cloying sweetness — or what we confuse for "compassion" — and everyone on "that" side with cruelty, to prove to ourselves and the world which team we are on, eliminating the need to look too closely into our true intentions.

**To be clear: there are indeed people so thoroughly mired in darkness that "confusion" doesn't begin to describe the depths of their depravity.** But all this means is that their darkness is _especially_ good at seducing us into our shadows, where our minds now have an excuse to sneak in _truckloads_ of our own self-deception in a way that nobody dare question. In this way, hatred for such people is _especially_ evil. A society that is hiding from itself _needs_ them to exist, and will continually produce them to satisfy its dark urges.

All the darkness we have ever leaked into this world still remains, patiently waiting for us to clean it up. If we look carefully, we can discover its distinctive fingerprints imprinted on events distant in time and space; events that we previously never would have dreamed of having any connection to, let alone complicity in. These are the places that trigger us the most; the places that elicit _self-righteous outrage_. This is where we have the most responsibility to clean it up, but also where we feel the most justified in layering on more darkness — and where our "allies" will support us most in doing so.

The more your own darkness is dispelled, the more you see the sense in which nobody could ultimately want to be serving theirs — even those who have convinced themselves and the world that they do. It is a kind of Stockholm syndrome, and hating them is just taking the bait of their captor — humanity's ultimate foe.

The _only_ weapon we have against the darkness is our Light. **Our thoughts, ideologies, and agendas cannot tell us whether we are acting with integrity,** because those can be freely manipulated by our darkness, until we are free of it. Everything comes down to our deep honesty about whether we are acting from our profound Love for all of reality or merely our ideas about "right" and "wrong." This is a Love that excludes nothing and forsakes no-one — but also does not shy away from being fierce (or even violent) when the situation warrants it. This is true compassion, and it has nothing to do with being nice.

This Love is what you ultimately _are_ — what _everyone_ ultimately is. This may sound "woo-woo," but it is something you can learn to perceive directly. You _are_ everyone and everything, in a profound and surprising sense, just pretending that you're not. It is impossible to harm another without ultimately harming yourself, and your desire to forsake others is ultimately an attempt to forsake yourself, because you're not ready to come Home yet.

All self-deception is ultimately rooted in ignorance of this profound truth; in an innocent misperception. Defeating evil therefore comes down to healing it. People cannot be forced to see it, and _trying_ to is madness; a reliable indicator that we ourselves have forgotten. But the more we remember it ourselves, the more our behavior serves as a reminder to them.

**Such behavior need not look anything like "compassion" or "love" in the conventional sense.** It may be fierce or violent, perhaps even looking like mocking and shaming. It may require _apparent_ contempt. But it arises from a very different source, and has a very different impact on all minds involved, consciously or not. This is the secret mechanism by which the _Light_ spreads.

At its fiercest, the Light can look almost indistinguishable from darkness — _almost._ Consciously, they can be hard to tell apart, but our subconscious always knows. Our darkness relies on this apparent difficulty to sneak in. But the most humbling discovery is that it was never actually difficult at all. It was never truly "subconscious": it was always perfectly accessible to consciousness, if only we had looked. But _we chose not to look._ We can remember to look — and to help others do the same.

I wish I had a nugget of wisdom to share about real, practical ways to put this knowledge to use. Alas, I am a mere fledgling myself. All I know is that I wish to stop playing the dark game that we have inherited, and exchange it for a more beautiful one. I only hope that you will join me — and that you will hold my feet to the fire when I (pretend to) forget myself.

> *Nail on the head brother. My most recent mushroom trip (also the largest dose I've ever taken) I became fixated on a news story I had heard that week. About an 8 year old girl from a tribe in the Amazon, who was tied to a tree and burned alive in order to scare her people off their land so it could be logged. I realized that at the moment he did it, whoever lit that gasoline actually felt / thought more or less okay about what he was doing. **And my mind was illuminated with dozens of the parallels between that man's malformed, horrific perceptual / behavioral state, and mine. I saw the same mistakes in value attribution, the same willful ignorance of the consequences of my acts and words. And there was nothing I could do to deny the similarity.***
