We like to think that hating bad people is a sign of the good within us, but it's really a sign of the evil. Bad people are only able to do what they do because of self-deception — the very mechanism that enables our own misbehavior, if we're honest.

If you "probe deeply" enough, you'll find that contempt exists only to enable you to amplify enmity in the world, in a way that appears righteous. In other words, it is pure self-deception — the very thing you hate them for. The truth is that you see an aspect of yourself in them, and it's much easier to fight what's outside than what's inside. 

Treating people with contempt makes them double down, which consciously you hate, but subconsciously you love — because the more evil they become, the more righteous you get to feel. This behavior injects darkness into the very fabric of reality, where it propagates outward, until you can plausibly deny all complicity.

It is very hard to admit that we're doing this, but once we do, we finally understand what prevents "bad people" from confronting _their_ self-deception. From here, we discover that the whole world is locked in an insidious cycle of gleefully shoving each other into the dark to avoid confronting the darkness within.

When this dynamic is seen in its full horrific glory, it appears so diabolically clever that it feels almost intelligently designed. In a sense, it is. The biggest shock, however, is discovering that the "designer" lives within our own mind. _Part of us has always been in on the archetypal "evil conspiracy."_ Our greatest responsibility is to heal that part of ourselves. 

What remains is an impossibly fierce love for the world. It sees clearly that our true enemy is not other people, but the evil hidden in all of our minds. Yet it is not naive: it knows that fighting people is sometimes the only way to fight evil. The effect of fighting evil with benevolent intent ripples out in the same way that our malice did, but with the opposite effect.

Until we recognize this distinction, every attempt to "fight evil" is secretly a bid to create more. I wish I could say that afterward, you magically become a "good person" who knows how to fight evil, but it's not true. All I know now is that I'm a profound hypocrite with a whole lot of work to do. I have no right to lecture anyone on morality. I just want to share what I've seen.

It is said that evil wins when the good do nothing. That is surely true, but even worse than letting evil win is secretly joining forces with it. May we at least stop doing that.
