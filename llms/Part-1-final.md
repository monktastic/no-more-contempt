# Part I: The Mechanism

## The Limbo State

Think back to a time when you skirted your conscience—acted against your own deepest values while telling yourself it was okay. In that moment, part of you knew _perfectly well_ that you were doing wrong, but you shielded that knowledge from conscious awareness, so that it didn't _feel_ wrong. The knowledge existed in a kind of limbo state—a bizarre, paradoxical schism of mind, in which you both _knew_ and yet somehow _didn't._ All you could hear were your own clever justifications.

We do this as a kind of defense. In ourselves, it feels like an understandable flaw—but when others act from it, we see them as fundamentally defective. When we see it in others, we think: this is just who they are.

Notice how the limbo state was itself in limbo: you've always known about this mechanism but likely never brought it fully into conscious awareness. It's extremely obvious when you see it.

Think back to a time when you mocked or shamed someone. You probably told yourself you were doing it to help—to correct their behavior, to protect others, to make the world better. But if you're honest, part of you wanted to make them feel bad, quite independent of any good it would do.

And yet they sensed it anyway. They could tell you were relishing their suffering.

How? You barely knew it yourself. It was buried deep, shielded from your own conscious awareness.

And yet somehow it reached them.

This weakens their faith in humanity. The world just got a little darker. So they feel more of an urge to protect themselves—which often means more self-deception. You perceive this as inherent badness. _Strike one_.

What you see is a person who became defensive in response to your righteous behavior, instead of introspecting and thanking you for your wisdom. Instead, they're implicitly accusing _you_ of being evil. _Strike two._

Part of you suspects some truth in their accusation. But how could they possibly know about your hidden malice? You barely knew it yourself. So their accusation can't be based on anything real. They must be projecting their own darkness onto you. _Strike three._

This person is fundamentally defective. The world is even worse than you thought.

You now feel _more_ justified in your self-serving behaviors, while being less likely to recognize them as such.

But part of you suspects this, too—that the whole thing was a ruse. So you bury it even _harder_...

---

Your malice was hidden from you but visible to them. _Both halves were necessary._

If they couldn't sense it, the mechanism wouldn't work—they wouldn't get defensive, wouldn't give you permission to write them off.

If you _could_ sense it, the mechanism wouldn't work—you'd feel too guilty to follow through.

The hidden intention to cause harm was somehow enough to actually cause it. Almost as if it was telegraphed to them while being kept hidden from you.

But you certainly didn't consciously intend it.

And yet it happened exactly as if you had.

---

This pattern doesn't just show up when you mock people directly:

"Play stupid games, win stupid prizes." "Fuck around and find out." "Darwin Award!" when someone dies in an easily-preventable way.

These aren't technically wrong—that's what makes them so insidious. There's satisfaction beneath the words. Casual cruelty.

Each time, the contempt gets easier. More automatic. More necessary.

---

When you mocked them, they weren't just reacting to your malice. They were reacting to something bigger—the whole dark pattern, including your attempt to hide it from yourself.

And you _knew_ they knew. Which you had to hide. And they knew that, too.

Have you felt that before, while doing it? That you both secretly know what's really going on? That you're both aware of the game being played, but neither of you can acknowledge it without breaking the spell?

You did this while genuinely believing you were helping.

---

Everyone does this.

Not "everyone has flaws." **Everyone executes this exact pattern.**

The same hiding. The same transmission. The same three strikes. The same result: both people worse.

Think about someone you know. Different personality, different background. Now think about a time they felt contempt for someone.

They did the exact same thing you just did, didn't they?

We all just know how to do it.

---

And here's what you need to sit with.

You knew this would make things worse.

Not in retrospect. Not after thinking about it. In the moment—while you were doing it—some part of you knew that contempt would darken their world, strengthen their defenses, make them worse.

You've always known this.

Every single time you've felt contempt for someone, part of you has known it would make things worse, not better.

And yet you did it anyway.

Everyone does.

This isn't some subtle insight. This isn't advanced psychology. Every single person knows what contempt feels like to receive. Every single person knows it makes you defensive. Every single person has seen someone get more entrenched when mocked. This is completely, utterly obvious.

So why is nobody talking about it? Why has no one named this clearly? How have we all gone our whole lives doing this without someone pointing it out?

And yet we keep doing it. While hiding from ourselves that we know what we're doing.

Why?

Why would you keep doing something you know makes things worse?

Why does everyone execute this exact same pattern?

Why do we all hide it from ourselves while doing it?

Why is nobody talking about this?

And what else have you been hiding from yourself?
