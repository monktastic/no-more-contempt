In your most honest, authentic moments, don't you see the good in others more easily? Where does that perception go the rest of the time?

It actually never goes anywhere. We just *turn away* from it for various reasons, so that it seems like we can't see it. And we're never fully turned *toward* it, either—until, perhaps, enlightenment.

If you *were* fully turned toward it, can you envision how you might be able to perceive this same capacity in literally everyone else—including the people you now see as evil?

So it's not missing from their conscious experience either. They're just turned away from it harder—which means that a deeply hidden part of them can always see it in *you,* too. 

I know this may be hard to imagine, but watch where it goes.

If I can see it in you, and you can see the part of me *that sees it in you*, then we have a perfect hall of mirrors: I know that you know that I know... *ad infinitum*.

# Part 1

I knowingly darkened the world.

Lean into the horror of having knowingly darkened the world, and yet how it came from a fundamentally innocent place (genuine desire to fight evil). 

And then really emphasize that we're just pulling this out of limbo, which means that we already know it. And once the knowing is made conscious it cannot survive. Darkening the person's mind was a self-fulfilling prophecy. And yet it may have made things seem better locally even though it harmed things globally—which is part of why we trust it.

This thing thrives in the shadows. Survives on plausible deniability.

Connect it to externalized costs (I benefited myself in this interaction at the world's expense, but wrote it off). This is a microcosm of what's happening on our planet.

The deepest need is to see the problems of the world as due to something foreign to myself.

Those things we were serving, now we can name them better.

"Here's the thing: I didn't teach you something new just now. You already knew it. How do I know? Because I know you recognized it. That flash of 'oh fuck'—that wasn't learning, that was remembering.
And you know that I know you knew it. And I know that you know that I know. This is common knowledge—but held in limbo. We've all been maintaining this collective self-deception together.
My goal isn't to convince you of something novel. It's to pull this out of limbo—to make explicit what we all already implicitly know. Once it's explicit common knowledge, the pattern has nowhere to hide. Not in you, not in me, not in civilization.
That's why describing it so carefully matters. I'm not building an argument—I'm removing the plausible deniability it feeds on. For all of us. Forever."

# Part 2

Part is s about subtlety, depth, cleverness, pervasiveness, and reach.
How it snuck into everything, overwhelming all the good I did.

The limbo state isn't binary.

Had not a suspicion but a recognition that the other person could only do wrong due to self-deception.

This is what my conscience had been trying to warn me about. That part of me part of me was trying to darken the world. To make my enemy fit what I needed them to be.

Start of part 2 is that the purpose of this thing is to darken the world while making you feel you want that. When inspected carefully enough you see that it has the felt sense of trying to darken the world as though this is its purpose. There was another part that was trying to warn you about this.

That part of me that would rather deliver righteous vengeance than see people change--that's what was in control. I wanted to see them hurt. It was malevolent. By revealing itself to them, it knew how they would see me.

Every act was meant to degrade the environment in such a way that it could hide itself better. And every act came with some plausible deniability. Every act could be made to look almost identical to an action with integrity. But people could sense it. They just couldn't prove it. It's this unprovability that makes it so sinister

Show secret handshake?

It spreads itself through personal interactions and then it protects itself at a civilizational scale.
