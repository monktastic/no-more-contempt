# Part 1: Limbo!

Have you ever been so angry you didn’t care what it destroyed—as long as it made them _feel it_? In that moment, it felt righteous, didn’t it?

And then think of a time you acted from fierce integrity, even when it cost you something real. That felt righteous, too.

Same word, opposite meaning.

Both felt like “you” at the time—but which feels more like the real you now? Deep down; in your most authentic moments, do you long for a more beautiful world—or a more hellish one?

In that case, what was in control when that violent rage felt like "you"?

---

Now let's look at this on a smaller scale.

Think back to a moment you felt contemptuously judged by another person. No matter how "right" they may have been; even if you *knew* you had done wrong, something felt *off* about them, didn't it? You could tell they weren't coming from a good place. How?

Now think of a time when someone set you straight with profound integrity, seemingly getting nothing out of it themselves. Even if it stung your ego; made you lose face, you had no desire to take revenge, did you? Why not? What were they serving?

Now flip the tables.

Think of a time when *you* contemptuously judged someone. Even if you made it look civil, they dug in their heels, didn't they? And somewhere inside, that resistance confirmed what you already believed.

And finally, a time when you corrected someone with integrity yourself. Perhaps you had to do it with more ferocity; more violence than in the previous case—and yet something in you knew it would ultimately bring *more* peace, right? How did you know?

---

Whatever you were serving in your moment of integrity, and what the person who set you straight was serving: even if you knew nothing else about them—their politics, their religion, their creed—didn't it feel like you were serving the same thing? What is that?

And in those moments of contempt—didn't those feel like they were serving the same thing, too? What's *that*? It's not just your individual egos.

Integrity feels aligned from the inside and outside.

Contempt feels righteous on the inside, and dark, dirty, manipulative on the outside.

There's a reason it works that way.

---
## The Need

Notice how the world makes more sense when we know our enemies really are bad—genuinely, irredeemably bad. It's not that we *want* them to be, per se, but if they weren't? We might be forced to question whether we've been part of the problem all along. And that would be... not great.

A need that deep wouldn't just sit still. It would bias us to interpret things in ways that favor it. Such as making us perceive our enemies digging in as proof that they're bad—instead of recognizing how we'd do the exact same thing in their shoes. Which would make them even _worse_—which would justify treating them worse, making them worse still...

This would certainly be an elegant way of satisfying our need—as long as we never noticed our own hand in it. But that feels a bit dark, doesn't it?

Still, let’s follow it. Suppose there _were_ a part of us devoted to maintaining this loop—meeting the need while hiding its existence. How would it work?

---

First, what would such behavior would feel like from the outside?

If someone _needed_ you to confirm their suspicions about you—while burying that need so deeply that even they could barely sense it—yet on the surface felt righteous and justified?

That would feel dark, dirty, manipulative.

Looking back on times you’ve received contempt, doesn’t this capture it? Some part of them seemed bent on proving itself right, but they couldn’t quite admit it. Wanting to hurt you, while needing to feel innocent—almost like a ruse.

Can you feel how that inability to admit it is part of what made it work? And it's hard to fake that degree of inability. It's as if part of them really isn't seeing it, right?

There’s a kind of hiddenness you can sense in moments like that—something in them _revealing_ itself to you, even as it stays carefully hidden from them.

---

But how does it do that?

To better understand, we need to broaden our scope.

---
## Conscience

Have you ever done something you knew was wrong at the time, but couldn't fully admit that to yourself until later?

While you were doing it, wasn't your mind creating justifications for why it wasn't *really* wrong?

Notice an asymmetry here: the part that knew it was wrong—your conscience—wasn't trying to justify itself. It just... *was*. The justifications weren't there to convince *it*; they were there to convince *you* that it was just one more voice among the noise.

But it wasn't.

We *know* we'd lose a direct confrontation with our conscience. All we can do is ignore it better. So that's what you did—and yet some part of you sensed this wouldn't end well, didn't it? 

You might have convinced yourself you didn't "really" know—right up until you were able to admit it, at which point you saw that you *always had*.

Notice this: both halves—the undeniable wrongness and the conviction of rightness—were actually conscious **the entire time**. Not hidden in some unconscious realm waiting to emerge. Right there. You just kept your attention carefully turned away.

---

## Limbo

That knowledge existed in a kind of "limbo state": a bizarre schism of mind in which we know something—*consciously*—and yet are **sure** we don't... until we retroactively discover that we always did.

*That* is the "off" feeling you're sensing when you're on the receiving end of contempt—that the person is hiding something from themselves. And you instinctively know what that means—because the only time you do that is when you're ignoring your *own* conscience.

And it makes you dig in.

What things might you be hiding in limbo *right now*? How would you ever know it?

The part of us causing all this doesn't want us asking these questions. Notice what happens when you try to look at it directly. Feel that pull toward guilt and shame? As long as you're busy feeling bad about your misbehavior, you won't stop to examine the thing itself. You won't ask: what even IS this? Do I actually want it?

---

You *know* there's a way to correct others without making them worse.

You know contempt makes people dig in.

I didn't teach you either of these. You recognized them yourself in the opening.

It may feel like you forget them while feeling contempt, but you don't. That's limbo at work—so effective it _feels_ like forgetting. If it felt like deliberate hiding, it wouldn't work. And if you were *fully* conscious of it, you couldn't do it.

---

When our enemies get worse? Not only will they fight *us* harder, they'll spread that toxicity to others, darkening the world as a whole.

And that time you recalled having done wrong—wasn't it hard to admit because you knew you had benefited yourself at the expense of others? You don't want to live in a world where people do that.

Both led toward a world you don't want.

Now remember that moment of white-hot rage from the opening—where you didn't care what it destroyed? Looking back now, doesn't it feel like something else had taken control of the wheel? Like "whoa, that wasn't *me*?"

Same thing, different form.

So here we have something that doesn't feel like "me," until it takes control—at which point it feels like me, works against my values, and makes me feel justified or even righteous. Then it covers it all up with guilt and shame, so that I never recognize what really happened.

But it gets worse.

---

The person you treated with contempt—consider how things looked from their perspective:

>*Oh, so you're a "good person"? I can literally **see** the darkness in you—that contemptuous part you're not admitting to yourself. You're just another hypocrite who thinks they're special. Why should I listen to my conscience when you won't listen to yours? Fuck that.*

So they now feel powerfully licensed to ignore theirs further. What good is a conscience when it can't protect us from such a dark, twisted world?

Isn't that why we disobey it in the first place? We see an uncaring world, and feel that we can only get our needs met by harboring a bit of our own darkness. Not because we're bad people, but because we feel this shitty world forced our hand. Whether true or not, that's the feeling, isn't it?

So the thing that made us ignore our own conscience has now made them feel more compelled to ignore theirs.

And since we don't know that we caused this, we see it as proof they're as bad as we feared. In fact, they're accusing *us* of being evil when we were only trying to help—making them well and truly defective.

There's no way to defeat such monsters as long as we're still clinging to our morals like chumps. 

*The kid gloves must come off.*

---

## The Darkness

This... thing. This *dark* part.

You have one, I have one. I sensed yours, and felt compelled to attack. By unleashing mine.

And it worked... on the surface. It shut you up. Dominated you. Scared you into hiding.

But under the covers? Something much darker has taken place.

Yours has been strengthened. And mine gave it exactly what it needed to do that. To cozy itself up to you further.

We will both leave feeling like we need to give this thing *more* control. Broaden its purview. We will be less likely to notice the self-serving aspects of our own actions and agendas, and more likely to notice them in others. So we will do this dance more often—and not just with each other.

This thing. This *darkness*.

It's spreading itself through us. 

And the more we give it control, the more we feel like it *is* us.

---

## The Spread

Notice something astonishing about how this happened.

1. My darkness needs you to dig in your heels, to make you the bad guy.
2. Its nature is to hide itself from me while revealing itself to you.
3. My darkness being hidden from me while revealed to you is enough to make you dig in.

In other words, simply by existing in its natural way, it accomplished its goal.

Its nature **is** its execution. It spreads itself just by its mode of existence.

What we are dealing with—infected by—is like a self-executing parasite that spreads itself by perfectly evading detection. Not *while* evading it: *by* evading it.

---
## Hall of Mirrors

What does this look like in practice? The mechanism is truly mind-bending. Don't worry if you can't follow it all in detail.

In moments of deep integrity; the closer you are to your conscience—isn't it more obvious that other people are only caught in the same deep trap you are? (Don't worry about exceptions for now. We'll get to them soon.) That's what makes you want to help them in those moments, instead of shoving them deeper in.

Which means you already know they have a conscience—and that the closer they get to theirs, the more obvious all of this would be to them. That this is just how humans work.

And it's not that you ever literally forget this. It's always there, but *deep* in limbo. That's why it feels unconscious, or maybe like you never knew it. 

But then this part of you must know that about them, too: that somewhere hidden in their conscious mind, *they* know we're all stuck in the same trap.

And like two sets of eyes gazing at each other, each sees that the other sees that the other sees...

Which gives rise to what game theorists call *common knowledge*: we all know that we all know that we all know... *ad infinitum*... that we're not fundamentally superior to others. It's just that this knowledge is sitting in limbo for most of us.

Whew. So...

When I even subtly accuse you of being *inherently bad*, not only do I know that I'm lying: I know that *you* know it, and that you know I know it, *ad infinitum*. I'm secretly revealing my own hypocrisy, making you see *me* as a bad person—which we also both know that the other knows etc.

This gives rise to a kind of hall of mirrors effect. Of course you're not *thinking* about any of this. But you *feel* something like: "we both know what I'm really doing here, and that it's hidden so well from me that I can never be forced to admit it."

And *that's* what makes you dig in. The maddening hypocrisy of knowing I'm judging you for being the kind of person who does the very thing I'm doing right now in order to prove that you're the kind of person who does...

*(For curious analytical readers, a more thoroughly developed explanation is available in the footnote with the same title.)*

## The Secret Handshake

There's a simpler way of looking at all this.

When I see you as *fundamentally bad,* I'm temporarily forgetting that you're only infected with the same parasite I am—that the badness is not intrinsic to your nature. And when this happens, I can't *help* but want to shove you deeper in—strengthening yours.

On the surface, you and I will feel even more like bitter enemies after this. But it's actually a secret handshake between your darkness and mine—to keep this world bound in darkness; paving the way for more.

This is *why* I see you as bad: my parasite is making me see yours as intrinsic, so that I'll feel compelled to do this. I'll feel like I've finally caught hold of WHAT'S WRONG WITH THE WORLD so that I can punish it. In a sense, I really have—but far from punishing it, I'm doing its very bidding.

Who on earth would believe such a ridiculous thing?

And that is why it works.

---

## Altered perception

When I say my world becomes darker as a result, I don't mean it in some abstract sense. After this encounter, I don't just *think* you're bad, I now *see* it; *feel* it more clearly than before. I then subtly override more of my morals to ensure you don't win—but it feels like a righteous necessity.

This is the mechanism that deepens self-deception. Your darkness manufactures "external evidence" so you "know" you're not deceiving yourself. The very faculties you'd use to detect it are compromised.

_Of course_ my darkness wouldn't let me unveil it by thinking harder or more clearly about it—or else humanity would have solved this problem long ago.

Remember what it was like when you were feeling contempt? You weren't thinking "I'm feeling contempt." Your mind was filled with justifications for why this wasn't _real_ darkness; or why, if it was, it was still necessary to defeat a greater evil.

But it was all a lie.

**While you're in limbo, you cannot detect that your thoughts are being manipulated in furtherance of a world you don't actually want—and no amount of thinking harder will fix it.**

Yet there's a part of us that *always knows whether we're in limbo, and what we are hiding.* It's closely connected to our conscience, but that word barely scratches the surface.

There is an aspect of your mind that never falls for your shenanigans, and it is always available. It's the part that feels most like "you." In your moments of deepest integrity, you don't have to justify anything to yourself; you just *know.* You know what you're in service to, even if you can't name it.

Numerous traditions have pointed to this part of us—but when described in its entirety, it begins to sound mystical or spiritual. 

Does some part of you wince or cringe at that kind of language? Which part of us would benefit from keeping us suspicious of fully unveiling the one aspect that can actually detect and defeat our darkness?

---

## Shielding

Most of us are naturally averse to harming others. If you feel into why, it's because you can see something of yourself in them. You know what it's like to hurt, and you don't really want that for others.

But the more the darkness takes ahold, the more your perception shifts. The less you can see yourself in them—again, not just at a conceptual level, but a perceptual one. This doesn't happen evenly across everyone you see. We naturally have an easier time feeling it for some people than others.

But the desire to cause harm *requires* this perceptual shielding, which is the natural result of the progressive darkening of the mind. This is why our enemies become easier to hate and harm.

And the more we shield ourselves to cause harm, the more harm we're causing, which requires even more shielding. Each layer makes the next easier.

It can become a runaway process with *astonishing* speed under the right (wrong) circumstances.

---

What would a person look like if they didn't stop this process in time? Someone fully unmoored from conscience; totally possessed by darkness, causing pain to others without compunction? Fully committed to their righteous ideologies instead of to the actual, living, breathing humans around them? Someone you couldn't reach with words, because their whole mind is hijacked?

We'd call them *evil,* of course.

And then we'd treat them with contempt.

---

And here's what we miss: even at that extreme, that original pain of harming others hasn't really disappeared. It never becomes less conscious, exactly—just better hidden. They're still turning away from the same recognition we are, just far more completely.

(If you dare to get a taste for this, try giving someone a dehumanizing glare. It's difficult, isn't it? Sends a shudder down the spine. What are they perceiving in you when you do this? What does it feel like from the inside? That's what shielding feels and looks like. And the shudder? That's your conscience—your alarm system warning you.)

What evil people do, and the contempt we feel for them: same essence, radically different scales. Theirs is as known-but-hidden from them as ours is from us. And they mutually reinforce each other.

---

## Integrity

Let me be clear: we are not saying "don't judge (or fight) evil people."

The part of us that wants to confuse clean anger with the contemptuous kind? That's the darkness.

To let contempt for beliefs and behaviors bleed into contempt for people? Darkness.

Fighting evil with fierce, unflinching integrity—that's what actually works. We'll explore it further later.

---

As you may have guessed, the extent to which our minds are colonized by darkness lies on a continuum. And unless you are enlightened, it's not zero.

**This means our cognitive apparatus is essentially _always_ hijacked to some degree. Our thoughts are always being subtly manipulated in furtherance of a world we don't actually want.**

Right now. As you read this. Some tiny part of your mind is editing your perception to maintain some fiction that serves this pattern.

Now imagine: what does a world look like when this is true for _everyone_?

If you can feel even the slightest trace of malice, contempt, or self-righteousness toward _anyone_—that **is** the darkness operating in you. If you were face to face with them, it would be very hard to avoid letting it leak out, thereby strengthening theirs.

And even if you were somehow free of all such sentiments, there are still much subtler forms woven into your perception of reality itself. But we'll get to that later.

---
## A Note on Responsibility

It feels shameful to admit when we've been doing this, doesn't it?

This thing—it protects itself by using our own morality against us. You feel ashamed because you *don't* want to harm others. This makes it hard to look clearly at what you've been doing—which means you can't inspect it carefully enough to see how it takes control.

This also connects to how we've been calling it a "thing" that is "using us."

If I treat it as an external entity, then that both absolves me of responsibility and gives me one more thing to feel contempt for—which just lets it slip in the back door. This is the trap a lot of religion falls into: treating the Devil as something "out there" that I'm valiantly fighting against—never realizing that my own self-righteousness *is* it.

On the other hand, if I take it as completely me, then there will always be this layer of shame protecting it.

There's a middle way. It is certainly me—and it is *you*, when you fall into it—and yet there's also a sense in which it's not. It's more like a pattern we fall into; a trap that's always waiting.

It is this combination—holding my feet to the fire while also pointing me past that part of myself to what is deeper—that empowers me to heal it. That is the gift the medicine offered me. It is the gift I can offer others. And it is what I hope this book offers you.


## Epilogue

So now you've seen it. The pattern that uses our own goodness against us. The mechanism that makes us accomplices in darkening the world while feeling righteous—and that somehow cooperates _across_ us, even when we're certain we're enemies.

But notice: I didn't discover this pattern, or even teach it to you. **You already knew it.** It was just in limbo.

All this stuff is in collective civilizational limbo as implicit common knowledge. We all know it, and that everyone else does, etc.—but it's still somehow hidden.

By naming it explicitly, something fundamental changes. Now when you see this pattern operating—in yourself or others—you don't have to maintain the polite fiction. You can point at it. We can point at it _together_. Not out of contempt, but out of integrity.

Like the kid's words in the Emperor's New Clothes tale, this gives us something to point to and say: "See? We can all stop pretending now."

This thing thrives in the shadows. It survives on plausible deniability. Once it becomes explicit common knowledge, the pattern has nowhere to hide. Not in you, not in me, not in civilization.

That's what this book is attempting to do.

But so far, we've just identified the individual and interpersonal level. What happens when entire societies do this _together_? That's where things get truly terrifying—and where the stakes become existential.

## Hall of Mirrors (unpacked)

*(This section is dense and analytical. It's not necessary to understand, but may be interesting to analytical readers.)*

Let's unpack the hall of mirrors recursion more carefully.

When I nastily judge you for being a bad person, part of me already knows it's a ruse—that I'm trying to make you dig in. But if I were fully aware of it, it would be too obvious and you'd fail to take the bait. But revealing that I'm trying, while hiding it from myself? Perfect.

It's difficult to convey the full genius of this ruse, but let me try. Imagine you're on the receiving end of this.

Remember: they want to cause harm and need it to look innocent. So they want you to *feel* their malice, but must keep it plausibly deniable. And for it to be *truly* deniable, they must hide it from themselves. And they need you to *see* they're hiding it, so that you know your accusations will bounce off. So they must reveal their **hiding** to you—but mustn't let themselves know that. Which means they must hide their own hiding...

If you trace the logic carefully, you'll see it results in a recursion of hiding-yet-revealing. The result is a kind of hall-of-mirrors effect that essentially conveys: "we both know what I'm really doing, but I know you can't accuse me of it without sounding crazy." And that **is** the malice.

It's not that the *first* step was them telegraphing you their malice. I only used that word to make it more clear. They were just conveying their *intention* to make you the bad guy, and the recursion took care of delivering on that intention.

This requires a careful choreographing of our "conscious" and limbo parts, so that they can maintain plausible deniability at each level, while also making sure you know what's really happening. And this dance is orchestrated by *both of our dark aspects in tandem*. 

It's not that we *consciously* know the game we're playing, in the usual sense of that word. But I can't stress enough that limbo is in fact conscious, just sometimes *extremely* well hidden. So we both knew it, and that the other knew it, etc. And that's what makes it work.

Looked at another way: my darkness is revealing itself to yours, knowing it will provoke you into seeing me as evil, while hiding itself from me, so that I will take your resistance as proof that *you* are—thereby strengthening both of ours. It's a kind of secret handshake between our dark parts, enabled by common knowledge.

This description of the effect requires both malice and the hiding of malice—but they aren't actually two things. Malice *requires* a kind of hiding. And actually, the initial seed isn't even malice, but something we'll explore later, that makes it all fit together even more satisfyingly.
