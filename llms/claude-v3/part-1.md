# Part 1: Limbo!

Have you ever been so angry you’d let the whole world burn to satisfy your white-hot rage? In that moment, didn’t it feel _righteous_?

Now think of a time you acted with fierce integrity, even at great cost to yourself. That felt righteous, too.

Same word, totally different experiences.

Both felt like “you” at the time—but which feels more like the real you now? Deep down; in your most authentic moments, do you long for a more beautiful world—or a more hellish one?

In that case, what was in control when that violent rage felt like "you"?

---

Now imagine this in smaller moments.

Think back to a moment you felt contemptuously judged by another person. No matter how "right" they may have been; even if you *knew* you had done wrong, something felt *off* about them, didn't it? You could tell they weren't coming from a good place. How?

Now think of a time when someone set you straight with profound integrity, seemingly getting nothing out of it themselves. Even if it stung your ego; even if it made you lose face, you had no desire to take revenge, did you? Why not?

Now flip the tables.

Think of a time when *you* contemptuously judged someone. Even if you made it look civil, they still dug in their heels, didn't they? Didn't that feel like proof they were *bad?*

And finally, a time when you corrected someone with integrity yourself. Perhaps you had to do it with more ferocity; more violence than in the previous case—and yet something in you knew it would ultimately bring *more* peace to the world, didn't you? *How* did you know?

---

Whatever you were serving in your moment of integrity, and what the person who set you straight was serving: even if you knew nothing about them—their politics, their religion, their creed—did it *feel* like you were serving the same thing? What is that?

And in those moments of contempt—didn't those feel like they were serving the same thing, too? What's *that*?

Integrity feels the same from the inside and outside. But contempt feels righteous on the inside, and dark, dirty, manipulative from the outside.

There's a reason for that.

---
## The Need

Notice how the world makes more sense when we know our enemies truly are genuinely, irredeemably bad. It's not that we *want* them to be that way, but knowing they are alleviates a certain psychological pressure—one that's near the core of our identity.

And a need that deep doesn't just sit still; it moves us. It would shape our behavior in subtle ways—small things that help confirm our suspicions. Of course, sometimes those behaviors might make our enemies slightly *worse*—which would then justify us treating them worse, making them even worse...

Which would be an elegant way of satisfying the need—as long as we weren't aware of our role in it. But that seems a bit dark.

Still, let's investigate how things would unfold if it were true. Imagine there *were* a part of us dedicated to meeting this need, while carefully preventing us from seeing it. How, exactly, would it accomplish its goal?

---

First let's see what such behavior would look like from the outside. 

If someone secretly needed you to confirm their suspicions of you, while burying this knowledge so deeply that even they barely knew it—while feeling righteous on the surface?

That combination would feel dark, dirty, manipulative.

Looking back on when you received contempt, doesn't this capture what it felt like? That some part of them was trying to prove itself right, but they couldn't quite admit it to themselves? Wanting to hurt you while needing to feel innocent?

If they were fully aware of this, it would land differently for you, wouldn't it? That knowledge would leak out, and the jig would be up.

You can sense a kind of hiddenness—like something in them was *showing* itself to you while keeping itself carefully hidden from them.

---

That's already pretty strange. But it gets stranger: making you worse is only a subordinate goal on the way to a much larger score for this thing.

To see how, we need to broaden our scope.

---

## Conscience

Have you ever done something you knew was wrong at the time, but couldn't fully admit that to yourself until later? Maybe you said something cruel to boost your ego, or took credit for someone else's work, or cheated on a test (or even partner).

While you were doing it, wasn't your mind creating justifications for why it wasn't *really* wrong?

Notice an asymmetry here: the part that knew it was wrong—your conscience—wasn't trying to justify itself. It just... *was*. And the justifications weren't there to convince *it*; they were there to convince *you*—that it was just one more voice among the chaos, equal with all the others.

But it wasn't.

Try imagining doing something you know is wrong—_fully_ knowing it's wrong, with no rationalization—and doing it anyway. Can you even picture it?

We *know* we can't win in a direct confrontation with our conscience. Nor can we silence it. All we can do is ignore it better.

So that's what you did—and yet some part of you sensed that this wouldn't end well, didn't it? That this deception would come back to bite you, even if nobody else ever knew?

Notice how both halves—the undeniable wrongness and the certainty of rightness—were actually conscious **the entire time**. Not hidden in some unconscious realm waiting to emerge. Right there. You just kept your attention carefully turned away.

You might have convinced yourself you didn't "really" know, right up until you were able to admit it—at which point you saw that you always had.

---

## Limbo

In this way, knowledge can exist in a kind of "limbo state": a bizarre schism of mind in which we know something—*consciously*—and yet are **sure** we don't... until we retroactively discover that we did.

_That_ is the "off" feeling you're sensing when you're on the receiving end of contempt—that I'm hiding something from myself. And you instinctively know what that means—because the only time you do that is when you're disobeying your _own_ conscience. And the lack of this is what you sense as integrity in others.

What things might you be hiding in limbo *right now*? How would you ever know it?

The part of us causing all this doesn't want us to ask this. In fact, it wouldn't even want us thinking about it. It would rather we just feel guilt and shame for our misbehavior, so that we would never bother to ask: what even is this thing, and do we really want it?

---

Thinking back to when you felt contempt for your enemy, notice how the same mechanism was at play. You already know contempt makes your enemies worse, don't you? And you don't forget this while you're doing it—you just hide it from yourself.

And there's more.

You also know there's a way to combat your enemies without making them worse—you recalled it in the opening. So what purpose did the contempt actually serve? *That knowledge is there too, but still hidden in limbo.*

---

When we stop and reflect, it's obvious we don't want our enemies to become worse. Not only will they fight *us* harder, they'll spread that toxicity to others, darkening the world as a whole.

And that time you did wrong—wasn't it hard to admit because you knew you had benefited yourself at the expense of others? Maybe you even recognized: "I've just given permission for *others* to act selfishly, too." Again: darker world.

Isn't that in direct conflict with your conscious values?

And remember that moment of white-hot rage from the opening—where you'd let the whole world burn? Looking back now, doesn't it feel like something else had taken control of the wheel? Like "whoa, that wasn't _me_?"

Same thing here, just milder.

So here we have something that doesn't feel like "me," until it takes control—at which point it pretends to be me, works against my values, and makes me feel justified or even righteous. Then it covers it all up with guilt and shame, so that I never recognize what really happened.

---

The person you treated with contempt—consider how things looked from their perspective:

>*Oh, so you're a "good person"? I can literally **see** the darkness in you—that contemptuous part you're not admitting to yourself. You're just another hypocrite who thinks they're special. Why should I listen to my conscience when you won't listen to yours? Fuck that.*

So they now feel powerfully licensed to ignore theirs further. What good is it listening to a conscience when it can't protect us from such a dark, twisted world?

Isn't that is why we disobey it in the first place? We see an uncaring world, and feel that we can only get our needs met by harboring a bit of our own darkness? Not because we're bad people, but because we feel this shitty world forced our hand?

The thing that made us ignore our own conscience has now darkened their world so that they feel more compelled to ignore theirs.

But since we don't know that we caused this, we see their resistance as proof they're as bad as we feared. In fact, they're accusing *us* of being evil when we're the good guys. Man, people are even worse than we thought!

There's no way to defeat such monsters as long as we're still clinging to our morals like chumps. 

*The kid gloves must come off.*

---

This... thing. It has tricked us into giving it more control while being less likely to notice that we have. And these aren't actually two separate facts, but two sides of the same coin: it is *only* possible to hand over control when you don't realize that's what you're doing. Because it feels so... fucking... righteous. Like you're cutting through all the bullshit and finally seeing clearly. 

It feels like *you.*

And it did exactly the same thing for them, didn't it?

And now they'll do it for others. And so will we. And it will all ripple.

The darkness was never fighting itself. It's only pretending to, so it can keep using us.

---

## Hall of Mirrors

But how, exactly, does it do that? The mechanism is truly mind-bending.

When I accuse you of being a bad person—whether explicitly or implicitly—my darkness is revealing itself to you while hiding itself from me. It knows your darkness recognizes this pattern, because it's the essence of how darkness operates.

Now, before continuing: since my darkness isn't truly unconscious—it's just in limbo—I'll switch to "I" and "you." This makes it both more honest and damning.

So: I know you know what I'm doing. And you *know* that. And I *know* you know that. Isn't that what it feels like? That we both know exactly what's going on here, but that I'll deny it if called out—and in a way that's actually plausible to everyone but you? "I'm only fighting evil!"

I'm evoking what game theorists call *common knowledge*—we both know that we both know that we both know, *ad infinitum*—while also making sure it's unprovable from the outside. So this plausible deniability *also* becomes common knowledge.

It's a self-sealing trap, making it the perfect crime. And the only reason I could *evoke* that common knowledge is because it already existed: *we all know this is how it really works.*

Now, crucially: notice how on the surface, you and I feel even more like enemies. But the reason my darkness flashed itself to you was to **strengthen** yours. It was a secret handshake disguised as a fight.

Also notice how the unprovability is a feature, not a bug. It is a core aspect of how darkness operates.

*(For curious analytical readers, a more thoroughly developed explanation is available in the footnote with the same title.)*

## !!

What just happened here is worth lingering on.

I didn't discover this pattern, or even teach it to you. You already knew it. But it was _implicit_ common knowledge: we all knew it, and that everyone else did, etc.—but we all pretended not to know it. And that pretense is what gives it power.

By naming it explicitly, something fundamental changes. Now when you see this pattern operating—in yourself or others—you don't have to maintain the polite fiction. You can point at it. We can point at it together. Not out of contempt! But out of integrity.

Explicit common knowledge is much, much harder to hide from.

Like the kid's words in the Emperor's New Clothes tale, this gives us something to point to and say: "See? We can all stop pretending now."

That's what much of this book is actually attempting to do.

When I say my world becomes darker as a result, I don't mean it in some abstract sense. After this encounter, I don't just *think* you're bad, I now *see* it; *feel* it more clearly than before. I then subtly override more of my morals to ensure you don't win—but it feels like a righteous necessity.

This isn't a separate mechanism from the one that deepens my capacity for self-deception, but the core mechanism behind it. I need to have "external evidence" that the world really is dark, so that I "know" I'm not just deceiving myself. So the darkness must *manufacture* it.

This is what makes it so insidious. My cognition and perception are being manipulated—the very things I would use to detect the subterfuge in the first place. *Of course* my darkness wouldn't let me unveil it by thinking harder or more clearly about it—or else humanity would have solved this problem long ago.

Remember what it was like when you were feeling contempt? You weren't thinking "I'm feeling contempt." Your mind was filled with justifications for why this wasn't *real* darkness; or why, if it was, it was still necessary to defeat a greater evil.

But it was all a lie.

**While you're in limbo, you cannot detect that your thoughts are being manipulated in furtherance of a world you don't actually want. And most of us don't have a reliable way to check whether we're in limbo.** And it's a continuum, not binary.

Yet there's a part of us that *always knows whether we're in limbo, and what we are hiding.* Otherwise it wouldn't be limbo.

We have trained ourselves to forget that part of us—the one part that could actually bring an end to our darkness. We called it our "conscience" earlier, but that word barely scratches the surface. 

There is an aspect of your mind that never falls for your shenanigans, and it is always available. It's the part that feels most like "you." In your moments of deepest integrity, you don't have to justify anything to yourself; you just know. You know what you're in service to.

Numerous traditions have pointed to this part of us—but when described in its entirety, it begins to sound quasi-religious. And since our culture abhors religion, we have thrown out the baby with the bathwater.

Let that sit for a moment. Which part of us would have an incentive to keep this aspect of ourselves out of the cultural eye?

---

## Shielding

Most of us are naturally averse to harming others. If you feel into why, it's because you can see something of yourself in them. You know what it's like to hurt, and you don't really want that for others.

But the more the darkness takes ahold, the more your perception shifts. The less you can see yourself in them—again, not just at a conceptual level, but a perceptual one. This doesn't happen evenly across everyone you see. We naturally have an easier time feeling it for some people than others.

But the desire to cause harm *requires* this perceptual shielding, which is the natural result of the progressive darkening of the mind. This is why our enemies become easier to hate and harm.

And the more we shield ourselves to cause harm, the more harm we're causing, which requires even more shielding. Each layer makes the next easier.

It can become a runaway process with *astonishing* speed under the right (wrong) circumstances.

---

What would a person look like if they didn't stop this process in time? Someone fully unmoored from conscience; totally possessed by darkness, causing pain to others without compunction? Fully committed to their righteous ideologies instead of to the actual, living, breathing humans around them? Someone you couldn't reach with words, because their whole mind is hijacked?

We'd call them *evil,* of course.

And then we'd treat them with contempt.

---

And here's what we miss: even at that extreme, that original pain of harming others hasn't really disappeared. It never becomes less conscious, exactly—just better hidden. They're still turning away from the same recognition we are, just far more completely.

(If you dare to get a taste for this, try giving someone a dehumanizing glare. It's difficult, isn't it? Sends a shudder down the spine. What are they perceiving in you when you do this? What does it feel like from the inside? That's what shielding feels and looks like. And the shudder? That's your conscience—your alarm system warning you.)

What evil people do, and the contempt we feel for them—they're made of the same stuff, and are mutually reinforcing. We have as hard a time recognizing our mild version as they do their profound one.

This is also why malice and hiding aren't two separate requirements to achieve the hall-of-mirrors effect: malice is only possible when there is hiding.

---

## Integrity

This last bit deserves a bit of clarification, or else it might sound like we're saying "don't judge (or fight) evil people."

Think back to the integrity examples in the opening. Can you feel how they were designed to make things better, not worse—and how you *knew* that intent, through and through? Can you feel how this is possible, even if violence is unfortunately required?

THAT is what fights the darkness. And it never feels remotely dark itself. There's no satisfaction in having caused harm.

There's nothing wrong with judging people if judging simply means "wise discernment." Of *course* we must identify evil and fight it. But the moment it crosses over into contempt; into that felt sense of the person being *inherently* defective—ontologically different from you—it's the darkness creeping in the back door.

Similarly, contempt for beliefs and behaviors is a very different kind of thing than contempt for people, and isn't necessarily harmful—but it's easy to conflate the two.

Finally, notice how correcting someone with integrity and correcting them with contempt both feel "righteous" in the moment—and yet those two kinds of righteous don't feel at all the same, do they?

So there *is* a way to tell—it's just not easy to describe (or to perfect).

---

As you may have guessed, the extent to which our minds are colonized by "darkness" is not a binary thing; it lies on a continuum. And unless you are enlightened, it's not exactly zero. This means that our cognitive apparatus is essentially *always* hijacked to some degree. That is the real reason humanity is on the brink.

If you are able to think of *anyone* toward whom you can feel even the slightest trace of malice, contempt, or self-righteousness... I'm sorry to say, that **is** the darkness operating in you. If you were face to face with them now, it would be very hard to avoid letting it leak out, thereby strengthening theirs. So it is operating in a latent fashion.

My perception of the world as a collection of fundamentally defective people I must valiantly overcome—that's actually a measure of how deeply I'm burying that fear about *myself*. And for that very reason, the deeper in I go, the less willing I am to even *countenance* this notion. That's what makes this thing so hard to defeat.

And even if you were somehow free of all of dark sentiments, there are still much subtler forms operating in your perception.

But we'll get to that later. For now, I want to show you why this matters so much.

## Hall of Mirrors (unpacked)

*(This section is dense and analytical. It's not necessary to understand, but may be interesting to analytical readers.)*

Let's unpack the hall of mirrors recursion more carefully.

When I nastily judge you for being a bad person, part of me already knows it's a ruse—that I'm trying to make you dig in. But if I were fully aware of it, it would be too obvious and you'd fail to take the bait. But revealing that I'm trying, while hiding it from myself? Perfect.

It's difficult to convey the full genius of this ruse, but let me try. Imagine you're on the receiving end of this.

Remember: they want to cause harm and need it to look innocent. So they want you to *feel* their malice, but must keep it plausibly deniable. And for it to be *truly* deniable, they must hide it from themselves. And they need you to *see* they're hiding it, so that you know your accusations will bounce off. So they must reveal their **hiding** to you—but mustn't let themselves know that. Which means they must hide their own hiding...

If you trace the logic carefully, you'll see it results in a recursion of hiding-yet-revealing. The result is a kind of hall-of-mirrors effect that essentially conveys: "we both know what I'm really doing, but I know you can't accuse me of it without sounding crazy." And that **is** the malice.

It's not that the *first* step was them telegraphing you their malice. I only used that word to make it more clear. They were just conveying their *intention* to make you the bad guy, and the recursion took care of delivering on that intention.

This requires a careful choreographing of our "conscious" and limbo parts, so that they can maintain plausible deniability at each level, while also making sure you know what's really happening. And this dance is orchestrated by *both of our dark aspects in tandem*. 

It's not that we *consciously* know the game we're playing, in the usual sense of that word. But I can't stress enough that limbo is in fact conscious, just sometimes *extremely* well hidden. So we both knew it, and that the other knew it, etc. And that's what makes it work.

Looked at another way: my darkness is revealing itself to yours, knowing it will provoke you into seeing me as evil, while hiding itself from me, so that I will take your resistance as proof that *you* are—thereby strengthening both of ours. It's a kind of secret handshake between our dark parts, enabled by common knowledge.

(This description of the effect requires both malice and the hiding of malice—but as we'll soon see, they aren't actually two things. I *can't* feel malice without hiding something from myself. And actually, the initial seed isn't even malice, but something we'll explore later, that makes it all fit together even more satisfyingly.)
