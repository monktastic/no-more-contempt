# Part 1: Limbo!

Have you ever accused someone of being a _bad person_—not just that they were acting bad, but like *badness* was somehow inherent to their being? Maybe you said it out loud, or maybe you just made sure they felt it. But instead of owning up to it, they dug in their heels, right? Why, exactly? It probably felt obvious at the time: because they're *bad.*

But when you're on the receiving end of contempt—even if you know you've done wrong—you don't thank them for it, do you? No matter what they say or how "right" they may be, you can tell they're not coming from a good place. How?

How can contempt feel so righteous from the inside, yet so dark, dirty, manipulative from the outside?

---

Isn't there a part of us that would benefit from knowing that our enemies are as bad as we feared—like it helps the world make sense?

Might that part be subtly influencing our behavior in ways that encourage them to *stay* bad, or even become *worse*? It would give us a bit more leeway in dealing with them. *Loosen the shackles*, so to speak...

But that would be uncomfortable to face, so we’d resist really seeing it. And that very resistance would *also* benefit it, by preventing us from looking too closely at whether we really want it.

---

What would all this look like from the outside? If someone were secretly trying to keep you trapped in your "badness," and burying this knowledge so deep that even *they* barely knew it—while feeling righteous on the surface?

That combination would feel dark, dirty, insincere.

It would look like *contempt*.

---

So there's a part of us that can influence our behavior enough to ensure others notice, while perfectly hiding itself from us? This is already deeply strange.

And yet, looking back on when you received contempt, can’t you sense both halves? That some part of them needed you to stay bad, while their conscious intention felt righteous? 

If they were aware of that first half—let alone the devious combination—they'd have a hard time hiding it so well, wouldn't they? How could everyone doing this be such perfect actors?

But it gets stranger.

## Conscience

Have you ever done something you knew was wrong at the time, but couldn't fully admit that to yourself until later? Maybe you said something cruel to boost your own ego, or took credit for someone else's work, or cheated on a test.

While you were doing it, wasn't your mind creating justifications for why it wasn't *really* wrong?

Notice an asymmetry here: the part that knew it was wrong—your conscience—wasn't trying to justify itself. It just... *was*. And the justifications weren't there to convince *it*; they were there to convince *you*—that it was just one more voice among the chaos, equal with all the others.

But it wasn't.

We *know* we can't win in a direct confrontation with our conscience. Nor can we silence it. All we can do is ignore it better. So that's what you did—and yet some part of you sensed that this wouldn't end well, didn't it? That this deception would come back to bite you, even if nobody else ever knew?

Both halves—the undeniable wrongness and the conviction it was okay—were conscious. You might have convinced yourself you didn't know, right up until you were able to admit it—at which point you saw that you _had_ known all along, but had hidden it from yourself.

---

## Limbo

In this way, knowledge can exist in a kind of "limbo state": a bizarre schism of mind in which we know something—*consciously*—and yet are sure we don't. It is only later we discover that we always did.

This state shows up in various forms and intensities, but it has a certain signature that's hard to miss the more we notice it.

At the same time, the part of us that's getting something from all this doesn't *want* us to notice it. In fact, it wouldn't even want us *thinking* about this whole thing. It would rather we just feel guilt and shame, so that we would never bother to ask: what even *is* this thing?

Well, what is it?

---

When I do wrong and justify it to myself, and when I feel contempt for my enemies—notice how the same mechanism is at play. You already knew contempt made your enemies worse, but that knowledge might have been in limbo.

When we stop and reflect, it's obvious we don't want our enemies to become worse. Not only will they fight *us* harder, they'll spread that toxicity to others. This darkens the world as a whole.

And in the example you picked about doing wrong—wasn't it hard to admit because you knew you had benefited yourself at the world's expense? Maybe part of you even recognized: "I've just given permission for *others* to act selfishly, too." Again: darker world.

Isn't that in direct conflict with your conscious values?

Let me highlight one more aspect of this thing.

Have you ever had a moment of blind rage, where you'd be willing to let the whole world burn to satisfy it? Looking back now, doesn't it feel like something else has taken control of the wheel? Like "whoa, that wasn't *me*?"

Same thing, different form.

So here we have something that doesn't feel like "me," until it takes control. At which point it pretends to be me, works against my values, and makes me feel justified or even righteous. Then it covers itself up with guilt and shame, so that I never recognize what really happened.

---

The person you treated with contempt—consider how things looked from their perspective:

>*Oh, so you're a "good person"? I can literally **see** the darkness in you—that contemptuous part you're not admitting to yourself. You're just another hypocrite who thinks they're special. Why should I listen to my conscience when you won't listen to yours? Fuck that.*

They'll now find it easier to justify their self-serving behaviors, and harder to recognize them as such.

In fact, this is why we disobey our conscience in the first place: to protect ourselves from what we perceive as a dangerous or uncaring world—exactly the kind of world we just created for them. 

But because we don't recognize our role in causing this, we interpret their behavior as recalcitrance—resisting our goodness. On top of that, they're implicitly accusing *us* of being evil. They are well and truly defective!

So now *our* world seems darker, justifying... you guessed it, more self-deception. The shackles have been loosened.

---

The part of us that overrides our conscience to shittify the world, and the part of them that does the same—notice how they both benefited from this. We've given the dark aspects of ourselves *more* authorization to take control of our minds—to fight the bad guys, of course—while also making it harder to detect this.

Both of us then spread this infection to others—strengthening this same part in them, and rippling outward.

These parts of us aren't working *against* each other: they're *collaborating* while making us feel like we're fighting.

## Hall of Mirrors

*(This section is dense and analytical. Feel free to skip it, but it's worth trying to follow along.)*

Here's what makes the whole thing so crazy.

Every one of us knows this is how contempt works. It's just that most of us keep it hidden in limbo. In fact, everyone knows that everyone knows that everyone knows, *ad infinitum*—i.e., what game theorists call *common knowledge.* (The reason why will become clear later, but you can also intuit it yourself. Once the magic trick is revealed, you *see* why it requires both parties having common knowledge. For now I will just describe it.)

When I treat you with contempt, part of me already knows it's a ruse—that I'm trying to make you dig in. Of course, simply trying isn't enough to actually make it happen. But revealing that I'm trying-while-hiding-it-from-myself? That's genuinely maddening, and might work.

So that's what I do—and I know you know this, and *you* know I know you know, etc. This creates a hall-of-mirrors effect that's genuinely maddening. It's as if I'm communicating "we both know what I'm really doing, but I know you can't accuse me of it without looking stupid."

And that is how simply trying to make you dig in actually makes it happen. It requires a careful choreographing of our "conscious" and limbo parts, so that I can maintain plausible deniability at each level, while also making sure you know what's really happening. And this dance is orchestrated by both of our dark aspects in tandem.

If I were to stop at any level, my dark part wouldn't get what it wants. But since each level makes it harder for me to back out without losing face, I don't.

Looked at another way: my darkness is revealing itself to yours, knowing it will provoke you into seeing me as evil, while hiding itself from me, so that I will take your resistance as proof that *you* are—thereby strengthening both of ours. It's a kind of secret handshake between our dark parts, enabled by the common knowledge.

(This description of the effect requires both malice and the hiding of malice—but as we'll soon see, they aren't actually two things. I *can't* feel malice without hiding something from myself. And actually, the initial seed isn't even malice, but something we'll explore later, that makes it all fit together even more satisfyingly.)

---

When I say my world becomes darker as a result, I don't mean it in some abstract sense. After this encounter, I don't just *think* you're bad, I now *see* it; *feel* it more clearly than before. I then subtly override more of my morals to ensure you don't win—but it feels like a righteous necessity.

This isn't a separate mechanism from the one that deepens my capacity for self-deception, but the core mechanism behind it. I need to have "external evidence" that the world really is dark, so that I "know" I'm not just deceiving myself. So the darkness *manufactures* it.

This is what makes it so insidious. My cognition and perception are being manipulated—the very things I would use to detect subterfuge in the first place. *Of course* my darkness wouldn't let me just discover it by thinking harder or more clearly about it.

Why isn't that already obvious?

Oh. Right.

Remember what it was like when you were feeling contempt? You weren't thinking "I'm feeling contempt." Your mind was filled with justifications for why this wasn't *real* darkness; or why, if it was, that it was still okay because you were using it to defeat a greater evil.

While you're in limbo, you cannot detect that your thoughts are being manipulated—at least, not with your thinking mind.

But a small part of you knows it.

We called it your "conscience" earlier, but that word only scratches the surface. It's too early to give a full picture here, but for now just recognize how the more you feel in integrity, the less you have to justify yourself.



---

Most of us are naturally averse to harming others. If you feel into why, it's because you can see something of yourself in them. You know what it's like to hurt, and you don't really want that for others.

But the more the darkness takes ahold, the more your perception shifts. The less you can see yourself in them—again, not just at a conceptual level, but a perceptual one. This doesn't happen evenly across everyone you see. We naturally have an easier time feeling it for some people than others.

But the desire to cause harm *requires* this perceptual shielding, which is the natural result of the progressive darkening of the mind. This is why our enemies become easier to hate and harm.

And the more we shield ourselves to cause harm, the more harm we're causing, which requires even more shielding. Each layer makes the next easier.

It can become a runaway process with *astonishing* speed under the right (wrong) circumstances.

---

What would a person look like if they didn't stop this process in time? Someone unmoored from their conscience; totally possessed by darkness, causing pain to others without compunction? Fully committed to their righteous ideologies instead of to the actual, living, breathing humans around them? Someone you couldn't reach with words, because their whole mind is hijacked?

We'd call them *evil,* of course.

And then we'd treat them with contempt.

---

And here's what we miss: even at that extreme, that original pain of harming others hasn't really disappeared. It never becomes less conscious, exactly—just better hidden. They're still turning away from the same recognition we are, just far more completely.

What evil people do, and the contempt we feel for them—they're made of the same stuff, and are mutually reinforcing. We have as hard a time recognizing our mild version as they do their profound one.

This is also why malice and hiding aren't two separate requirements to achieve the hall-of-mirrors effect: malice is only possible when there is hiding.

---

This last bit deserves a bit of clarification before we move on, or else it might sound like we're saying "don't judge (or fight) evil people."

Can you remember a time when someone corrected you *without* contempt, but with full integrity; seemingly getting nothing out of it themselves? Even if it stung your ego; even if it made you lose face, you had no desire to take revenge, did you? It almost felt like an externalized version of your own conscience—you _knew_ you couldn't win against it. More than that: you didn't want to.

What were they serving in that moment? How could you tell?

How about a time when you corrected someone with integrity yourself? Even if you had to do it with ferocity, or even violence—something in you knew it would ultimately bring more peace to the world than just being *nice*. How did you know?

Whatever you were serving in your moment of integrity, and what the person who set you straight was serving: even if you knew nothing about them—their politics, their religion, their creed—did it *feel* like you were serving the same thing? What is that?

There *is* something that fights the darkness—and it's not more darkness.

There's nothing wrong with judging people if judging simply means "wise discernment." Of *course* we must identify evil and fight it. But the moment it crosses over into contempt; into that felt sense of the person being *inherently* defective—ontologically different from you—it's the darkness creeping in the back door.

Similarly, contempt for beliefs and behaviors is a very different kind of thing than contempt for people, and isn't necessarily harmful—but it's easy to conflate the two.

Finally, notice how correcting someone with integrity and correcting them with contempt both feel "righteous" in the moment—and yet those two kinds of righteous don't feel at all the same, do they?

So there *is* a way to tell—it's just not easy to describe (or to perfect).

---

As you may have guessed, the extent to which our minds are colonized by "darkness" is not a binary thing; it lies on a continuum. And unless you are enlightened, it's not exactly zero. This means that our cognitive apparatus is essentially *always* hijacked to some degree.

If you are able to think of *anyone* toward whom you can feel even the slightest trace of malice, contempt, or self-righteousness... I'm sorry to say, it is partially in control. That **is** the darkness operating in you. If you were face to face with them now, it would be very hard to avoid letting it leak out, thereby strengthening theirs.

And even if you were somehow free of all of those, there are still much subtler forms operating in your perception.

But we'll get to that later. For now, I want to show you why this matters so much.
