Have you ever seen someone as a _bad person_—like the badness was somehow essential to who they were? Maybe you said it out loud, or maybe you just let it show. But instead of admitting it, they dug in their heels, right? Why, exactly? It probably felt obvious at the time: because they're *bad.*

When you're on the receiving end of contempt—even if you know you've done wrong—you don't thank them for it. You can tell they're not coming from a good place. But how?

How can contempt feel so righteous from the inside, yet so dark, dirty, insincere from the outside?

---

Can you feel how there's a part of us that *benefits* from our enemies being bad—like it helps the world make sense?

Might this part of us subtly influence our behavior in ways that encourage them to *stay* bad, or become *worse*? That would be uncomfortable to admit, so we’d resist really seeing it.

And that very resistance would *also* benefit this part of us. It would prevent us from looking too closely at it, to decide for ourselves whether we really wanted it.

---

What would this look like from the outside? If someone were secretly trying to keep you trapped in your "badness," and burying this knowledge so deep that even *they* barely knew it—while feeling righteous on the surface?

That combination would feel dark, dirty, insincere.

---

This is already deeply strange. There's a part of us that can somehow *make itself known* to others while hiding itself from us?

And yet, looking back, can’t you sense both halves on the receiving end? That some part of them needed you to stay bad, while their conscious intention felt righteous? 

If they were aware of that first half—let alone the devious combo—they'd have a hard time hiding it so well, wouldn't they? How could everyone doing this be such perfect actors?

But it gets stranger.

---

Have you ever done something you knew was wrong at the time, but couldn't fully admit that to yourself until later? Maybe you said something cruel to boost your own ego, or took credit for someone else's work, or cheated on a test.

While you were doing it, wasn't your mind creating justifications for why it wasn't *really* wrong?

Notice an asymmetry here: the part that knew it was wrong—your conscience—wasn't trying to justify itself. It just... *was*. And the justifications weren't there to convince *it*; they were there to convince *you*—that it was just one more voice among the noise, equal with all the others.

But it wasn't.

We *know* we can't win in a direct confrontation with it. Nor can we silence it. All we can do it ignore it better. So that's what you did—and yet some part of you sensed that this wouldn't end well, didn't it? That this deception would come back to bite you, even if nobody else ever knew?

It can *feel* like this knowledge is unconscious, but that's not quite right. Both halves—the wrongness and the conviction it was okay—existed together in your conscious mind. It's just that you were turned slightly away from one of them.

---

In this way, knowledge of our wrongdoing can exist in a kind of "limbo state"—a bizarre schism of mind in which we both *know* and yet *don't*. In fact, it _must_ exist that way—or else we couldn't go through with it.

This state shows up in various forms and intensities, but it has a certain signature that's hard to miss the more we notice it.

At the same time, the part of us that's getting something from it doesn't *want* us to notice it. In fact, it wouldn't even want us *thinking* about this whole thing. It would rather we just feel guilt and shame, so that we would never bother to ask: what even *is* this thing?

Well, what is it?

---

Notice: it's the same thing in both cases. When I did wrong and justified it to myself, and when I feel contempt for my enemies—it's the same mechanism.

When we stop and reflect, it's obvious we don't want our enemies to become more entrenched. Not only will they fight *us* harder, they'll spread that toxicity to others. The world as a whole gets darker.

And in the example you picked about doing wrong—wasn't it hard to admit because you knew you had benefited yourself at the world's expense? Maybe part of you even recognized: "I've just given permission for *others* to act selfishly, too." Again: a darker world.

Isn't that in direct conflict with your conscious values?

Let me highlight one more place where this thing shows up. 

Have you ever had a moment of blind rage, where you'd let the whole world burn to satisfy it? Looking back at it, doesn't it feel like something else has taken control of the wheel? Like "whoa, that wasn't *me*?"

Same thing, different form.

So here we have something that doesn't feel like "me," until it takes control. At which point it pretends to be me, works against my values, and makes me feel justified or even righteous. Then it covers itself up with guilt and shame, so that I never recognize what really happened.

I feel like we should all be talking about this.

But there's a reason we don't.

---

The person you treated with contempt—consider how things looked from their perspective:

>*Oh, so you're a "good person"? I can literally **see** the darkness in you—that contemptuous part you're not admitting to yourself. You're just another hypocrite who thinks they're special. Why should I listen to my conscience when you won't listen to yours? Fuck that.*

They'll now find it easier to justify their self-serving behaviors, and harder to recognize them as such.

In fact, this is why we disobey our conscience in the first place: to protect ourselves from a dangerous or uncaring world—the kind of world we just created for them. 

But because we don't recognize our role in darkening their mind, we interpret their behavior as recalcitrance—resisting our goodness. We were right: they are well and truly *defective*.

This makes *our* world darker, justifying... you guessed it, more self-deception of our own.

---

The part of us that overrides our conscience to shittify the world, and the part of them that does the same—they both benefited from this. We've given them *more* authorization to take control—to fight the bad guys, of course—while also making it harder to detect what they're really doing.

Both of us then spread this infection to others—strengthening this same part in them.

These things aren't working *against* each other: they're *collaborating* while making us feel like we're fighting.

## The Hall of Mirrors

Now we can peel back the layers to see how it works in an individual interaction.

The dark part of me: when I treat you with contempt, *that's* what you're seeing. And it *wants* you to see this, because it knows it will provoke you into seeing me as evil.

At the same time, it's hiding itself from me, so that I'll take your resistance as proof that *you* are.

But it's not unconscious. Part of me knows I'm doing this, and that knowledge is unbearable, so I'm forced to hide it harder. But now you sense not just malice, but hypocrisy. And I sense the truth in that too, forcing me to hide it *harder*. And then you sense *that*...

It's not just the initial seed of malice you're seeing in me, but this whole recursive hall-of-mirrors effect, that makes it so maddening. 

(As stated here, this hall of mirrors effect requires both malice and the hiding of malice—but as we'll soon see, they aren't actually two things. In fact, the very first seed isn't even malice, but something we'll explore later too, that makes it all fit together even more satisfyingly.)

---

When I say my world becomes darker as a result, I don't mean it in some abstract sense. After this encounter, I don't just *think* you're bad, I now *see* it; *feel* it more clearly than before.

This isn't a separate mechanism from the one that deepens my tendency for self-deception, but the core mechanism behind it. I need to have "external evidence" that the world really is dark, so that I "know" I'm not just deceiving myself, and that my behavior is warranted. Hence the darkness *manufactures* it.

This is what makes it so insidious. My cognition and perception are being manipulated—and they're the very things I would use to detect the subterfuge in the first place. *Of course* my darkness won't let me just discover it by thinking more clearly about it. 

Why isn't that already obvious?

Oh. Right.

Remember what it was like when you were feeling contempt? You weren't thinking "I'm feeling contempt." Your mind was filled with justifications for why this wasn't *real* darkness; or why, if it was, that it was still okay because you were using it for a good cause.

While you're in it, you cannot detect it—at least, not with your thinking mind.

And yet, just like in the "doing wrong" case, a small part of you knew it. So there *is* a faculty you have to detect it.

We called it your "conscience" earlier, but that word only scratches the surface. What you were both in service to while in integrity—it transcends cultural differences. It's too early to give a full picture here, but just notice that there's an aspect of your mind that can't be fooled by justifications—only ignored.

But that still doesn't answer why you can't see it all clearly now, during a time of seeming calm. For that, we need to unpack a bit more.

---

Most of us are naturally averse to harming others. If you feel into why, it's because you can see something of yourself in them. You know what it's like to hurt, and you don't really want that for others.

But the more the darkness takes a hold, the more your perception shifts. The less you can see yourself in them—again, not just at a conceptual level, but a perceptual one. This doesn't have to happen evenly across everyone you see. You can certainly have an easier time feeling for some people than others.

But the desire to cause harm requires this perceptual shielding, which is the natural result of the progressive darkening of the mind.

And the more we shield ourselves to cause harm, the more harm we're causing, which requires even more shielding. Each layer makes the next easier.

It can become a runaway process with *astonishing* speed under the right (wrong) circumstances.

---

What would a person look like if they didn't stop this process in time? Someone continually possessed by darkness, causing pain to others without compunction? Fully committed to their righteous ideologies instead of to the actual, living, breathing humans around them?

We'd call them *evil.*

And then we'd treat them with contempt.

---

Here's what we miss: even at that extreme, that original pain of harming others hasn't disappeared. It never becomes less conscious, exactly—just better hidden. They're still turning away from the same recognition we are, just far more completely.

What evil people do, and the contempt I feel for them—they're made of the same stuff, and are mutually reinforcing.

This is why malice and hiding aren't two separate requirements to achieve the hall-of-mirrors effect we see in the eyes of someone feeling contempt or in someone evil: malice already *entails* hiding.

---

This deserves a bit of clarification before we move on.

Can you remember a time when someone corrected you *without* contempt, but with full integrity; seemingly getting nothing out of it themselves? Even if it stung your ego; even if it made you lose face, you had no desire to take revenge, did you? It almost felt like an externalized version of your own conscience—and you _knew_ you couldn't win against it. More than that: you didn't want to.

What were they serving in that moment? How could you tell?

How about a time when you corrected someone with integrity yourself? Even if you had to do it with ferocity, or even violence—something in you knew it would ultimately bring more peace to the world than if you were simply polite. How did you know?

Whatever you were serving in your moment of integrity, and what the person who set you straight was serving: even if you knew nothing about them—their politics, their religion, their creed—did it *feel* like you were serving the same thing? What is that?

There *is* something that fights the darkness—and it's not more darkness.

There's nothing wrong with judging people if judging simply means "wise discernment." Of *course* we must identify evil and fight it. But the moment it crosses over into contempt; into that felt sense of the person being *inherently* defective—ontologically different from you—it's the darkness creeping in the back door.

Notice how correcting someone with integrity and correcting them with contempt both feel "righteous" in the moment—and yet those two kinds of righteous don't feel at all the same, do they? That's the clue—and also the distinction that the darkness wants you to miss.

---

So: why can't we see completely clearly now, given that we're seemingly free of the darkness?

As you may have guessed, it's not a binary thing; it lies on a continuum. And unless you are enlightened, it's not perfectly at zero.

If you are able to think of *anyone* toward whom you can feel even the slightest trace of malice, contempt, or self-righteousness... I'm sorry to say, it is partially in control. That **is** the darkness operating in you. If you were face to face with them now, it would be very hard to avoid letting it leak out, thereby strengthening theirs.

## The Light

All this setup helps us answer an interesting question: what might it be like to be *completely* free of darkness?

The part of you that lies beneath it all—let's call that your light.

We know that the less your own shielding, the more clearly you see that others only cause harm because of this bizarre deception mechanism we all share, and the less they appear *inherently* defective. The more contempt dissolves, and the harder a time you have wishing (malicious) harm on them—though you can certainly use force to stop them.

So you increasingly see the part of *them* that doesn't want to cause harm—*their* light—and you notice that you could *always* see it, but were somehow hiding it from yourself. 

This is what you're seeing when you "see something of yourself" in others. It's also the part that both you and that stranger were serving in yourselves—yet which you seem to share. It's the thing that dispels the darkness. Their correction *removed* some of your need to self-deceive, didn't it?

To summarize: the more your own light is uncovered, the more you see it in everyone else.

---

Now remember, we said that the shielding in even "evil people" doesn't *remove* their capacity to see the light in others—it just hides it so completely that they *don't know* they're seeing it.

But here's what that means: when you see someone's light—when you recognize that part of them beneath all their self-deception—*on some level, they can sense that you're seeing it*.

Think back to that person who corrected you with integrity. Didn't you immediately sense what they were seeing in you? Not what they thought about you, but what they were *serving* in you—that part of you that knew better?

And couldn't they tell that you recognized this? That's why the interaction felt so clean. Their light "speaking" directly to yours, no bullshit in between.

This recognition goes both ways, always. When I see your light, you sense it—and I sense that you sense it. Neither of us has to say anything. It's just... *known*.

---

Now notice what this means.

When I see your light, I'm seeing *with* my own light. And light recognizes light—in the same way that when two people make eye contact, each can see that the other sees them, and each can see that the other sees that they see them, and so on.

It's not built up through reasoning. It's immediate and automatic.

So if my light sees your light, then my light knows that your light sees my light. And your light knows that my light knows this. And my light knows that your light knows that my light knows. And so on, infinitely.

This is what game theorists call "common knowledge": I know that you know that I know... *ad infinitum*.

---

This mutual recognition is always present. The shielding doesn't prevent it—it just prevents us from *consciously acknowledging* it.

So when I pretend to be inherently superior to you—when I shield myself from seeing your light fully—you *already know* I'm lying. Not because you caught me in some logical contradiction, but because your light can directly sense my light, even while I'm pretending it's not there.

And my light knows that your light knows. And your light knows that my light knows that your light knows. The same hall of mirrors effect as before—but now we can see where the recursion *starts*.

---

Outright malice evokes a stronger sense of this effect than contempt, which is stronger than subtle superiority—but they all convey the same basic message: *I'm shielding myself from seeing you fully.*

And you know it. And I know you know it. And that knowledge is unbearable—which is why I have to shield myself even harder.

The very first seed—before the malice, before the contempt, before even the first hint of superiority—is simply this: the turning away from that mutual recognition.

*That's* what my darkness is protecting. Not the bad thing I did, but the fact that I turned away from the light to do it.
