Have you ever been so angry that you'd be willing to let the whole world burn to satisfy your white-hot rage? In that moment, didn't your anger feel *righteous?*

Now think back to a moment of fierce integrity—where you did the right thing even at great cost to yourself. Didn't that feel righteous, too?

And yet these two kinds of "righteous" didn't feel the same at all, did they?

They both felt like "you" in the moment—but from this vantage point, which one feels more like the "real" you—if there even is such a thing?

Maybe try it this way. In your heart of hearts; your most authentic moments: do you long for a more beautiful world—or a more hellish one?

In that case, what was in control when that violent rage felt like "you"?

---

Let's bring it back to more everyday examples.

Think back to a moment you felt contemptuously judged by another person. No matter how "right" they may have been; even if you *knew* you had done wrong, something felt *off* about them, didn't it? There was *no way* you were going to give them the satisfaction. You could tell they weren't coming from a good place. How?

Now think of a time when someone set you straight with profound integrity, seemingly getting nothing out of it themselves. Even if it stung your ego; even if it made you lose face, you had no desire to take revenge, did you? What were they serving in that moment? How could you tell?

Now flip the tables.

Think of a time when *you* contemptuously judged someone. Maybe you tried to make it look polite on the surface. But they still dug in their heels, didn't they? Why do you suppose that was? Why did you *tell* yourself it was?

And finally, a time when you corrected someone with integrity yourself. Perhaps you had to do it with *more* ferocity; more violence than in the previous case—and yet something in you knew it would ultimately bring *more* peace to the world, didn't you? *How* did you know?

---

The part of you that was in control during contempt—can you sense a similarity with the moment of white-hot rage? Like they were different degrees of the same thing?

Do you think that part of you might have influenced your perception of *why* your target dug in their heels? Would it have an *incentive* to interpret in bad faith—as a way for it to maintain control?

---

Whatever you were serving in your moment of integrity, and what the person who set you straight was serving: even if you knew nothing about them—their politics, their religion, their creed—did it *feel* like you were serving the same thing? What is that?

And now, when you showed contempt, and when you were shown contempt: did *those* feel like they might be serving the same thing? Even if your politics or religion were polar opposites?

---

If our dark parts are serving the same thing; if they're not really "us" at all; if unleashing them on our enemies only strengthens theirs, which they then pass on to others...

If it's creating a world that the deepest part of us couldn't possibly want; that we could only *think* we want when it's in control...

Then whatever this thing is, we're not using it. *It's using us.*

By *convincing* us that we're using it. That we need it.

My darkness: it's not the *real* kind. It's there to protect me. 

The strategic kind. The kind that all *good people* must harbor to keep *real* evil in check.

That we must nurture. Feed. Defend with our lives.

---

If it can influence our perceptions, our interpretations—then the cleverest thing it could do is make us see it only in other people. Never in ourselves.

Then we would feel *morally obligated* to righteously unleash on them.

Huh, that's weird—the world keeps getting darker. It can only be *their fault.* 

There's only one way to stop them now: to hand over more control to the only part of us that can deal with such people. Our contempt. Our malice. Our *righteous fury*.

*Why isn't it working?*

---

Now think of a time you skirted your conscience. Maybe you kept extra change from a cashier error; said something cruel to boost your own ego; took credit for someone else's work.

What was going on in your mind at the time?

One part of you felt you were doing wrong, while in another part: justifications.

Notice the asymmetry: your conscience didn't try to justify itself. It just... was. And the justifications weren't there to convince *it*; they were there to convince *you*—that you couldn't hear it; that it was just another voice competing in the sea of options.

But it wasn't, was it?

We *know* we can't win in a direct confrontation with our conscience. All we can do is try to silence it, but it never actually gets quieter—we just learn to ignore it better.

Your Light: it doesn't talk. It just knows.

Your darkness: it has all the right answers.

If I were the Devil, I'd exploit this bizarre fact as hard as I could. I would tell your people:

*"How can something that doesn't speak have any answers? How could it lead you to what is Good and True? Pure superstition! There is no darkness; no light. There is only what you can prove; what you can calculate. Follow those, and those alone. They shall be your Light.*"

That is how I would usurp the throne.

---

Contempt feels honest and righteous from the inside and dark, dirty, insincere from the outside.

How does that work? *Let me share the devil's innermost secret.*

My darkness hides itself from me while telegraphing itself to you.

But it can never be perfectly hidden from me. Part of me sees it, but I pretend that I don't.

But you somehow sense that too—not just the darkness, but the *hiding.*

And somewhere deep down, I know this, too, so I must hide it harder...

But you see that, too...

Which I must then hide...

At each step: something hiding itself from me while telegraphing itself to you.

Why? Because *how else could it do its dirty deed?*

A hall of mirrors. Plausible deniability. Clean in here, sinister out there.

*That's* what you're seeing.

*That's* the devil.

---

Somewhere in me, I *know* I have darkened your mind. I pretend not to know this, because what would that make me?

And yet, even before I did it, didn't I know this would happen? Don't we *all* know this is how it works?

So when you saw me hiding my darkness, you already knew the game that was afoot—and you knew that *I* knew. And you didn't like that one bit.

And yet we each felt powerless to stop it.

My desire to hide my darkness makes it leak into you.

And part of me is okay with this—*wanted* this—because seeing "your" darkness helps me hide mine better.

Except that part of me now knows what I've done, and so I'm forced to hide it harder. In you.

This hidden knowledge collapses in on itself, like a black hole.

No knowledge of this dark intent can then escape my mind. 

I am righteously *battling* the evil out there. How *dare* anyone suggest I am creating it?

---

Nobody can prove that any of this is happening.

It sounds *utterly ridiculous*—and that is exactly what makes it work.

When I treat you with contempt; when I am darkening your mind: what would people *say* if you told them.

*"He.... he's... projecting his darkness onto me, knowing that nobody can prove it, which is why it works, but I'll look c..c...crazy if I say it! Surely someone else sees this!"*

Yeah. Right, buddy. Off with you to the funny house.

And yet, deep down, we all know this is how it works. We can prove it in our own experience, but somehow not objectively.

The Devil's unprovability is a feature. Not a bug.

---

The further I drift from my own Light, the harder a time I have seeing it in others. The less I give them the benefit of the doubt.

But it never *feels* like my perception is being manipulated. It just feels like... the truth. It feels like I'm seeing more clearly than I ever have.

It doesn't just *feel* like the truth. All my thoughts, ideologies, reasoning... they're able to prove me correct.

It has control over vast swathes of my *entire cognitive apparatus*, subverting my attempts to detect it.

This is why it's so hard to rescue people from the dark. They literally cannot see that they're trapped in it.

And what's more: their darkness powerfully resonates with my own. I feel the urge to *punish them.*

And it feels *so. fucking. righteous.*

---

When you feel contempt, you don't just *feel* righteous—all your thoughts can *prove* that it is.

And yet, part of you knows you are darkening the world. This part of you is not unconscious. You are just turned away from it.

If one part of your conscious mind can be flawlessly convinced you're helping the world, while another part is busy darkening it—why do you think you can trust your thoughts about right and wrong?

Because *other thoughts* tell you that you can?

And yet, please do not misunderstand me.

When I am in direct contact with my Light—not my *false* Light; but my real one—everything is different.

I am free to calculate. To reason. To compute. I *know* what it is in service to—and it is not only myself. Sometimes it is not *even* myself.

Everything comes down to staying connected to my *actual* Light. The more I drift, the more my calculations of good and bad become fatally compromised—and the less I'm able to realize it.

The Light is not a feeling, and it is *definitely* not an idea. I do not know how to point you to it, except to say that you already know where to find it. And I trust you will help me when I forget too.

---

The Devil finds ways to keep the world mired in conflict. It generates a constant background hum of casual cruelty—the kind we see all over social media, and maybe contribute to ourselves—which then feeds back into itself.

That little edge of irritation when someone's being slow, that tiny flicker of superiority when I'm better at something, that little satisfaction of being right, of dismissing stupid opinions, ...

All feeding the Beast.

All so... completely normal.

---

It doesn't just spread through our enemies. It spreads through our *allies*—through the very causes we hold most dear.

You care about animals? Real. Contempt for non-vegans? Devil.

You care about the planet? Real. Ecoterrorism? Devil.

You care about justice? Real. Contempt for those who don't see it yet? Devil.

It finds what we love most and whispers: "This is so important. So *urgent*. How can you not have contempt for those who oppose it?"

And suddenly, we're no longer serving the cause. We're serving our contempt, using the cause as cover.

We bond with our allies over shared contempt for our enemies. It feels like solidarity. Like we're on the same team, fighting the same fight.

But contempt doesn't build movements. It builds mobs.

And the Devil spreads from mind to mind, using our genuine love for the cause as camouflage. We're inoculating each other—not against darkness, but *with* it.

The animals don't benefit when we darken minds. The planet doesn't benefit when we make environmentalism synonymous with self-righteousness. Justice doesn't benefit when we become the cruelty we oppose.

But *we* benefit. Our darkness feeds while wearing virtue's costume.

This is how the most dangerous darkness enters: through people genuinely trying to help, who have no idea they've been compromised.

Every movement. Every cause. Every religion. Every ideology that ever mattered.

The Devil doesn't destroy them from outside. It injects contempt into their advocates and lets them tear themselves apart from within—while thinking they're fighting for good.

---

It exploits absolutely every opportunity. Finds reasons for me to judge a little too harshly. Shave off a little extra because everyone does it—especially those greedy bastards. Absolve myself because corporations are the *real* problem.

And somehow... other people sense it. Just like they feel my contempt. I don't know how, but they do.

And it licenses them to hand over control, too. Why should *they* have to be the ones resisting it alone?

And then they pass it on.

---

This... *thing.* It wants us to believe that compassion is weak. That it means being nice, or gentle, or tolerant or understanding. It needs us to forget that the Light is *powerful beyond measure*—and that it's the *only* weapon we have.

That time you stood in fierce integrity—was it weak or was it powerful?

The person you corrected—do you think they moved toward their own Light or away from it?

Why did it work? What happened in that moment?

When you correct someone from your Light—without a trace of contempt—something in them *recognizes* it. Their darkness can't hide behind "you're just being self-righteous" because you're not. It can't say "you're just trying to feel superior" because you're not.

Your Light strips that away—not by argument, not by proof, but by simply *being what it is*: a complete lack of hiding.

In that moment, part of their darkness—their plausible deniability—evaporates.

That's not weakness. That's the only thing that's ever actually worked.

If you could find that part buried beneath the rubble in other minds—beneath all the pain, the confusion, the despair—and you could somehow remind them of it: would that be weak?

And if we know that these parts are somehow fighting in the *same direction*—the only direction that eradicates the infection...

Weak? Or powerful?

---

When I correct you with contempt: a secret handshake between our darknesses. Mine reminding yours that the Light is only a myth; that even the so-called "good people" are only frauds; that *darkness is the way*.

When I correct you with integrity: a secret handshake between the Light. Mine reminding yours that it has a partner in the fight against our primal nemesis.

*That* is what you are feeling when corrected with integrity. It almost feels like being confronted by your own conscience—just somehow externalized. You *know* you cannot win a fight against it—and more importantly, you don't want to. 

That is why there's no desire for revenge. They're only reminding you of who you really are—and that you, too, can hold the Light for others when they forget it themselves.

That's all compassion is: any action that doesn't feed the darkness. It can be fierce, or even violent if necessary—but it never contains even a *trace* of malice, contempt, or self-righteousness.

---

Judgement, outrage, anger—all have important purposes in this world. Judgement can mean wise discernment. Outrage can expose injustice. Anger can legitimately fight it. 

Mockery and shame—each can have its uses in the right context.

And yet all of them—*nearly always*—infected with subtle traces of contempt, or worse; turning them into weapons of the darkness.

Because nobody can tell from the outside which one we really meant.

And yet every one of us can tell.

---

Two actions can be made to look nearly identical from the outside—and yet if one is motivated by Light, and the other, darkness—I don't know how, but people can sense it.

THAT is the gap the Devil hides in.

The plausible deniability. The unprovability.

The "relax, it was just a joke."

The "Fuck around and find out."

"Shareholder value."

"Just giving customers what they want."

"Weapons of Mass Destruction."

All made of the same singular Lie.

That it's safe to turn away from my Light when no one's watching. That it's a private choice with no effect on the world.

"How could anyone else tell? I can barely tell myself!"

"No one will notice."

"It's different when *I* do it."

---

Part of me thinks I can get away with all my little deceptions. That they do not leak out into the world. That nobody will ever know.

But another part knows: I can't hide forever. It always comes out in the end.

Don't we already know this?

Then why do we act like we don't?

---

The darkness makes us feel *guilty.* *Ashamed.*

I know I'm harboring the darkness. I know there are times I let it win, and I still do it.

What kind of person does that make me?

And yet, that thought... it doesn't make me look *more* carefully at what's in control. It makes me afraid to look at all.

Very soon, I stop checking who's at the wheel.

Now I'm loud, proud, and in control of this thing. It's not using me—I'm using it.

And *that* is how it assumes full control.

---

It's not only the way mine keeps *me* away from my Light—it's also how mine keep you away from *yours*.

When I shame you—again, with *contempt*—I know I am making it harder for you to confront your own darkness.

---

Suppose our very deepest nature really is the Light. Then at our cores, we would share a profound commonality—no one better or worse than anyone else.

Have you ever felt that?

During moments of greater integrity; the closer you get to your Light—isn't it more obvious?

And what if you could turn that slider all the way up? To the place where no darkness remained in you? Then what would you see?

Now, if you'll allow me a bit of woo. I'm not asking you to believe it, and I'm *definitely* not trying to convince you. But check it against your experience and see if any part feels true.

Your Light, my Light—what if they're not just similar, but the *same* Light?

At the deepest level—beyond our rational minds—you are me and I am you.

And we would both know that—and that the other knows it, and that they know that, etc. That hall of mirrors again, this time at the most fundamental level.

Now consider what would happen if *contempt* somehow entered the picture.

I am only *pretending* to be superior, which you know is a lie, and I know you know, and you *know* I know you know, etc. Each level more maddening to you while being rejected by me, ad infinitum.

The recursive hypocrisy would be so psychologically intolerable that we'd have to _actively construct the perception of separateness_ just to make it bearable. 

You would just be you and I would just be me.

But now the seed of darkness—the one that I seeded—would be carried by you, and I would be forced to attack.

So we would do it again and again.

Until the very idea of unity seemed superstitious; tasteless. It would almost have to be banned—not by force, but by common, unspoken agreement. Because if it were true, what would it say about how we've been acting?

---

This is not something for you to believe or accept. It would be *worse than useless* if you did.

But there are methods for investigating it yourself.

They may have become ensconced in baggage that the modern mind cannot tolerate.

But it would be a real shame to throw the baby out with the bathwater.

Because beneath all that baggage, they would be protecting something precious: a technology for remembering our most powerful weapon against our nemesis.

---

The battle between Good and Evil is not symmetrical. The Light and the darkness are not evenly matched forces locked in eternal struggle.

The darkness only has power because we've forgotten what we are. It's a parasite that needs us to believe it's part of us—that we need it, that it's strategic, that good people must harbor it.

That is the lie.

And the only way to expose it is to uncover the Light in its entirety. Not as a concept. Not as a belief. But as direct experience.

When you see your Light fully—when you remember what you actually are—the darkness is revealed as the interloper it always was. The emperor has no clothes.

This is why it fights so hard to keep you from looking. This is why it makes you afraid of what you'll find. This is why it tells you the Light is just superstition, pre-rational nonsense, naive spirituality.

Because the moment you truly see it, it is the beginning of the end.

---

And yet that battle—it really exists. Just not in the way we think.

It's not a fight between the good guys and bad guys.

The *real* fight takes place in every moment. Every choice, every interaction.

Everything is an opportunity for the Devil to slip in through the cracks. The crevices. The places where "nobody will ever notice"—not even ourselves.

The more I remember to stand by my Light, the more a surprising thing happens: *those around me start to remember, too.*

And it's not my doing. I cannot take credit for it. The idea that I can take credit—that the Light is mine; or that I have special access to it—that is the Devil.

---

The very line between "good people" and "bad people"; those who deserve my compassion and those who deserve my contempt—it only serves one purpose.

Nobody could "deserve" contempt—to be sacrificed to humanity's nemesis. That's the great lie.

And nobody "deserves" compassion either, because compassion is never "for" an individual—it is always in service to the Whole.

That line is how the Devil keeps its foot in the door, biding its time until we hand it the reins.

---

In one sense, nobody could choose to harbor the parasite, if they could see it for what it truly was.

We can only choose false righteousness over the genuine kind when we can no longer remember what the real one is like—at which point it becomes easy. 

Just like how people can only choose junk food over real food when they've never been offered real food. Porn over intimacy. Outrage over peace. The false righteousness over the real.

---

And yet, *make no mistake*: some people have, indeed, chosen the darkness. Knowingly. Willingly.

They may be few and far between, but they do exist. It would be naive to pretend otherwise.

But those are the people I must be *most* cautious with—the ones most able to separate me from my Light without my having any idea I'm being separated.

The ones who BEG me to shove them deeper into the arms of our nemesis.

So: fuck 'em. I will not give them what they want—or rather, what they *think* they want.

Like a bizarre form of Stockholm Syndrome, they think they want their captor. They've been with it so long they can no longer remember what freedom felt like. They defend it. Serve it. Choose it.

Their Light may not be accessible today. Or tomorrow.

But I *will* find it.

And I *will* remind it.

The darkness: it **does not win**.

---

To pretend to see the Light in others: naive, dangerous.

To be genuinely unable to see it: malicious, dangerous.

The only path forward: to *actually* see it.

The only way to do that: to become closer to my own.

---

As long as the darkness lurks *anywhere* in my mind—in even the *subtlest* traces of contempt—it will seek ways to re-colonize it. It will be on the prowl for ways to inject itself into our world, which it will do without fail. And it will corrupt my computations of right and wrong, so that I will secretly be serving myself even as I'm sure I'm serving you.

I know these things are still happening in me.

And I do not want that any more. Not for me, not for you. Not for *us*.

So I commit myself to finding my way back. I've seen it once—more than once. That is why I know—not guess—that it is in you, too.

It is the part of you resonating with these words.

---
## Afterword

*I do not identify as a Christian (or even religious, exactly—though I'm happy to use the word God in place of the Light), but these comparisons are too good to pass up.*

> _And no wonder, for even Satan masquerades as an angel of light. So it is not strange that his ministers also masquerade as ministers of righteousness._ —2 Corinthians 11:14-16

> *The accuser of our brethren* —Rev 12:10

> *The father of lies* —John 8:44

*Diabolos*—to accuse; to unjustly criticize to hurt; to destroy; to separate.
