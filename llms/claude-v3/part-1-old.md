# Part I

Have you ever been so angry you’d let the whole world burn to satisfy your white-hot rage? In that moment, didn’t it feel _righteous_?

Now think of a time you acted with fierce integrity, even at great cost to yourself. That felt righteous, too.

Same word, totally different meaning.

Both felt like “you” at the time—but which feels more like the real you now? Deep down; in your most authentic moments, do you long for a more beautiful world—or a more hellish one?

In that case, what was in control when that violent rage felt like "you"?

---

Now imagine this in smaller moments.

Think back to a moment you felt contemptuously judged by another person. No matter how "right" they may have been; even if you *knew* you had done wrong, something felt *off* about them, didn't it? There was *no way* you were going to give them the satisfaction. You could tell they weren't coming from a good place. How?

Now think of a time when someone set you straight with profound integrity, seemingly getting nothing out of it themselves. Even if it stung your ego; even if it made you lose face, you had no desire to take revenge, did you? What were they serving in that moment? How could you tell?

Now flip the tables.

Think of a time when *you* contemptuously judged someone. Maybe you tried to make it look civil on the surface, but they still dug in their heels, didn't they? Was it just because they were bad?

And finally, a time when you corrected someone with integrity yourself. Perhaps you had to do it with more ferocity; more violence than in the previous case—and yet something in you knew it would ultimately bring *more* peace to the world, didn't you? *How* did you know?

There's a pattern in these experiences—something we can all recognize but might not have seen so clearly. Let's look at what's actually happening inside.

## The Limbo State

Have you ever done something you knew was wrong at the time, but couldn't fully admit that to yourself until later? Maybe you said something cruel to boost your own ego, or took credit for someone else's work, or cheated on a test.

While it was happening—the justifications you used to excuse it


Think back to a time you skirted your conscience. Maybe you kept extra change from a cashier error, or said something cruel to boost your own ego, or took credit for someone else's work.

One part of you knew it was wrong, but another part was overriding it with justifications.

Notice the asymmetry: your conscience wasn't trying to justify itself. It just... was. And the justifications weren't there to convince *it*—which never works—but to convince *you* that you couldn't hear it; that it was just another voice among the sea of chaos.

But it's not.

We literally *cannot* do wrong without turning away from it; pretending we can't hear it. Knowledge of our wrongdoing then exists in a kind of limbo state: a bizarre schism of mind in which we both know and yet do not. Crucially: it's not unconscious. It's conscious, but hidden.

It's a profound form of self-deception—but it doesn't make us bad. We all do it, as a kind of defense against a seemingly-uncaring world. In ourselves, we see it as a minor flaw; but when others do it, we often *do* see them as "bad people."

---

When I accuse you of being a bad person, I'm seeing you as *inherently* defective—as if you don't even have a conscience to override. And I want you to feel the sting of that—of knowing that you're everything that's wrong with the world.

The problem is, deep down I suspect you can only do wrong for the same reason I do.


So I'm in a version of the limbo state. My "deep" suspicion isn't unconscious; I'm just turned away from it unusually well.

*That* is the "off" feeling you're sensing when you're on the receiving end of contempt—that I'm hiding something from myself. And you instinctively know what that means—because the only time you do that is when you're disobeying your *own* conscience.

So you instantly dig in—which I read as defiance. But I’m acting from good intentions—to fight evil—so your resistance proves me right. You *are* defective!

The problem is, part of me senses I'm not being entirely honest. I know that in your shoes I would also dig in, no matter how "right" my accuser was. This is uncomfortable knowledge, so I turn away from it, too.

And now I'm in a *deeper* version of limbo—which you also somehow sense, and which I feel forced to defend...

This rapidly spirals out of control, each turn tightening the noose. What began as simple accusation transformed into something monstrous: now I don't just *suspect* you're everything wrong with the world; I *need* you to be. Otherwise, the whole structure collapses, exposing *me* as the very thing I'm accusing you of.

---

This doesn't just reinforce my beliefs about the world; it modifies my perception of it. I actually *see* you as defective. I *feel* it in you.

Something in me is _shaping what I perceive_, in line with a belief I need to hold to protect myself. The resistance I encountered in you primes me to see the same thing as defectiveness in others, too.

So that initial sense—*you're what's wrong with this world*—has been reinforced in me, also making me less likely to give *others* the benefit of the doubt.

At the same time, the suspicion of my own hypocrisy has strengthened—but I'm turned away from it even more, so I notice it less.

---

My perception of the world as a collection of fundamentally defective people I'm valiantly fighting—that's actually a measure of how deeply I'm burying that fear about *myself*.

And for that very reason, the deeper in I go, the less willing I am to even *countenance* this notion.

We *know* what such people look like from the outside: they're the *bad people.*

And what do we do when we encounter them? *We shove them deeper in.*

---

Notice how it all started: with the slight *suspicion* that you do wrong for a fundamentally different reason than I do. That's just a milder version of the same state—not a different thing.

As long as that basic template exists in me, I'm liable to engage in this dynamic with you, which will strengthen it in *both of us.* Because from your perspective, here's what it feels like:

>*Here's a self-proclaimed "good person" who's actually a profound hypocrite—and I can tell that he knows, but is refusing to admit it. This world is even shittier than I thought—so why should I be the only one listening to my conscience? That would make me a sucker.*

I'm not just spreading the judgement mechanism to you—I'm spreading the *limbo state itself.*

---

None of this knowledge is unconscious when I do it. It only _feels_ that way because I'm turned away from it—hard. And contained in that knowledge is the awareness that I’m spreading the limbo state to you—reinforcing the very pattern in the world I claim to be fighting.

While I was doing it, my behavior felt righteous; it felt like *me* doing it; and now that I can reflect on what was really happening, I see that it was actually leading to a world I hate.

*That* is the feeling of "it wasn't quite me."

It's almost as if something possesses me—a part of myself I couldn't truly want if I saw it clearly. So it hides itself by pretending to _be_ me. It feels like me while it’s happening—and when it’s in control, it finds ways to spread itself to others while keeping me in the dark.

That's what the limbo state *is*.

My conscience—the part that wants what's good and right—that's closer to what it feels like to really be me. The part layering on justifications—that's this part of myself trying to take control.

So when I give in to those justifications, I'm not just harming myself—I'm subtly propagating that dark pattern to others.

I know we've only established this for the contempt case so far—and in particular, only for *bad people.* But that example most directly captures the essence of the whole mechanism, which is why we unpacked it first.

---

It feels shameful to admit when we've been doing this.

This thing—it is protecting itself by using my own morality against me. I feel ashamed because I *don't* want to harm others. This makes it hard for me to look clearly at what I've been doing—which means I can't inspect it carefully enough to see how it took control.

I want to be clear about this "possession" language. 

If I treat it as an external entity, then that both absolves me of responsibility and gives me one more thing to feel contempt for—which is just another way for it to slip in the back door. This is the trap a lot of religion falls into: treating the Devil as something "out there" that I'm valiantly fighting against—never realizing that my own self-righteousness *is* it.

On the other hand, if I take it as completely me, then there will always be this layer of shame protecting it.

There's a middle way. It is certainly me—and it is *you*, when you fall into it—and yet there's another sense in which it's not.

It is this combination—holding my feet to the fire, while also pointing me past that part of myself to what is deeper—that empowers me to heal it in myself. That is the gift the medicine offered me. It is the gift I can offer others. And it is what I hope this book offers you.
