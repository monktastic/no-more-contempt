## The Light

All this setup helps us answer an interesting question: what might it be like to be *completely* free of darkness?

The part of you that lies beneath it all—let's call that your light.

We know that the less your own shielding, the more clearly you see that others only cause harm because of this bizarre deception mechanism we all share, and the less they appear *inherently* defective. The more contempt dissolves, and the harder a time you have wishing (malicious) harm on them—though you can certainly use force to stop them.

So you increasingly see the part of *them* that doesn't want to cause harm—*their* light—and you notice that you could *always* see it, but were somehow hiding it from yourself. 

This is what you're seeing when you "see something of yourself" in others. It's also the part that both you and that stranger were serving in yourselves—yet which you seem to share. It's the thing that dispels the darkness. Their correction *removed* some of your need to self-deceive, didn't it?

To summarize: the more your own light is uncovered, the more you see it in everyone else.

Now remember, we said that the shielding in even "evil people" doesn't *remove* their capacity to see the light in others—it just hides it so completely that they *don't know* they're seeing it.

But here's what that means: when you see someone's light—when you recognize that part of them beneath all their self-deception—*on some level, they can sense that you're seeing it*.

Think back to that person who corrected you with integrity. Didn't you immediately sense what they were seeing in you? Not what they thought about you, but what they were *serving* in you—that part of you that knew better?

And couldn't they tell that you recognized this? That's why the interaction felt so clean. Their light "speaking" directly to yours, no bullshit in between.

This recognition goes both ways, always. When I see your light, you sense it—and I sense that you sense it. Neither of us has to say anything. It's just... *known*.

---

Now notice what this means.

When I see your light, I'm seeing *with* my own light. And light recognizes light—in the same way that when two people make eye contact, each can see that the other sees them, and each can see that the other sees that they see them, and so on.

It's not built up through reasoning. It's immediate and automatic.

So if my light sees your light, then my light knows that your light sees my light. And your light knows that my light knows this. And my light knows that your light knows that my light knows. And so on, infinitely.

This is what game theorists call "common knowledge": I know that you know that I know... *ad infinitum*.

---

This mutual recognition is always present. The shielding doesn't prevent it—it just prevents us from *consciously acknowledging* it.

So when I pretend to be inherently superior to you—when I shield myself from seeing your light fully—you *already know* I'm lying. Not because you caught me in some logical contradiction, but because your light can directly sense my light, even while I'm pretending it's not there.

And my light knows that your light knows. And your light knows that my light knows that your light knows. The same hall of mirrors effect as before—but now we can see where the recursion *starts*.

---

Outright malice evokes a stronger sense of this effect than contempt, which is stronger than subtle superiority—but they all convey the same basic message: *I'm shielding myself from seeing you fully.*

And you know it. And I know you know it. And that knowledge is unbearable—which is why I have to shield myself even harder.

The very first seed—before the malice, before the contempt, before even the first hint of superiority—is simply this: the turning away from that mutual recognition.

*That's* what my darkness is protecting. Not the bad thing I did, but the fact that I turned away from the light to do it.
