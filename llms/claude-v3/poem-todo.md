Part of me is constantly sensing who it's "okay" to push how far. The "evil" line is where I realize I can go completely dark on them myself—without guilt.

We've made "evil people" humanity's collective dumping ground. 

When I unleash contempt on them, I'm delivering a message: "Sorry, someone has to be the fall guy here. And if I can trap you in the abyss, I will know that my darkness is safe."

"The parasite's job is to make us confuse the person with their darkness. This alone ensures we will strengthen it. Evil is the _result_ of shielding from the Light, not its cause. Even if we suspect evil people are just shielding, we still suspect it's because they _are_ evil. Beyond a certain point, it starts feeling like the cause."

The friends I trust the most—they are the ones who would gladly sacrifice me if that were genuinely in greatest service to Life. The ones who help me protect my darkness—they are my false friends.

This doesn't mean I will know what behavior is best for the world. It only means I will act with complete honesty and clean intention. I still need wisdom—which compassion must be paired with to be truly effective.

The life-denier, life-destroyer.

Factory farms brutalizing helpless creatures, putting their smiling faces on packaging.
Prisons dehumanizing inmates, guaranteeing recidivism.
Governments sending our young off to die, to line the pockets of the rich.
Corporations plundering nature for profit.

It's all made of the same stuff. Of that little smirk I gave you, telling myself it was nothing.

Hollywood pumping out endless revenge fantasy films.
Our belief that humans are fundamentally greedy and selfish.
That reality itself is a lifeless collection of "stuff" to be used as resources.

The life-denier, life-destroyer.
