Now, when you were treated with contempt: didn't it feel like part them wanted you to feel bad—quite independent of any good it might do?

But in their minds, they probably told themselves they were doing *good*, right?

In fact, it was this maddening combination—appearing righteous while being malicious—that made you dig in.

That's what the limbo state looks like from the outside.

---

To help make that clear, let me narrate my own internal experience. See if you recognize any of it.

When I accuse you of being a bad person, part of me *hopes* you'll feel bad. But that's kind of malicious, so I tell myself it's for your own good, or the world's, or something. It then feels like I don't know about my own malice—but it's not unconscious. It's there; I'm just not looking at it.

For your part, you can see this schism. And I've been on the receiving end of it myself, so I *know* you can see it. But if I admitted that, you'd win, so I now hide that knowledge, too. But you now sense *this*, which I have to hide...

---

You're not just sensing that initial seed of malice: you're now in a hall-of-mirrors effect where *every layer* is malicious-but-hidden. It's the malice of the *entire pattern* you're sensing—and *that's* what makes you feel bad. 

Open malice doesn't create this maddening effect: it feels more like "whoa, that guy's evil—and everyone can see it." This is more like a shared secret. You and I know what's going on—and others might too, but they're not *feeling* it the way we are.

It's cruelly elegant: the *way* I made you feel bad was by *simply intending* to make you feel bad while *hiding* it from you—knowing full well that this combination would be enough to cause it.

Because this was all in limbo, none of it was actually unconscious. It was all perfectly accessible to my conscious mind—I was just turned away from it. It's not that I was conscious of every layer, obviously—but the whole gestalt; the pattern.

The reason I treat people with contempt is that I *know* they will detect my malice, making them see me as slightly evil—which I will use as proof that *they* are, because how dare they? And I *know* this will make them lose a bit of faith in humanity; make their world a little bit darker—but now I'm in too deep. I am *so fucking sorry*, but also... nobody in their right mind would accuse me of doing such a thing, so I'm not going to stop.

It's painful to write this, but it's the truth. I use the word "I" advisedly. I would like to pawn it off on some unconscious part of my brain, but I would be lying to you. It means I am *knowingly* darkening their minds. Not the "I" that sits here now—the I that takes the seat in such moments.

---

Here's the unfortunate thing. I only wanted to make you feel bad because I felt you *were* bad. I really did think I was fighting evil—and that's a benevolent intent. And yet look what it caused. Pain. Confusion. The very things I thought I was fighting.

Which you'll pass on to others—meaning I'll have to deny my role in it even harder. I'm stuck.

---

I mean that. I'm stuck in this as much as you are. My only hope is that if we can name this thing better as a society, we have a better chance of defeating it.

The Devil lurks in the shadows.

Naming him removes some of his cover.

What you saw in the person treating you with contempt was the limbo state.

They were *hiding something* from themselves. In contrast, the person treating you with integrity wasn't. Can you feel that?

Contempt feels honest and righteous from the inside, but dark, dirty, insincere from the outside.

Any time you're in limbo, you're telegraphing it through subtle tells that other people can pick up on—if only subconsciously—and it licenses them to do the same.

Now remember that the part of me in control during contempt *wants* me to interpret your response in bad faith. So it has every incentive to make me feel righteous on the inside while telegraphing my self-deception to you—which I know you'll pick up on, driving you into the limbo state. I then take that as proof that you are fundamentally defective.








---

The part of you that was in control during your contempt—can you sense a similarity with the moment of white-hot rage? Like they were variations of the same thing?

Might that part of you have biased your interpretation of *why* your target dug in their heels? Would it have an *incentive* to interpret in bad faith?

---

Whatever you were serving in your moment of integrity, and what that person who set you straight was serving: even if you knew nothing about them—their politics, their religion, their creed—did it feel like you were serving the *same* thing? What is that?

And now, when you showed contempt, and when you were shown contempt: did *those* feel like they might be serving the same thing? Even if your politics or religion were polar opposites?

---

So there's a part of us that doesn't really feel like us, until it takes control—at which point it works against our interests, while making us feel righteous about it.

That seems like an important thing to get to the bottom of. Let's look at how it works.

---


## The Signal

Think back to a time you accused someone of being a *bad person*—and really meant it. You probably told yourself you were doing it to help—if not them, exactly, then at least the world. But if you're honest, part of you just wanted them to feel bad, *quite independent of any good it would do*.

They probably dug in their heels, feeling *more* licensed in their self-deception—which further convinced us of their inherent badness. After all, we were only trying to help.






Even if we try to hide the malicious aspect, our target can sense it through our subtle tells. This darkens their mind, making them feel *more* licensed in their self-deception—which we take as evidence of inherent badness. *Strike one.*

What we see is a person who became defensive in response to our righteous behavior, instead of introspecting and thanking us for our wisdom. They're implicitly accusing _us_ of being evil. _Strike two._

But part of us knows we're not being fully honest with ourselves; that they're digging in in response to our provocation. Yet we were trying to hide it



But part of you suspects some truth in their accusation—and yet how could they possibly know about your malice? You barely knew it yourself. So their accusation can't be based on anything real. They must be projecting their own darkness onto you. _Strike three._



Now think of a time






This person is well and truly defective, justifying your contempt.

And the world is even worse than you'd feared, justifying your self-serving behaviors in general—while also making it harder for you to recognize them as such.

But part of you suspects you intended this. So you must bury it even harder...





---

You're in a group chat. Someone says something dumb. You type out a reply—nothing too mean, just... sharp. Clever. You can feel how it'll land. You hit send.

Three dots appear. Then stop. Then appear again. You can picture them staring at their phone, trying to figure out how to respond without looking stupid.

And you feel... what? Not quite guilt. Something else. But before you can really sit with that feeling: _well, they DID say something dumb. I was just being funny. Everyone else will see it that way too._

And yet, didn't you already feel something was off *before* you hit send?

That feeling of something being off—did it need to justify itself? Or was it just sitting there quietly, giving you the freedom to notice it or not?

Why does one part require justifications and the other not?

---

A response in the chat: someone calls you out in a nasty way.

Part of you knows their accusation has merit, and you... what? Thank them for helping you see the error of your ways?

Of course not.

All their words may be "correct," and yet you can sense they're not simply trying to be helpful. They're after something else.

What is it—and how do you know that they are?

---

What you were after in your original clever text, and what this person is now after—there's an uncomfortable similarity there, isn't there?

That dark hit of pleasure from making others feel *small.*

But your message felt so clever. And reading it back now, it *was*.

And yet they could sense what you were really after. How?

How did your *desire* for that little hit of enjoyment result in an outcome that delivered it?

---

You wanted the hit to land—but you also wanted to look innocent.

Don't we all know what that's like? Neither half alone is enough.

Be openly malicious, and we look like jerks—giving them an excuse not to feel small. Be genuinely kind and... well, kindness is great and all, but...

Do both at once? Provide *just* enough signal to let them know what we're after, while also giving ourselves cover?

*Jackpot*. Dark hit of pleasure, and nobody's the wiser.

---

This means you had to send two messages at once: "I want to hurt you" AND "I'll deny it if you call me out." That's a pretty sophisticated signal to be sending, isn't it?

If I'd asked you earlier if that's what you'd done, you wouldn't have just *feigned* ignorance—you would have genuinely had no idea what I was talking about.

How did you manage to send such a precisely calibrated signal without knowing that you were—and in a way that confidently predicted they would receive it?

That's not "I guess I kinda knew on some level" territory—that's active, conscious involvement. And now that I've pointed it out, can you see that it was?

Isn't that bizarre—discovering that you were consciously doing something that up until a minute ago you were sure you weren't?

---

So you both knew it and didn't. Now watch how both halves contributed to the execution of the ruse.

If you had *entirely* known it, then the "I'll deny it if you call me out" would have been half-hearted: it's hard to convincingly deny something you're fully conscious of.





Maybe some part of you knew you were intending harm—but you certainly didn't know that you were executing a ruse—let alone that you were *telegraphing* this to them, to ensure it worked.

And yet, you *did* know.

The only reason that your signal worked is that this malicious-but-innocent pattern is common knowledge: you knew about it, they did too, you knew they knew, they knew that, etc. That's how you knew it would land.

Which means it wasn't just conscious, but intentional.

---



 And how did we convey such a rich message through such a narrow channel?

Because it's an open secret.

We weren't just telegraphing our malice: we were signaling that we were pulling this very ruse.

---

If it's an open secret, doesn't that mean some part of us knew we were doing this, even as we did it?

Yet notice how hard that is to admit: I couldn't have just asked you whether your chat message was a malevolent ruse. You wouldn't have become defensive—you would have had *no idea what I was blathering about*.

And yet some part of you knew.

And it *knew* that you knew.

It even tried to *warn* you about it, while you were doing it.

---

Our conscience doesn't just haunt us after we've done wrong—it warns us that we're *trying* to do wrong, before the fact. That we're actively trying to darken the world while pretending we aren't.

Sounds like a pretty useful alarm system, doesn't it?







The classic angel and devil on the shoulders—we've been taught they're peers, but that's not quite right, is it?

Only one of them needs to defend itself. The other just sits quietly, knowing.

We don't know *how* it knows, but we also know we can't win a direct confrontation with it. We can try arguing, but that doesn't convince it—it only convinces *us* that we can't hear it, when we really can.

It's not quite judging us, and yet we feel the need to defend ourselves. Why?

---




Notice how different these two parts felt. The first one wasn't spewing out justifications—it just sat there, unmoved. It was the second one that needed to justify itself—as though it were trying to convince you not to listen to the first.


Think back to a time when you skirted your conscience—acted against your own deepest values while pretending it was okay.

In that moment, part of you knew full well that you were doing wrong, but you avoided looking at that knowledge, so that it didn't _feel_ wrong. All you could hear were your own clever justifications.

The knowledge wasn't unconscious. It was perfectly conscious—it just existed in a kind of limbo state: a bizarre, paradoxical schism of mind, in which you both _knew_ and yet somehow _didn't._ 

We know we can't win a direct confrontation with our conscience, and we can never truly silence it, so this is the next best thing: have our justifications live alongside it.

Try imagining doing something you know is wrong—_fully_ knowing it's wrong, with no rationalization—and doing it anyway. Can you even picture it?

The limbo state isn't just about avoiding guilt. It's how we _license ourselves_ in the first place. You literally cannot override your conscience without hiding the knowing from yourself.

It's a profound form of self-deception—but it doesn't make you bad. We all do it, as a kind of defense against a seemingly-uncaring world. In ourselves, we see it as a minor flaw, but when others do it, we see them as "bad"—giving us one more thing to have to defend against.

Notice how the limbo state was itself in limbo: you've always known about it but likely never brought it fully into conscious awareness.

## The Signal

Think back to a time you mocked, shamed, or judged someone with contempt. You probably told yourself you were doing it to help—if not them, exactly, then at least the world. But if you're honest, part of you just wanted them to feel bad, *quite independent of any good it would do*.

This is a bit malicious, so we hide it from ourselves—that limbo state—and yet our target senses it anyway. It weakens their faith in humanity and reminds them that the world is dark. This makes them feel more licensed in their self-deception—which we take as a sign of inherent badness. *Strike one*.

What you see is a person who became defensive in response to your righteous behavior, instead of introspecting and thanking you for your wisdom. They're implicitly accusing _you_ of being evil. _Strike two._

But part of you suspects some truth in their accusation—and yet how could they possibly know about your malice? You barely knew it yourself. So their accusation can't be based on anything real. They must be projecting their own darkness onto you. _Strike three._

This person is well and truly defective, justifying your contempt.

And the world is even worse than you'd feared, justifying your self-serving behaviors in general—while also making it harder for you to recognize them as such.

But part of you suspects you intended this. So you must bury it even harder...

---

But how does the ruse actually work?

Well, they couldn't just sense your malice—they could sense that you were hiding it from yourself. So they knew that if they called you out on it, you'd just feign ignorance—and really believe it. And you *wanted* them to know that, because that's what makes it so devious... and they could sense that, too. Which you *also* wanted them to know...

Can you feel how it spirals? The recursion doesn't stop—it just keeps reflecting, creating that dizzying hall-of-mirrors feeling. It's like a shared secret: "*we both know what I'm really doing... and that I'll get away with it, because there's no way you could ever prove something so absurd.*"

You didn't have to *do* anything to darken their mind. The hidden intent executed itself through this recursive spiral. The mockery was just a convenient delivery vehicle.

The hiding *is* the revealing. The intention *is* the execution.

---

Is there some part of you that benefits from knowing your enemies really are as bad as you feared—like it helps the world make sense?

Is there a part that would benefit from making them *worse*? It would certainly give you more leeway in dealing with evil. Loosen the shackles, so to speak...

That's a bit horrifying to think about. So that part would have to keep itself hidden from view—especially while it was busy accomplishing its goals.

Almost like it's doing your dirty work for you while giving you plausible deniability. 

---

Isn't there a part of you that already knows this is what's happening? That all of us are doing this, in various forms, all the time?

We all know.

So why is nobody talking about it? Why has it not been fully pulled out of collective limbo?

---
## Shielding

If you could see the person fully—if you knew their hopes, dreams, and fears—this would have been hard to pull off, wouldn't it? You had to shield yourself from something. But what was it?

Their full humanity. You don't actually need their life story to see yourself in them—that's just how you naturally are before any shielding. And even the shielding can't make it fully go away—it can only hide it. There's a part of you that always sees it, buried beneath the part pretending not to.

Which means the very feeling of contempt—for the *person themselves*, not just their beliefs or behaviors—is an unmistakable sign that you're in limbo. In that darkened state, you cannot help but intend harm—which your target picks up on.

---

What would happen if you turned that shielding knob up to its maximum?

Then you'd know what it's like to be *evil*.

Evil people don't do a different thing than the rest of us—they just have a stronger version of the same thing. It's not that they don't know they're doing wrong—it's that the knowledge is correspondingly better hidden.

---
## The Stranger

Now suppose a stranger walks in and scolds you for your behavior. Part of you _knows_ they're right in their accusation—that you're doing essentially the same thing that "evil people" do—but do you thank them for it and repent?

Hell no! You feel more justified in your behavior. You—a perfectly decent person who knows full well you've done wrong—still dig in your heels when treated with contempt. Why?

It's not just because of your big ego. It's because _you can tell they're not coming from a good place._ You can feel this independently of their words. How? No really, how?

What does that tell you about the people _you_ treat with contempt—even when you're saying all the "right" things; even when you're on the "right side?"; even when they're genuinely wrong?

So we already know that contempt darkens minds, and evil people have the darkest minds of all.

What exactly are we doing by feeling contempt for them?

---

## The Transmission

Now watch how the game unfolds—how the hidden signal actually transmits.

I know I'm only pretending to be better than you. And somewhere in me, I know you can sense this falseness—because part of me is projecting it.

Which means I know I'm being a hypocrite. And I know _you_ know that—you can feel the lie in my contempt. And I want you to know it, too.

Which means we both know I'm pulling a ruse. There's this weird shared awareness of the game being played. Have you felt that before—that you both secretly know what's really going on?

Each level feels different. The first is simple dishonesty. The second adds hypocrisy. By the third, shame starts trying to break through—so I have to hide harder.

And it keeps going, who knows how many levels deep, eventually reaching what feels like pure malice. And you both know that neither of you can prove it—which is why it works. 

It works not *despite* being unprovable, but _because_ of it. 

What kind of thing works like *that*?

What started as the simple lie of feeling superior—barely worth mentioning—has transformed into something truly monstrous.

---

You know your enemies can only cause harm due to a mechanism you share. So what makes them "bad," exactly?

Or does "bad" simply mean "okay to pull this ruse on?"

Yet it feels like we can practically *see* their badness, *feel* it, doesn't it? Why?

Maybe that visceral sense of *badness* is just what's needed for us to feel okay harming them.

---

Now think back to a time you acted out of pure integrity. Were any justifications needed?

And now a time when you did wrong and someone confronted *you* out of that same integrity. Did you want revenge? How could you tell they were coming from a good place? No, really—how?

What were they serving in that moment?

---

## We already know

Doesn't part of us already know this is how it works? **Why aren't we all talking about this?**

It's almost like a shared secret that we've all agreed to keep, lest we spoil the game for everyone. 

But what kind of game is it, and who's really benefiting?

---

Did your behavior with that person darken the world or brighten it? Didn't part of you know the answer even as you did it? *How* did you know? No, really—how?

And yet, it felt completely righteous at the time. You probably even could have proven that it was.

One part of you was knowingly darkening the world, while another part was flawlessly confident you were helping—and *both parts were conscious*. And you've always known this. So why do you think you can you trust your calculations about right and wrong in general?

We already know all this—so why hasn't humanity found a solution? All the self-help, spirituality, neuroscience... and we're still off the rails, maybe harder than ever before. How can that be?

Is it just because the _bad people_ keep sabotaging it? Or is there a part of us all that would benefit from *not* finding the solution?

Could that part be what's collectively steering this ship?

It sure would explain a lot, wouldn't it?
