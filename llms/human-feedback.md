On the short contempt recursion piece:

[11/18/25, 12:37:16 PM] Irwin Boutbol: Mystic argument
[11/18/25, 12:37:16 PM] Irwin Boutbol: Has defined a concept, but has not fully argued for it
[11/18/25, 12:37:17 PM] Irwin Boutbol: Most simplistically put, he is arguing that we don’t fully understand each other (see the light/good-parts) of each other. And we often do the same mistakes that we accuse of others. Hence, we are all similar. And by pretending to be different, we shove each other further in “darkness”. And we are stuck in the “halls of mirrors”. This may be true - humans cannot fully understand someone else - I would argue they dont even understand themselves. But he says that the way to stop this cycle is to let go of being right and see that we are all connected/one. This is a very common mystic argument - flavour of “everything is one with the universe”. It is seductive, indeed to think this way. But look at the solution he offers - he says that if we just recognize this sameness and unity with fellow creatures, things will get better. But her ignores that there are many other sources of conflict. Two free agents can fully be in valid conflict despite full understanding of each other just because they have different goals and value systems. For example, two people can fully understand each other, may even be identical twins with same upbringing, but they may have different sides on politics despite reading the same books and experience life similarly, because their value system is different. Also, given we cannot even fully understand our own selves, the project of understanding someone else so fully and achieve unity and sameness is futile - it is simply not possible (Even if you do it, the other persons will not), and if it is possible, there are many many other sources of conflict.
[11/18/25, 12:37:17 PM] Irwin Boutbol: The problem with these kind of blogs is that they are not philosophically rigorous. This is fine because most people are not philosophically rigorous and it is often OK to conjecture and wonder. But the deeper issue is that you see the same arguments being repeated, because the person is not well-read, so they present something that has been presented many times before. It may be valid or it may have been rebutted in the past. Presenting the same argument that many others have claimed in the past as if it is really novel (author says he “discovered it”) is unfortunately the problem of the internet. Back in the day your publisher would tell you that your argument is not novel and not publish worthy. But these days, everyone has a blog, so you get duplicative work.

[11/18/25, 12:53:03 PM] Irwin Boutbol: He can go read Gita - there Krishna tells Arjuna that all humans are just the same. That there is no self. That it is all an illusion. If there is no self, then all humans are same. And if all humans are same, there is no point in judging each other.

[11/18/25, 1:31:10 PM] Irwin Boutbol: Also, not all moral judgement of another person is from lack of understanding. It is often an accurate appraisal of bad behaviour. If some rapist rapes you, would you say to him “We are the same, I just didnt understand that I was getting raped by myself. Who am I to judge you? Just rape me"
[11/18/25, 1:31:10 PM] Irwin Boutbol: He tries to raise compassion and lack of judgement as higher truths, than moral judgement of other people, just because it has flaws (inaccurate judgement or hypocracy).
[11/18/25, 1:31:10 PM] Irwin Boutbol: Also, he may call it recursion, but there is a circular logical fallacy here:

He is saying:
1) I think you ar bad because I am hiding something about myself

2) The real harm is me accusing you of being bad while I am hiding something

3) The real reason I keep accusing you is because I am hiding myself

It is a loop - accusing you keeps me hiding, and hiding keeps me accusing you. The argument never really explains why this started or how to break out of it. That's circular reasoning.
[11/18/25, 1:31:11 PM] Irwin Boutbol: As far as the “implicit common knowledge” there are issues here. His idea of "implicit common knowledge" says that both people in a conflict secretly know they are deceiving themselves, even if they don’t say it. But this doesn’t rmake sense, because people don’t always realise when they are lying to themselves- self-deception can be unconscious (for example, when someone ends up doing harm despite best intentions, which happens daily). Also, true "common knowledge" means everyone is aware of the same thing, and everyone is aware that everyone else is aware, but this is just an intuition, not something we can clearly know or prove. Real "common knowledge" requires that something be publicly shared, and acknowledged — not just "felt" or "intuitively understood" without communication. The argument blurs the line between subjective awareness and shared verfiable facts
[11/18/25, 1:31:11 PM] Irwin Boutbol: There, I addressed both “recursion” and “implicit common knowledge”. I am unclear if he is trying to be rigorous/technical (for example, “common knowledge” is a technical term in game theory). If he is indeed trying to use technical terminology, then the argument is much weaker, for example common knowledge in game theory has a very specific meaning, which if he is intending to use is more problematic than if he is just giving a vague layman’s conceptual understanding of it.
[11/18/25, 1:31:11 PM] Irwin Boutbol: Either the article is a philosophically rigorous argument or a poetic mystic expression - if latter, we can live with it. If former, there are many issues.

[11/18/25, 2:14:12 PM] Irwin Boutbol: What a world we live in? I have to argue against LLMs and some random person on the web, via whatsapp
[11/18/25, 2:14:12 PM] Irwin Boutbol: He should just ask the LLM for holes in his arguments
[11/18/25, 2:14:13 PM] Irwin Boutbol: It is not even novel. He is describing a combination of two psychological factors - projection + cognitive dissonance i.e. we accuse someone else of something, it often reflects our own hidden flaws and we are actively deceiving ourselves and the other party that we are devoid of this flaw, and that we are merely projecting. So while he puts a new spin on it with phrases like “hall of mirros” metaphor, the underlying dynamic is not new at all. It is a complex way of explainting something psychology has long understood.
[11/18/25, 2:14:13 PM] Irwin Boutbol: Just because something is novel, doesn’t mean it is right. In fact, it is more of a signal for the author to test the claim more rigorously, because the current wisdom has not arrived at this claim despite having so many brilliant minds of history and so much time. But he chooses to be mystic and loosely use game theory terms, and is using LLMs to confirm his biases. Why not ask LLM to come up with holes in his argument instead of merely verifying novelty?
[11/18/25, 2:14:13 PM] Irwin Boutbol: If the author is getting a thrill out of the fact that the argument is novel (even if be wrong), he can continue to self-deceive himself to get that kick. But his article makes it seem like he cares about not deceiving himself. So, my claim is the author is himself a victim of the self-deception his article is trying to highlight. Oh the irony!
[11/18/25, 2:14:13 PM] Irwin Boutbol: This is a self-deception. The author has created something he is exciting himself with, and is OK that no one else is convinced. The goal of the article should be to convince at least a few other people and change their ways. It is intellectual masturbation really, nothing else.
