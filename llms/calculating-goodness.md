Consider Sam Bankman-Fried and FTX.

Here was someone genuinely committed to Effective Altruism—doing the most good possible with rigorous calculation. His plan: make as much money as possible through crypto trading, then give it all away to maximize human welfare.

The math made sense. If he could make billions and donate them effectively, he'd do more good than a thousand people volunteering at soup kitchens. **More good than those naive do-gooders who cared about integrity and following rules. More good than the irrational masses who couldn't see past their emotional attachment to "not stealing."**

**Can you feel the contempt embedded in that framework?** Not contempt he was _expressing_—contempt the framework itself _required_. To believe that breaking rules and ignoring your conscience is justified by the math, you have to hold some amount of contempt for the people who think rules and conscience matter.

And that contempt? It gave him permission. When customer deposits could be used to make risky trades that might 10x his giving potential... well, the expected value was clear, wasn't it? **Those customers didn't understand expected value calculations anyway. They were thinking small. He was thinking about saving the world.**

By the time FTX collapsed, $8 billion in customer funds had vanished. People lost their life savings. Retirement accounts, gone.

And SBF? He genuinely seemed confused about why people were upset. The math had been sound. His intentions were good. He was trying to save the world. **Couldn't they see that their suffering was just an unfortunate side effect of his attempt to prevent much greater suffering?**

**Notice how the contempt made the fraud possible—and then made it impossible for him to see what he'd done.**

Can you see the pattern?

The darkness didn't make him evil. It hijacked his genuine desire to do good and turned it into a sophisticated justification for fraud. And it did this by **first** hijacking his perception—making him see people as obstacles to good rather than the very beings he claimed to want to help.

The more rigorous his calculations, the easier it was to ignore his conscience whispering that _something was wrong here._ Because that conscience? That was just another irrational voice that hadn't done the math.
