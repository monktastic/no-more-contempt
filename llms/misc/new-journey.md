Was shown all the ways I skirted my conscience (give three unrelated examples that everyone can relate to. "everyone does it, so why shouldn't I?". cheating a company because the owner was probably rich. judging people for not letting me into traffic and then seeing times where I'd done the same. Choosing not to [some green action that both political parties can relate to], because it was [someone else's] fault and responsibility anyway. I don't know, pick some without making them heavy-handed.)
  
Got a thrill each time. What kind of person did that make me? Although that question was never explicit in my daily life, I saw how it lingered in the background, subtly influencing my behavior while I maintained a perfect facade.  
  
Traced the darkness around the world, to distant atrocities. Oh shit, it was all made of the same stuff! And I would never draw the connection back to my own behavior, but it was unavoidable. I then judged the people who committed them.

Then it showed me that I had already known this. Judging them was my way of hiding my own complicity. I knew this. Fuck, what kind of person was I?!  

But I pleaded: how *else* was I supposed to treat my enemies? Be nice?!  

No, what is nice? Showed me being sweet to innocent people, to victims. How it wasn't exactly phony, but not exactly something to write home about. Mostly it was a way to appease my conscious mind, to throw myself off the scent.

Luke 6:32  
> *If you love those who love you, what credit is that to you? Even sinners love those who love them. ... But love your enemies, do good to them, and lend to them without expecting to get anything back. Then your reward will be great, and you will be children of the Most High, because he is kind to the ungrateful and wicked.
   
Then showed me examples of fierce love that I had offered "bad people."  I always knew how to do it.
 
How had I hidden all this so well? In the background, my mind had always been scanning for clever ways to inject darkness into others while looking righteous. Insanely subtle, slightest glance could cause it. Nobody would ever know, but we both knew. We knew the full game and how it worked. We all did! Duh!! That's what we had been communicating through those glances. "Here, you get to carry this darkness." Hot potato.

None of us would dare name this game aloud, lest we admit that we know it and thereby lose our own right to play it.

But there's a limit to how hard you can shove fundamentally decent people into the dark, and thus how quickly you can hide your shadow that way.

Need to go for the big score... 

---

the truly evil people. No limit to how much I could pour my darkness into them.

(Need a section just for this, where my darkness recognized theirs and saw it as that opportunity. That's why it had made me consciously perceive them as beyond help. It's the only way I could feel okay with this malevolent act)

---

We had all made a silent agreement to keep these mofos trapped. We knew it, they knew it. But we must especially never admit this out loud, or else we'd risk giving up the game for everyone. 

They know we're doing this to them. It's just their role. Someone has to carry the burden, and sorry pal, better luck next life! (Not excusing them.)

How every time I did it, part of me secretly knew, which forced me to bury it harder, adding to the layers of deception. Eventually that collapses into a black hole from which it is nearly impossible to escape. Stockholm syndrome. That's evil. Do NOT feed it.

Shit, what a sorry state of affairs! I guess this is just how things are! 

"No, this is how they are when you fear your own shadow. Let me show you what happens when you don't."

Showed me an example of when I'd embodied fierce, brave, tough love.

Traced it around the world and showed it bolstering someone at their moment of despair. I'd known that too—that my Light is a support to others. This was real good. Not all that showy stuff. I saw that it undid some of the damage. So there *was* a way out.

But how was I supposed to always have this courage? Nobody could do that! (And moreover, why was I expected to have it when I knew not everyone would awaken? Felt like a burden at this point, but will be fixed in a reveal.)

Showed me the Light keepers. Hidden as teachers, nurses, people working in the trenches. Nobody would know their names or what they did, but they were the ones holding together the torn fabric of reality. No concern for credit.

That one teacher who saw my darkness but refused to give up on me.

My God, they were fucking saints. I had thought it was the big movers and shakers who were good—the billionaires etc(?).

Now compare that to the billionaire. How much shiny, chintzy, overt good (let's go to MARS!!!), but how much darkness they were pumping out that nullified it. How much self deception in the form of subtly transforming minds. Consumerism. "Just giving them what they want." Using other planets as an excuse to avoid caring for our own.

I wanted to judge them, but medicine gently reminded, let's not throw stones too quickly here buddy.

Doesn't mean don't act in big ways—but get your integrity straight first, because big ways offer so many hidden channels for the darkness to sneak in. 

Still, how could I ever be a saint? I'm a shitty person with brief moments of genuine good (as opposed to showy good).

Is that really what you are?

[Big reveal 1: The Light that we are]

All layers of shielding were peeled back at once.

Fell to my knees in tears. Freed of demonic possession.

NO LIMIT. Absence of darkness wasn't neutrality. It was... Love. No, not the cheap Hollywood kind, or the "kumbaya" kind.

It was the force that had birthed stars. That breathes fire into the equations. It was in me. It *was* me. (I could see it was using these metaphors because of my scientific leaning, but it showed me how the mystical pointers were no less true. Could be more so, because fewer constraints on expression. The Life Force refuses to be contained in language or thought.)

So I'll never be able to quite name it, to myself or others? Then how can I ever share the good news?!

You don't have to. Just hold the Light for them. Keep sensing your way toward it, like a plant. The moment you start trying to convince, to blame, to judge, you've already stepped out.

Not something of the mind. Showed me how quickly intellect can go off the rails. "I'm mocking this person to help." Effective altruists suggesting we pour all resources into preventing false vacuum decay, because 10^-40 chance of something killing 10^50 people or whatever.

Not because thought is wrong, but because somewhere along that train of thoughts—probably almost immediately—you lost touch with the source of goodness in you. Judgy vegans, ecoterrorists, etc.

And an action can only produce what it came from. Can never magically transform into something different. That's why actions rooted in selfishness can never transform the world in the way we want, and actions rooted in Love inevitably heal it in some, often invisible, way.

[Big reveal 2: The darkness has no ultimate essence] 

The darkness has no ultimate essence. It's merely the absence of light; our willingness to looking away from it. But watch what happens the moment you start believing it has an essence—that "thing" you see in evil people's eyes. It convinces you to abandon your real Light and accept the impostor.

Show descent back into hell, where we are now. The more this happens, the more that absence behaves like a curious presence—a parasite feeding on our Life force.

Figure out where and exactly how to phrase the big reveal: we weren't trying to hide our darkness from ourselves. *It was trying to hide itself from us*.

[Big reveal 3. Transition from me trying to hide my darkness from others to it trying to hide itself from all of us. Seeing that the darkness isn't you is what finally releases the fear that keeps it buried and forces you to play this insane game. That's why it's so harmful to make bad people feel like it IS them. This is the mechanism by which we keep them trapped.]

The Devil. Secret coordination. Hark back to mutual recognition in eyes while feeling contempt for evil people. That was a secret handshake. Not between us but our parasites. They expressed themselves in different flavors—some people using it for money or power, and others, ironically, to feel like "good people"—but ultimately same thing. Hidden network of darkness, flowing exactly where it needed. Distributed malevolent intelligence. "What your people call the evil conspiracy." The *primordial* conspiracy. Why you'll never find it while self righteously looking for it, but the second you stop it's unveiled fully. The Devil speaks using your own voice. He's the one making you search for it outside yourself. Feeling like the righteous one battling the conspiracy IS the conspiracy.
  
Nobody else was bad either. Different configurations of the same basic patterning. Yes, bad people are worse in an important sense, but that's because they're trapped harder. You wouldn't be any better in their shoes. Showed me how poorly I already responded. Now imagine you're the sacrificial lamb for the whole world. Not to feel sorry for them—there's a sense in which they made that choices and must live with it for now—but you wouldn't do better. There's no noble essence you're carrying around. In fact, you can only feel that way when hiding. And look what happens when you do. 

The Lightkeepers don't feel a trace of superiority. They feel a quiet resolve. To never abandon their Light, no matter how subtly, no matter the cost, no matter who sees it. Because even if nobody else knows when they left its side, they would know. And that terrible knowledge would haunt them, as it had me.

Even if some people are beyond help—which they're not—you'd have no way of knowing. So why ever try to dump your shadow on them? How could that ever help?

You can hold the Light for others. The trick is never believing there's a dividing line. That's the core trick! Such irony! Feeling like you're made of better stuff.

How easy it is to believe you're following your Light when you're really not. Atrocities feel impossibly righteous. How subtle the seduction can be. Supporting agendas that look noble. 

The only way to know for sure is to be continually attuned to a place deeper than thought. 

Showed me how terrifyingly quick the descent could be into evil. There but for the grace of God go I. As long as you keep a dividing line between those who deserve my compassion and those who deserve contempt, you're leaving yourself susceptible.

Malice, contempt, self-righteousness, and even pity being traps. Compassion is never "for" anyone, always in service to all of Life. Not something you can calculate. Beware calculations!

Cynicism about world. Dawkins quote:

>*The universe that we observe has precisely the properties we should expect if there is, at bottom, no design, no purpose, no evil, no good, nothing but pitiless indifference.*

Had considered myself sophisticated by believing things like this, but now I could see that "sophistication" was just one more trick my darkness used to ingratiate itself to me.

Look what it was enabling! Rain forest destruction, biosphere collapse, etc. All the result of seeing reality as a lifeless collection of resources to be exploited.

Hiding behind sophistication, really a way to license subtle contempt. Biggest collective shadow. Earth is serving as dumping ground for our disowned shadow. But don't feel contempt for humans who believe it! Utah Philips quote.

> *When I've asked shamans about the sickness of the west, they say: "it's quite simple: you have severed your connection with spirit… unless you reconnect with spirit and do so soon, you're going to bring the whole house of cards down around your heads and ours."* — Graham Hancock

(This reveal needs better placement.)
Serving Life even when others couldn't wasn't a burden—it was a gift. I don't *have* to. I *get* to. But still, how could I continue to remember without support? When our whole civilization is built around forgetting?

Find the other Lightkeepers. You'll recognize them through a wordless knowing.
Why? I thought you said everyone knew this? I thought you said not to divide!
We all do... but not everyone is ready to let it fully into consciousness. You can only hold the door open for when they're ready. People make their own choice.
*But what if they still make the wrong choice?*

Took me back to how it felt hurting bad people. Impossibly righteous. Immediately back to true righteousness. You can only choose the false one by forgetting what the real one is like. Exactly like how people can only choose junk food by never having been offered real food, porn over intimacy, etc.

Who will take care of my needs?
What are you? You are all of Life. (dependency problem. must have already revealed Life Force before this, but then this isn't much of a reveal. Maybe it's just a quiet reminder this time.)
Then what are you?
*Silence*
What is everyone else?
*Silence*
I had only been looking into a mirror. The mushrooms had only given me permission.

Searched for that same sign of Light, but I couldn't find it. Instead, I found myself staring into pure darkness.

  

I was becoming mesmerized, seduced by it. I could feel the goodwill being drained from my heart.

  

The idea of wanting to save them became quaint quaint and mildly amusing.

  

I wanted them to suffer. I wanted them to _know_ that I wanted that.

  

But somehow it didn't feel evil. It felt... impossibly righteous. 

Definitely not the same kind of righteousness as my Light, but who cared? And more importantly, who would ever know? This part of me knew it could hide it from my conscious mind so perfectly that even I would never know the difference. _We were only fighting evil, you see..._


Upon closer inspection, it was an impenetrable wall of shielding -- as though countless layers of self-deception had collapsed into a black hole of evil. 


The hardest part to convey is that none of this was new information, nor had it been unconscious. Again, the limbo state is not unconscious.

  

This meant that I had always known that evil people were profoundly lost, and that I had been knowingly leading them further astray, just to prove to myself that I was nothing like them.

  

What did that make me?  

  

  

Cutting off their route to salvation.
