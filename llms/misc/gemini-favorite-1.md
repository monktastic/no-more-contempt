Think back to a time when you skirted your conscience—acted against your own deepest values while pretending it was okay. In that moment, part of you knew *perfectly well* that you were doing wrong, but you shielded that knowledge from conscious awareness, so that it didn't *feel* wrong. All you could hear were your own clever justifications. Knowledge of your wrongdoing existed in a kind of limbo state, in which you simultaneously *knew* and yet somehow *didn't.*

This state of self-deception has enabled *all the evil there ever was.* Even the worst person can only cause harm by using this same trick to shield themselves from perceiving the life in their victims—that spark that reminds them of themselves. If they *didn't* hide it, they couldn't do it, which suggests there may be a deeper part of them—their inner Light—that doesn't want to.

But if that were true, it would mean that every time we've been cruel to our enemies, we've actually been harming fundamentally innocent but deeply confused people, likely reinforcing their need to lie to themselves—i.e., increasing their evil. And this, in turn, would mean that we've been doing exactly the thing we've been ruthlessly judging them for. That would be too painful to bear, and so we'd have to bury that knowledge at any cost.

But ironically, the best way to hide it would be to *do it even harder*—because the deeper we shoved them into the abyss, the harder it would get to recognize any trace of Light in them, ensuring that we saw no connection between our behavior and theirs. This would relieve a tremendous psychological burden, because then we would never notice how much of the world's darkness originated, paradoxically, from our need to hide our own.

Could it be that this is what we've been doing all along—that the only reason we've ever been cruel to "evil people" is to brilliantly avoid seeing something in ourselves?

If so, how would that work? By what mechanism could we be reinforcing the evil in others, given that most of us are rarely (if ever) outright cruel?

Whatever it is, we mustn't be conscious of its true purpose. Not only would our self-awareness reveal the trick to ourselves—defeating the whole purpose—but it would also reveal it to them, rendering it ineffective. So whatever this plan is, it must be hidden from our conscious minds—in which case, how could we possibly execute it? And how would it work in the first place?

The answer to both questions lies in a paradox of shared knowledge.

You see, not only do we know that we're not intrinsically superior to others; they *know* we know; and we *know* they know we know; etc. This is called *common knowledge*, in a [precise technical sense](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_knowledge_(logic)). It is therefore also common knowledge that *pretending* to be superior—and punishing them on that basis—is profoundly hypocritical, and will only reinforce their darkness; which we can then blame them for—which they also know; etc.

Therefore, when we harbor contempt, we're sending a secret signal that says: *I can see your inner Light but am choosing to smother it in the name of Good—and I'll get away with it, because there's not a shred of evidence I'm doing it. But we both know it.*

*This* is why our enemies dig in their heels when we mock, shame, and contemptuously judge them. It's not the behaviors themselves that cause it, but this malevolent taunt that we inject into them; a taunt that nobody—not even ourselves—can prove we injected. It's the perfect crime, because it doesn't look like anything and yet leaves no doubt about its true purpose.

Compare this to the story our rational minds tell us. Our enemies dig in their heels not because we encourage them to, but because, well, they're defective. Therefore, our behavior doesn't create *new* evil, but merely exposes the evil already there—a genuine service to the world. We can thus stop worrying about our own behavior and focus on what really matters: defeating the evil in others by any means necessary.

We have increased not only their capacity for self-deception, but our own as well.

What is it that makes such "common knowledge" possible? How can you and a complete stranger both know, on some level, about your own hidden hypocrisy, that the other one knows, that they know that you know, ad infinitum?

Could it be that beneath all the characteristics that make us different and special, there's something much more fundamental that we share—something unspeakably sacred that we *know* we share, and can never forget, no matter how hard we try?

Could it be that the harder we try to forget, the more it leaks out, encouraging others to forget?

That would explain why, when people commit evil, we feel a powerful invitation to overlook our shared humanity; and why, when we accept that invitation, we pass it on.

Or why, even when we feel contempt for them in their absence, we sense that we're darkening the minds of whoever we're with, knowing that they'll retransmit it, until it reaches its target—or people like them?

In the same way that our shared humanity is featureless, this forgetting is, as well. It does not care whether we're forgetting the Life in evil people, or innocent people, or animals, or other life, or Nature at large. It is all the same forgetting—and it is contagious.
