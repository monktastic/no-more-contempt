# Evaluation Instructions

First read vision.md from the project (and nothing else).
## Who You're Reading As

Simulate a reader in each of my two core audience groups:

**Group 1: Already know they're "The Light" (50% of spiritual readers)**
- Reading to understand: "HOW does darkness hijack goodness THIS precisely?"
- Will find it too long if insights are redundant
- Need: Every paragraph teaches something NEW about the mechanism

Experience for them should be: "Best explanation of evil's mechanism I've ever read"

**Group 2: Sensing something but don't have framework (your sweet spot - 40%)**
- Reading to understand: "WHAT is this thing I've been feeling?"
- Will find it too short if you rush to conclusions
- Need: Experiential building, each step necessary for breakthrough
- Has done serious personal development work or is interested in consciousness/spirituality
- Can recognize self-deception patterns in themselves
- Is curious about psychology, polarization, or what's wrong with how we relate to "evil people"
- Is somewhat skeptical but open-minded (not a hardcore materialist who rejects any non-physical explanations)

Experience for them should be: "This book changed my life - finally named what I've been sensing"

The piece is trying to reach about 80% of thoughtful people. It will lose the hardest-core skeptics (~5%) who would reject the conclusions anyway—that's acceptable. But it should keep most intelligent, open-minded readers.

Every paragraph must introduce either a NEW INSIGHT (satisfies Group 1) or keep the reader POWERFULLY ENGAGED in recognition (satisfies Group 2).

There must be **Zero redundancy + Deep experiential grounding**

## After Reading

Please share your honest reactions. You DO NOT need to answer every question—these are just guides for what would be useful to hear about:

### Immediate Reactions

- **Where did you want to stop reading?** (If anywhere)
- **Which insights hit hardest?** (Most devastating moments)
- **Which parts felt boring, redundant, or dragging?**
- **Did anything feel inauthentic or leading?** (Contrived examples, unearned claims)

### Ratings (1-10 scale)

- How devastating was it emotionally?
- How relatable were the examples to your own life?
- How much did you learn that you hadn't already articulated?
- How badly do you want to keep reading?

### Key Questions

- **Did you recognize yourself in the patterns described?** Or did it feel like it was about other people?
- **By the end, did you feel:**
    - Devastated by recognizing something in yourself?
    - Skeptical of the claims?
    - Confused about what was being claimed?
    - Bored or wanting it to move faster?
- **Would you send this to friends?** Why or why not? Who specifically would/wouldn't you send it to?
- **What's the single biggest improvement needed?**

## What It's Trying to Do (Context - Read After)

The goal is for readers to experience a cascading series of devastating recognitions about their own participation in spreading darkness/self-deception. Each insight should feel:

- Novel (genuinely new articulation)
- Relatable (you recognize it in yourself)
- Like something you already knew but had hidden

The piece should create desperate need to understand "what's going on here?" without letting you dismiss it with easy explanations.

# Evaluation by part

# Part I: Limbo

Trace EVERY LINE CAREFULLY. What does the reader know explicitly? What have they pieced together? Then evaluate:

- Every line should be doing work. 
- No line should feel unearned.
- No line should feel too obvious ("yeah you already said that"). 
	- Especially nothing I frame as a big reveal should feel like a letdown ("yeah I already pieced that together" or worse, "that was obvious before I started reading" or even "yeah that's textbook shadow, so what?"). 
	- It's okay if some readers know some stuff as long as they feel it might be new to most others.
- No line should be too psychologically threatening ("I'm not evil!") or too milquetoast.
- Every line should feel like it's building pieces of a bigger puzzle. 
- Every line should feel either experientially verifiable (through the example) or like it logically follows.
- When the reveals hit, the reader should feel "holy SHIT, that DOES follow from everything else I've already admitted."
- Especially it should feel like "fuck, part of me already knew every piece of this puzzle, which means I must have known the whole picture all along!"
- The punchline(s) should land like HAMMER BLOWS.
- Nothing should feel preachy.
- It should not meander.

Which parts still need work?
