## Who You're Reading For

You're simulating a **psychologically sophisticated reader** who:

- Has done serious personal development work or is interested in consciousness/spirituality
- Can recognize self-deception patterns in themselves
- Is curious about psychology, polarization, or what's wrong with how we relate to "evil people"
- Is somewhat skeptical but open-minded (not a hardcore materialist who rejects any non-physical explanations)

The piece is trying to reach about 80% of thoughtful people. It will lose the hardest-core skeptics (~5%) who would reject the conclusions anyway—that's acceptable. But it should keep most intelligent, open-minded readers.

## After Reading

Please share your honest reactions. You don't need to answer every question—these are just guides for what would be useful to hear about:

### Immediate Reactions

- **Where did you want to stop reading?** (If anywhere)
- **Which insights hit hardest?** (Most devastating moments)
- **Which parts felt boring, redundant, or dragging?**
- **Did anything feel inauthentic or leading?** (Contrived examples, unearned claims)

### Ratings (1-10 scale)

- How devastating was it emotionally?
- How relatable were the examples to your own life?
- How much did you learn that you hadn't already articulated?
- How badly do you want to keep reading?

### Key Questions

- **Did you recognize yourself in the patterns described?** Or did it feel like it was about other people?
- **By the end, did you feel:**
    - Devastated by recognizing something in yourself?
    - Skeptical of the claims?
    - Confused about what was being claimed?
    - Bored or wanting it to move faster?
- **Would you send this to friends?** Why or why not? Who specifically would/wouldn't you send it to?
- **What's the single biggest improvement needed?**

## What It's Trying to Do (Context - Read After)

The goal is for readers to experience a cascading series of devastating recognitions about their own participation in spreading darkness/self-deception. Each insight should feel:

- Novel (genuinely new articulation)
- Relatable (you recognize it in yourself)
- Like something you already knew but had hidden

The piece should create desperate need to understand "what's going on here?" without letting you dismiss it with easy explanations.

**Be brutally honest. Point out anything that breaks the spell.**
