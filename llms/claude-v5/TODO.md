## Part 1

- Metacrisis framing intro.
- Example of correction with integrity.
- Feels like you.
- Collaborating.
- Thinking harder cannot stop it.
- Every act of conscience-skirting.
- -  When it's seen clearly for what it is—with all filters removed—it feels *malevolent*; like I'm extinguishing a bit of light from this world. It's like this one single act somehow contains the distilled essence of *all the darkness there ever was.* Of *course* I'd have to turn away.
- I'm still fully responsible for the harm I cause—*including the downstream effects of having darkened your mind*—and yet judging me for it makes no sense. In fact, the only person who would *want* to judge me is someone still caught in the trap themselves. Think about it: do wise people treat others with contempt? No. 
- They may not even remember that they *have* a conscience. And when you treat them as if they don't, what happens? You give them permission to *forget more thoroughly*.
- The deeper my infection goes, the more I seek out others who are infected—the *bad people*—so I can teach them a lesson. And what lesson do I teach them? That *darkness is the way.*
- - Rationality as the only way out.
- Plausible deniability

"Try and recall a time when someone corrected you with integrity, without sneaking in contempt. Wasn't there something _different_ about it?

Even if it stung your ego; made you lose face, did you have any desire to take revenge?

No—and it's not because they were _nice._ Maybe they even had to be _more_ fierce. But you could still tell they were serving something beyond themselves, couldn't you?

What is that?

Even if they had a different race, religion, creed; even if you were enemies on the surface, something deeper felt profoundly _aligned_, didn't it?

It's like they were reminding you of something—something you'd temporarily forgotten. Almost like an external manifestation of your own conscience. You knew you couldn't win against it—and more importantly, you didn't want to.

Even if your behavior didn't change immediately, that planted a seed, didn't it?

What were they reminding you of?

What was _I_ trying to make you forget?"

---

When treating you with contempt, I am **sure** it will help somehow. I could probably even prove it.

And perhaps it does stop your misbehavior—at least, your *public* misbehavior, and for a time. But *by far* the bigger effect will come from having darkened your mind. Part of me knows this— that I've made the world as a whole slightly worse; increased its "net animosity"—but will I account for any of that in my calculations?

Of course not. My "objective assessment" will show that what I did was undeniably *good.*

The metrics are up! Hooray!

This is how "line goes up" while our biosphere quietly collapses. We can't measure something that we're all collectively hiding from ourselves.

---

We are radically, profoundly interconnected. I see you as fundamentally other because *I know you're not*. And if you're not—and you can do the awful things you do—then what does it say about me? So I must make **sure** you are other.

The cumulative effect of eight billion people lost in this "othering" is a humanity that sees *nature herself* as other—a lifeless pile of "resources" to be ruthlessly exploited for our own benefit.

---

"I know that your evil is secretly a muffled cry for help, filtered through countless layers of delusion, which is why it comes out so distorted. And I've just knowingly smothered those cries, to ensure that nobody will ever recognize them for what they are—all so that I can prove that the darkness lives in you, and not in me.

Deep down, you know I've done this to you—which is why you react the way you do. And I **know** you know this. But it's so horrifying that I must erase all trace of it from my mind. So I must push you so far into the abyss that no doubt remains that my behavior was righteous from the start.

If I could taste this in the moment of doing it, I would recognize it as **pure malevolence**—the distilled essence of all the evil there ever was. I am snuffing out the light in a fellow human. That's why I must "turn away" to do it.

This is why we cannot defeat the evil in the world. We need it to exist, because it provides cover for our own darkness. And the best part is, since fighting evil with integrity can be made to look similar to fighting it with contempt, it provides an ideal place to sneak our own darkness in  without anyone realizing what we're doing.

Evil people—they are the dumping ground for our collective shadow. It a secret we have all agreed to keep."

---

"This means that even as I'm viciously attacking you, there's a conscious part of me that knows it's punishing innocence; smothering light.

And it feels *fucking delicious.*

If that sounds malevolent, that's because it is. That primal, visceral urge to violently punish evil—it's not what it claims to be. It's ultimately the same thing you see in "evil people": the *desire to extinguish light from the world*.

The darkness—that's all it ultimately wants."


"What were they reminding you of? What was I trying to make you forget?"


"We're constantly signaling to each other when we've fallen under their sway"

---

There is no way to tell when you're under the sway of the darkness by thinking harder about it, because in that state, your mind has been hijacked in service of rationalization. The very tool you would use to detect the corruption has been compromised *by* it.

Let that sink in. There is **no way** to tell when you're lost in darkness by thinking harder about it. All your thoughts will only confirm that you're not.

And it goes much deeper than conscious thought. You don't just *think* your enemies are evil; you can practically *see* it, *feel* it, can't you? The darkness corrupts your mind at such a fundamental level that it prevents you from even fathoming that you're being fooled. What it's showing you simply appears as "reality." 

This is why "evil people" cannot simply be talked out of it. It is a self-sealing trap—and every one of us is caught in a version of it, to some degree or another. That is why we're so sure we're not.

---

To dehumanize you, I must turn away from my better nature. In fact, they're the same gesture: a kind of dimming of perception.

It's a turning away from *life itself*.

To ravage nature, people must turn away from the life in *it*; to see the forests, the mountains, the rivers as a mere collection of resources for our benefit.

It's the same mistake propagated at all scales.

So when I choose to dehumanize you—the one cutting down rainforests—I'm choosing to destroy *them.*

---

## Part 2

Until one day—through some kind of grace—I see that it was never **me** doing this.

I mean, it was and it wasn't.

To be clear, I'm fully responsible for all the harm I've caused, directly or indirectly, while under the sway of the darkness. That includes any additional harm *you* caused as a result of my having further darkened your mind. And yet it's not the "real me" doing this.

My better nature; my inner Light; the thing I had to turn away from to do this—**that's** the real me. But something was distracting me from it. And when I can really *see* this something, I see that I could never want it.

And neither could you.

---

"If you step back far enough, you'll see it behaves as if coordinated; as if a _single distributed pattern_ were operating through us. We are its control nodes.

Different cultures have had different names for it. Satan. The ego. Today we sense it as _the evil global conspiracy_—and we're not entirely wrong. There IS a conspiracy. It's just not 'them' against 'us.' It's this dark pattern conspiring through all of us."


---

> "The lies that corporations use to defile nature for 'shareholder value,' governments to send our young off to die in unjust wars, and me to feel contempt for the people in charge—it's all made of the same stuff: the willingness to overlook _life_."
