Let's dive deeper into how this thing works.

Say you gather with your political allies to plot how to defeat your enemies behind closed doors. Something about the energy of the room feels a bit "off," doesn't it? Your darkness recognizes it as a safe space to come out and play with the others.

Maybe you sense that "your team" is using the same dirty tricks you judge your enemies for—perhaps twisting their words to ensure they're seen in a bad light. But do you dare speak up in the presence of that energy? You know you'll be excommunicated if you do, don't you?

But by whom—or *what?* Any one of these people, in different circumstances, might be safe to confide in. But as a group? There's a synergy there that's difficult to grapple with.

It's almost like the dark parts of your mind are working together—yet there's no explicit coordination. In fact, any attempt to make it explicit would *destroy* the veil of plausible deniability that it requires. It's somehow operating in your shared blind spot; harnessing your shared intelligence.

And when you all walk away, and that temporary pattern dissolves, none of you will be consciously aware of the darkness you've injected into the world.
