I want to show you something about why the world is actively tearing itself apart—starting with something we've all felt.

---

Have you ever done something you knew was wrong at the time, but couldn't fully admit it to yourself until much later? Maybe you made a cruel comment to boost your ego, took credit for someone else's work, or cheated on a test (or even partner).

Bring to mind a specific example. Take your time.

Now try and remember what your experience was like between the time you did it and when you admitted it to yourself. The knowledge that you'd done wrong—was it *conscious* or *unconscious*?

You knew it was wrong even while doing it, so it couldn't have been _unconscious_. But would you call it _fully conscious?_ That's not quite it either, is it?

It was **conscious but hidden**—occupying a bizarre kind of *limbo state,* in which you simultaneously *knew* and yet somehow *didn't*. Try and recall what that was like.

It's like you had to shield the knowledge from your own mind—but why? Why did you have to hide it from yourself, and what were you hiding it *from*, exactly? Isn't there some part of you—call it your "better nature"—that wouldn't have tolerated it, if only it knew?

Imagine how much harm a person could cause from within this state—turned away from the full implications of their behavior. What would they look like from the outside?

Now imagine _eight billion people_ lost in it to varying degrees, each one blaming all the rest. What kind of world would they create?

---

Now suppose I catch you in this state, where you've caused obvious harm but are unwilling to own up to it. It makes me see you as a *bad person*—not just that you've done something bad, but that you *are* bad. So I treat you with contempt—by mocking, shaming, or silently judging you.

How does that make *you* feel? Even if you know you've done wrong, you only see me as a hypocrite and dig in your heels, right? But why? What's hypocritical about calling out bad behavior?

It's not the calling out itself, but the *contempt* woven into it—through my tone, gaze, etc. Contempt is a fundamentally dehumanizing posture: I'm perceiving you as *inherently defective*, and that has a certain dark quality to it. Can you feel that?

I'm revealing my own darkness to you while judging you for yours—in fact, _by_ (contemptuously) judging you for it. That would make *anyone* dig in, including myself—and yet I'm judging you for it.

And you can sense this isn't entirely unconscious, can't you? Part of me needs to prove you're the villain, and I'll do whatever it takes to confirm it. I know I'm doing this, but I can't quite admit it to myself—which is exactly the failure I'm judging *you* for.

I also know I could fight you in a way that doesn't reinforce it—doesn't let you use my darkness to justify your own—but it's like I'm choosing not to see it in the moment. Something in me *needs* to not see it.

I'm in *limbo.*

I'm blinded by how *righteous* it feels—like I'm punishing the evil in your mind. And there's **nothing** more primally, viscerally satisfying than violently punishing evil. Isn't that true? 

And the more evil a person is, the more righteous it feels. So it's fine if this makes you worse, because then I'll be "forced" to unleash the full extent of my righteous wrath—the most delicious feeling of all.

Seeing a so-called "good person" behave this way—what does it do to a mind?

It chips away at your faith in humanity. Even if some part of you wants to believe that genuine goodness exists, I've just shown you it's a myth. That at the end of the day, all that matters is what we can get away with; what we can prove—because here's the story I'm telling myself:

>*Fine, maybe there's some malice in here, but so what? Nobody can prove it—and anyway, intentions don't matter; only actions do! And my actions are clearly meant to fight evil!*

I **know** this is a lie, and you can somehow **see** this in me, even though I can't. And if that's the game I want to play, then game on! Why should you be the lone chump obeying your "better nature"? Fuck that.

I've just darkened your mind in a way that penetrates *deep* into your psyche. And I did this to maintain my own worldview—which is why I must never own up to it.

---

Suppose I had chosen to fight you differently—with complete honesty, free of any malice or self-righteousness. Do you see how I could have been just as fierce—maybe even violent—without justifying your darkness?

Recall a time when you *were* corrected with fierce integrity. Even if it stung your ego; made you lose face, you had no desire to take revenge, did you? Why not? What could you tell they were serving in that moment?

This is what makes the darkness so insidious: it can look almost identical to fierce integrity from the outside, and yet the two produce *drastically* different long-term effects. Even worse, contempt and malice *can* temporarily suppress misbehavior, making them *appear* to work.

This is how the vast majority of darkness in our world operates—in this gray zone, where we can _sense_ something sinister lurking just under the surface, but can never quite prove it. Corporate lies. Shadow operations. Institutional betrayal.

We think we're _fighting_ it all through our little acts of subversion, but we're secretly strengthening it. Nobody can prove we are—not even ourselves—and so we all throw our hands up and wonder why it's all going to Hell. It must be *someone else's* fault.

All the while, the darkness is slithering between minds, infecting them, without leaving a trace of evidence behind.

And the worst part of all this? Even the *perpetrators* don't know what they've done. After treating you with contempt, do I recognize I've darkened the world? Of course not. I feel _righteous_.

The darkness—it *always* feels righteous.

---

Here's the hardest thing to confront: the darkness acting through my mind is not fundamentally different from what I'm judging in yours. At its core, what it boils down to is the willingness to overlook the *life* in another—be it a person, animal, or nature at large.

I have to dim my perception in a certain way to see you as *defective*, or to harm you—and it's exactly the same move that people make to commit genuine atrocities, or to defile nature.

Dimming my perception of life and turning away from my better nature—they're the same gesture. Darkness *is* the act of "turning away"—and every time any one of us does it, we reinforce the same tendency in others. It is *infectious*.

Darkness is ultimately a profound form of confusion—and the desire to punish people for it is secretly the desire to *strengthen* their confusion, making my own harder to notice.

It lets me get away with more self-serving behavior, because I can justify it as necessary. I can shave off a little extra for myself here or there and call it "sticking it to the man," or overlook aspects of my agendas that I would otherwise have recognized as selfish or harmful.

But here's the weird thing: wouldn't I rather have a world in which people didn't have to do that at all?

So despite these "benefits" it buys me, this part of me is actually working *against* my true best interests. And it can only do this by hiding the full implications of my behavior from me while I'm doing it.

It has bought us all off.

---

Why is there an aspect of my mind that's working against me—strengthening the darkness in my enemies, and in the world at large?

And isn't yours working toward the *same* goal? Why should that be, if you and I are supposedly enemies?

So there's a part of my mind that turns me away from my better nature in order to create a world more hospitable to *it* and less hospitable to *us*—and yours and mine are working together.

I feel like we should get to the bottom of that.

---

So what's really going on here?

Your "better nature"—it isn't just a nice part of you. It's what you most fundamentally are: that fierce drive to protect Life. But there are other aspects of mind—driven by fear, pride, etc.—that get easily confused for the real thing. And when they are, a darker world inevitably ensues.

It turns out the same is true of everyone else—but your own confusion prevents you from seeing this. It makes their darkness appear *intrinsic*, so that you can't help but feel contempt—and we already know where that leads.

Now watch how our dark parts operate. Yours triggers mine. Mine provokes yours. We both pass it on. But here's what's strange: they're not just bumping into each other randomly. Mine seems to _know_ exactly how to trigger yours in a way that benefits both of ours—as if they're following the same playbook.

And it's not just between individuals. When allies bond over contempt for a shared enemy, each person's darkness validates the others'. The room gets darker together, but everyone leaves feeling _more_ righteous, not less.

Scale it up further: watch political polarization. Each side's worst behavior recruits for the other side. The worse 'they' get, the more justified 'we' feel—and vice versa. Both sides growing darker while convinced they're the ones fighting evil.

If you step back far enough, you'll see it behaves as if coordinated; as if a *single distributed pattern* were operating through us. We are its control nodes.

I know that may sound like "woo." But weaker framings miss crucial aspects of this thing—aspects we *need* to see in order to fight it effectively.

Different cultures have had different names for it. Satan. The ego. Today we sense it as _the evil global conspiracy_—and we're not entirely wrong. There IS a conspiracy. It's just not "them" against "us." It's this dark pattern conspiring through all of us. And here's its cleverest trick: it uses our conviction that we're fighting it to perpetuate itself.

We've sensed the elites are playing regular folks off each other to keep our attention off them, but even they are pawns in a much larger game. This thing is playing _all_ of humanity off ourselves to keep our attention off _it._ It *needs* us to hate them, to keep itself going.

The feeling of being the righteous one valiantly fighting evil? That's not you fighting it. That's it using you.

Thus, everything comes down to recognizing its presence in your mind and eliminating it. Only from there can you free others.
