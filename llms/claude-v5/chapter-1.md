**The Pattern: Part I**
**The paradox that enables all evil**

Suppose I see you as a *bad person*. I can't help but feel contempt, and so I mock, shame, or just silently judge you. I'm confident it will help somehow—but for some reason, it only makes you see *me* as a bad person and dig in.

Ugh, I was right about you: you really are beyond help.

But under the covers, something much darker is taking place.

What I'm doing is **dehumanizing** you; choosing to see you as fundamentally defective. And I know there's only one reason people do that: to cause harm without having to face the horror of it. To do that, we must shield ourselves from fully perceiving the life in our victims; our profound commonality. Otherwise, the deepest part of us—our *better nature*—would never allow it.

So deep down, I know this is true of you, too—which means I know you *have* a better nature. But I'm pretending you don't, for a very specific reason: this way, I can weave something predatory through my words and actions—something I know you'll feel, but which no one can prove.

I'm showing you that your worst fears are true; that this world really is the cruel, unforgiving place you already suspect it is—which we both know is the reason you cause harm in the first place. I want you to see that I know this—and that I could choose to rescue you from the abyss instead of shoving you deeper into it.

But I'm not going to do that, and nobody's going to blame me for it.

In fact, *I myself* won't know I've done this—because I know how to hide my darkness from myself just as well as you do. So I'm going to sleep like a baby, and I want you to know that.

I'm only *fighting evil*, after all—and how could that ever be wrong?

---

Why am I doing this?

The truth is, there's darkness in me that I'm not ready to face. So to avoid confronting it, I project it onto you.

It's not that you don't have any yourself. Of course you do, which is why I latched onto it. But I need yours to be of a **fundamentally different nature** than mine. I need there to be **inherently defective** people out there—because otherwise, how do I make sense of the great evils of the world? Might I be connected to them? Maybe even *complicit*?

No. That can't be.

So I **must** prove that other people are defective. But since I identify as a "good person," I can't just do this willy-nilly. I must do it in a way that even I won't recognize as dark—and "bad people" provide the perfect opportunity, because hating them is "good."

Now, projection is usually understood to be an unconscious process, but that belief is actually a defense mechanism. What I'm doing is **fully available to consciousness**—I'm just hiding it from myself so that it *feels* unconscious.

On one level, I know exactly what I'm doing—because *showing* you this is central to its function. But at the same time, I'm hiding it from myself—because if I **fully** saw it, there's no way I could do it. Nor could I blame you for your reaction, which is the whole point.

So both of these halves—the knowing and the not-knowing—must operate in **parallel** for it to work. It requires a kind of **split consciousness**.

If you've ever been on the receiving end of a dehumanizing gaze, you know what this is like. Doesn't the person seem somehow *absent* or "turned away" from themselves? That's what you were sensing in me. It is the very **essence** of evil.

The core mistake is that I've drifted from my better nature. But I don't realize, because my mind is filled with clever rationalizations about how **righteous** it is. Without that, I never would be willing to drift.

By failing to stay connected to my better nature, I induced the same mistake in you. That mistake is **infectious.** But neither of us will recognize that this is what happened.

Instead, we'll both be increasingly confident that the darkness lives only _out there_—so we can't afford to be constrained by our naive conscience. We slowly replace its voice with our own clever judgements, until the very idea of a "better nature" feels like mystical nonsense.

In this way, we lose contact with the only means we have of detecting the infection. The self-serving aspects of our actions become easier to overlook; to justify as necessary or even noble. 

This is a harsh world, after all. Sometimes you have to get your hands dirty.

---

Notice what just happened.

An aspect of my mind lured me away from my better nature by pretending to *be* it—through that delicious feeling of *righteously punishing evil.* Then, having taken over my mind, it revealed itself to you through my tone and gaze; even as it hid itself from me.

I both knew I was doing this and didn't—and it's that eerie quality that showed you I was in its grip, even while I feigned ignorance.

But "feign" isn't even the right word—because there is a genuine sense in which I don't know I'm doing this. There **must** be, because I honestly couldn't do it if I could fully see it.

That's the hallmark of the darkness. People know *perfectly well* when they're in it—and they also don't. The worse a person gets, the more **both** halves are amplified. They see the part that doesn't know, and we see the part that does. This makes us feel morally compelled to rub their noses in it—not realizing that we can only feel this way by having fallen under its sway ourselves.

It thereby colonizes both of our minds more deeply, while we each become increasingly certain that we're the ones free of it. We then both go on to spread it.

Even the rare few who claim to embrace evil are just fully turned away from themselves—they've simply lost all memory of what it's like to be turned *toward*. And our desire to punish them serves the same dark purpose: to ensure they never remember, so that we can remain special.

This raises the baseline darkness level of the world—which means that my "righteous" behavior has just increased the risk of genuine atrocities being committed somewhere, somewhen. Every one of them—whether committed against other humans, animals, or nature herself—depends on exactly this *turning away* I've just modeled.

The darkness—*it's all one thing*.

This is exactly the complicity that I've been working so desperately to avoid seeing. And since I've just added to it, it's now even harder to face. My only option is to do it more.

---

Let's take stock.

On one level, I'm sure I'm behaving righteously. At a deeper level, I'm increasing the darkness in the world to provide cover for my own. But at the ultimate level, something even stranger is happening.

This "darkness": it isn't really me—even though I am **fully responsible** for the harm I cause while lost in it. That includes any additional harm you go on to cause as a result of my having darkened your mind.

My "better nature" is my *true* nature—who I would really be in the absence of all self-deception.

Which means the darkness is like a kind of parasite.

What happens when this parasite increasingly infects all of humanity?

That's what we'll explore in later posts—but even now, you can probably sense the answer.

---
---





For now, reflect on the following thoughts.

- This split consciousness—where one part of me is doing my dirty work, while another is kept clean—does it remind you of anything?

- While treating you with contempt, I'm lost in darkness—but **no amount of thinking about it** would reveal this to me, because that very "darkness" has hijacked my thinking mind. Yet there is a part of me that *does* know. So why does our society trust **only** the rational part of ourselves? Which part of us would benefit from getting this profoundly wrong?
---










But deep down I know that I *did* cause this. I've just shoved you deeper into the abyss; further into the very confusion that enables evil in the first place. I've separated you further from your true nature—the Home you desperately long to return to, even if you no longer consciously recognize it.

I know that your evil is secretly a muffled cry for help, filtered through countless layers of delusion, which is why it comes out so distorted. And I've just knowingly smothered those cries, to ensure that nobody will ever recognize them for what they are—all so that I can prove that the darkness lives in you, and not in me.

Deep down, you know I've done this to you—which is why you react the way you do. And I **know** you know this. But it's so horrifying that I must erase all trace of it from my mind. So I must push you so far into the abyss that no doubt remains that my behavior was righteous from the start.

If I could taste this in the moment of doing it, I would recognize it as **pure malevolence**—the distilled essence of all the evil there ever was. I am snuffing out the light in a fellow human. That's why I must "turn away" to do it.

This is why we cannot defeat the evil in the world. We need it to exist, because it provides cover for our own darkness. And the best part is, since fighting evil with integrity can be made to look similar to fighting it with contempt, it provides an ideal place to sneak our own darkness in  without anyone realizing what we're doing.

Evil people—they are the dumping ground for our collective shadow. It a secret we have all agreed to keep.

---

People hide the life in their victims to commit atrocities; I hide the life in the perpetrators to wish harm on them; humanity hides the life inherent in nature so that we can pillage it for profit. It's all the same fundamental mistake; the same act of *turning away.* And it is **infectious**.

Your darkness elicits my own (which I pretend it doesn't), causing me to reinforce yours. Going forward, we're both more likely to overlook the self-serving aspects of our own actions and agendas, because they suddenly become *necessary* or *righteous*—what any reasonable person would do when confronted with such a shitty world. And so we spread the infection to others.

My unbridled contempt for the people knowingly destroying the rainforests—it is destroying the rainforests. Part of me knows it, and as long as I keep hiding this from myself, I ensure that they will keep hiding it from themselves—because we're not as separate as we seem.

We are radically, profoundly interconnected. I see you as fundamentally other because *I know you're not*. And if you're not—and you can do the awful things you do—then what does it say about me? So I must make **sure** you are other.

The cumulative effect of eight billion people lost in this "othering" is a humanity that sees *nature herself* as other—a lifeless pile of "resources" to be ruthlessly exploited for our own benefit.

---

When treating you with contempt, I am **sure** it will help somehow. I could probably even prove it.

And perhaps it does stop your misbehavior—at least, your *public* misbehavior, and for a time. But *by far* the bigger effect will come from having darkened your mind. Part of me knows this— that I've made the world as a whole slightly worse; increased its "net animosity"—but will I account for any of that in my calculations?

Of course not. My "objective assessment" will show that what I did was undeniably *good.*

The metrics are up! Hooray!

This is how "line goes up" while our biosphere quietly collapses. We can't measure something that we're all collectively hiding from ourselves.

---



---

When I treat you with contempt, it's as though part of my mind is doing my "dirty work" while another part keeps its hands clean. What does that remind you of?

[split consciousness.]

*Plausible deniability.*

When groups of people, blissfully unaware of their own shadows, form organizations—what is the natural result?

Corporations that "don't know" what their lobbyists do, governments that "don't know" what their intelligence agencies do, executives that "don't know" what their subsidiaries do.

None of it requires explicit coordination or top-down enforcement by mustache-twirling villains. It's the natural, inevitable, synergistic effect of our individual self-deceptions.

Every time any one of us skirts our conscience for any reason—say, by shaving off a little extra for ourselves, justifying it as "sticking it to the man"—we are secretly making humanity more susceptible to that same self-deception.

It's as though all our dark parts are secretly **coordinating**—through vast and subtle networks, operating just out of sight.

That's why it sometimes feels like there must be an evil global conspiracy coordinating all the madness. In a certain sense, there is—just not the kind we normally imagine. All our darkness together behaves like a **singular malevolent distributed entity**—one with control centers in each of our minds.

The belief that I'm standing outside the "conspiracy," valiantly fighting it—that's the surest sign that it's still operating through me.

---





Yet there **is** a part of you that actually knows.

When you're acting against your better nature, part of you **knows** it. This part doesn't speak the language of rationalization. It just sits there, quietly, knowing.

And *because* it doesn't try to convince us through reasoning, we think it is naive and foolish. So we treat it that way—and by doing so, convince others to do the same.


---

The darkness in me—it is robbing humanity of faith in the Light; of the perception of genuine Life. There is something unspeakably precious and sacred about this place that we can never quite put our fingers on. Something beyond words and concepts.

I am taking that from us, and it is too painful to confront. So I do the only thing I know how: hide it harder, by renewing my hatred for those awful people doing it to us.

---

Until one day—through some kind of grace—I see that it was never **me** doing this.

I mean, it was and it wasn't.

To be clear, I'm fully responsible for all the harm I've caused, directly or indirectly, while under the sway of the darkness. That includes any additional harm *you* caused as a result of my having further darkened your mind. And yet it's not the "real me" doing this.

My better nature; my inner Light; the thing I had to turn away from to do this—**that's** the real me. But something was distracting me from it. And when I can really *see* this something, I see that I could never want it.

And neither could you.

The darkness—it is a **parasite**. It lures me away from my better nature by pretending to *be* it. It knows I would never follow it if it came out and announced itself as "evil." 

That's why it feels so righteous to hate the "bad people." Why there is **nothing** more primally, viscerally satisfying than violently punishing evil. These *must* feel righteous, because that's the feeling it must imitate to



This is every bit as true for me as it is for the most despicable person. People only commit evil because it feels impossibly **righteous**. It's just pointed at the wrong "righteousness."


It **must** imitate the Light because it knows that's where our ultimate allegiance lies; what we ultimately **are.**

And the more I forget this about myself—the more susceptible I am to confusing one for the other—the more I induce this same mistake in others, through nearly every action I commit.

---

Now watch how this mistake propagates.

When I see darkness in you, it triggers the darkness in me, which reinforces it in you. Or perhaps instead of confronting you directly, I foment contempt *for* you through my so-called "allies." 

Either way, it's as though our dark parts are exchanging a kind of secret handshake beneath our usual conscious thresholds.

But remember: it's not truly unconscious. It's conscious but hidden.



---

Cannot think your way out of it

---

A mind turned fully toward itself remembers itself as the All. It recognizes itself in everyone, and *as* everyone and everything. In this state, malice, contempt, self-righteousness, etc. are simply impossible. There is only Love—but it's not a weak or naive thing. It is *infinitely fierce* and powerful, doing only (and exactly) what must be done.

The further turned away a mind is, the more it perceives everything as "other"—and by doing so, induces this same misperception *in* those "others." Beyond a certain point, we call this state "evil"—but we're all in it to some degree or another before *enlightenment*. In it, we have the perception that we are inherently different from the "bad people."

---






This kind of interaction is so common that we may not realize just how profound a truth it reveals.

At the deepest level, I only want to do right by the world. Another way to say this is that *the true nature of mind is compassion*.

So the only way I can wish harm on you is by *hiding* something from myself—namely, your humanity; our profound commonality. This is something I would normally see by default.

To hide your humanity, I must hide *from myself* in a certain sense; from my deepest nature. If you've ever been on the receiving end of a dehumanizing gaze, you know what that's like. Doesn't the other person seem absent, or somehow "turned away"? That's what you're sensing.

But do *I* know when I'm in that state? Yes and no.

Yes, because I'm doing it for a purpose: to harm you (or benefit myself) without feeling bad. But also no—because if I were *fully* aware of it, I couldn't do it. You can't rationalize something while seeing through the rationalization.

So when I'm turned away from my better nature, I both *know* that I am and *don't.* It's a bizarre, paradoxical state of mind that is both *conscious* and yet somehow *not*—**and it underlies all the harm we cause one another.**

Normally, I don't care whether you know I'm in that state—for example, when I'm displaying open malice. But contempt adds an extra wrinkle. When I accuse you of being a bad person, part of me *wants* you to know I'm in it.

Why?

Remember, I only dehumanize to get something out of it. What am I getting out of it here?

Well, when you dig in your heels, I get a little hit of self-righteousness of being *right* about you. It preserves my worldview, in which I'm one of the good guys valiantly fighting the hordes of evil.

Now, how does *showing you that I'm dehumanizing you* help me accomplish this goal? Pause and see if you can answer that.

Part of me *knows* you can see exactly what I'm doing—that I'm pulling a ruse to prove myself right about you. And I *also* know you can see that I'm hiding it from myself. I know that this combination will madden you and make you dig in your heels—and you can see that I know this, and *also that I'm hiding it from myself.*



This layer-upon-layer of nested hiding and revealing **is** "the ruse" at the start of the recursion—and the whole thing is so maddening that it makes you dig in your heels.



Can you sense the recursion here? It's very tricky, so let's slowly tease it apart.

I know I'm separated from my better nature, but also I don't.

At some level, I know this is visible to you—but at another level, I don't.

The fact that I know it and am doing it anyway means that part of me *wants you to see that I know it*. But I'm also hiding it from myself and know you can sense this—which means that *I want you to see that I'm hiding it from myself*.







I both know what I'm doing and don't. I know this combination is visible to you












Part of me knows I'm dehumanizing you, of course


When I'm dehumanizing you, part of me knows all this. It knows that I'm lying in order to benefit myself in some way—either by harming you or licensing some kind of selfish behavior.




Now, contempt is a fundamentally dehumanizing attitude. I'm perceiving you as *inherently defective*. And not only do I know this, and that I'm hiding it

I know this is harmful, but I'm hiding this fact from myself—and you can sense that.





You see, I can only cause (intentional) harm by shielding myself from the *life* in others. Without that shielding, harm is very difficult, because the very deepest part of me doesn't want it.

And seeing you as defective is fundamentally dehumanizing. You instinctively recognize this as exactly that kind of shielding



(This may seem like a bold claim, but try to feel into it. We'll try to justify it later, but for now let's see where it leads.)

Therefore, by seeing you as inherently morally defective, not only am I lying, and you *know* I'm lying, but I know *that*, and you know *that*... Not at a conscious level, of course—but we both sense it.



The true nature of mind is compassion.

This truth is unveiled in its entirety upon _enlightenment_, but it’s available (if somewhat hidden) to everyone at all times.

The more clearly I recognize it in myself, the more clearly I see it in you, and vice versa—and again, because it's what you are, this perception can never be exactly zero.

Now, because the thing we’re seeing _with_ is the thing _being seen_, a recursion is created: like two eyes gazing into each other, each sees that the other sees that the other sees, etc.

Which means that when I contemptuously accuse you of being a _bad person_—when I see you as _fundamentally defective_—not only do I know it is a lie, but part of you _knows_ that I know, and I know _that_, and so on. (This is known as _common knowledge._)

It makes you see me as a hypocrite, which I deep down know is true (but hide), which makes you see me as even *more* of a hypocrite, which I'm forced to hide harder, ...

Resulting in a kind of a hall-of-mirrors effect that you may be familiar with.

We both know what's really going on, and also that if you try to name it, I'll use it against you. After all, I'm only fighting evil. How dare you accuse *me* of being evil?

The thing is, your accusation is correct. But what "evil" am I actually committing? Pause and see if you can answer this yourself.

Sure, I'm treating you with contempt, and that is harmful. **But it's only harmful because it's based on a lie, *and that lie is common knowledge*.**

I am openly displaying that I'm willing to lie to benefit myself—to feel superior to you. And I know this will madden you in a way that nudges you further from your better nature, which is what lets me feel superior.

It is a **trap**. But the only thing that *makes* it a trap is that I'm willing to execute the trap while pretending not to. It is recursive, self-referential, paradoxical.




The answer is that I know this will rob you of faith in humanity—and choosing to do it anyway **is** what robs you of faith in humanity. Do you see how it's self-referential and paradoxical?




It’s uniquely maddening, isn’t it? I know what I’m doing but I’m hiding it from myself. And I’m revealing _that_ to you while hiding it from myself. And I’m revealing _that_ to you while hiding it from myself…

So the harm isn’t just in the initial accusation—it’s in the full recursive structure of the trap. Showing you my willingness to harm while hiding it **is** the harm. It is **self-referential.**

To put it in more everyday language: I’m showing you that even the so-called “good people” will lie to get what they want, as long as they can get away with it. And if I’m willing to abandon my better nature so easily, why should you be the lone chump expected to obey yours?

_F*** that._

In other words, I’m demonstrating that _genuine goodness_ is a myth—that this world really is the cold, lifeless, “every man for himself” place you deep down fear it is.

I am robbing you of faith in the Light. _That’s_ the harm.

And I would never do that if I could see what I was doing. I can only do it because I’ve already lost faith in it myself.

By drifting from my _true nature_—the Light—I’ve just nudged both of us further away from it.

---

But is it really "I" who did this? This is the strangest thing to describe.

By drifting from the Light, it's almost like something *else* took control—something not quite me.

It's almost as if *the darkness itself* has a kind of intelligence. It lured me away from my better nature through clever rationalizations, and then, having done so, *displayed itself* to you through my eyes.

Haven't you ever felt that, when being dehumanized? It's like the person is oddly absent.

And mine only lured me away because it saw that same darkness in you. Saw *itself* in you...

Almost as though the two are *collaborating* beneath our conscious thresholds—in a bid to extinguish Light from this world.

Am I responsible for the harm I cause when mine is in control? **Absolutely.** And yet, does it make sense to contemptuously judge me for it? But who would do that, except for someone under the sway of their own?

What would the world look like if eight billion people were caught in this trap? If all our blind spots were "collaborating?"

Well, how do people behave when dehumanized? Are they likely to be kinder to each other? To animals? To nature at large? Or are they more likely to overlook the life in *all* of it; to objectify it; use it for their own benefit, because of how shitty the world has been to them?

Wouldn't we create systems that codify this misperception?

And notice how it operates within myself. Part of my mind was busy doing my "dirty work" while another part got to keep its hands clean. What would that mechanism look like when scaled up to organizations, governments, etc.?

*Plausible deniability.*

Shadow operatives, corporate lobbyists, etc.

So here's what such a world would look like: like there were a vast network of darkness operating just beneath our conscious thresholds. The biosphere would be collapsing and the social fabric degrading. Every one of us would be flawlessly confident that we're valiantly fighting it.

And the people at top, responsible for all the madness? We'd treat them with *contempt.*

And that would be the fuel that ensured the machine stayed running.

---

The darkness—it's not ultimately real. And yet, the further we drift from the Light, the more it acquires the *perception* that it is. It's that eerie possessed quality you see in the eyes of "evil people"—and the same one you display to others when you show them contempt.

There's only one way out of the mess we're in, and every one of us knows it deep down.

We just have to *remember*—and by doing so, help "others" remember.

Though perhaps, in the end, there aren't truly any "others."

---

*Author's note:*

This is a radically condensed version of a much longer piece I've been trying to write for ages. It's still very rough around the edges, particularly around the operation of the "vast network of darkness."

The ending should not be taken to suggest that spiritual development is an *alternative* to acting in the real world. It often happens *through* it. There are genuine injustices, real conspiracies, people who must be stopped, etc. Fighting them with compassion doesn't mean being nice.
