## Evil people

Bring to mind the "bad people" of the world—whoever you think is responsible for ruining things for the rest of us. Maybe it's the hypocritical CEOs, greedy bankers, corrupt politicians—and all who support them.

They seem to lack something fundamental that the rest of us have, right? A moral compass.

Would some tiny part of you be disappointed to discover they're *not* fundamentally evil—that they're just badly confused but inherently redeemable people like the rest of us? Would that part feel robbed of the right to deliver the righteous vengeance they so richly deserve?

If you had to choose between delivering that vengeance and offering them a pill that would instantly enlighten them—which would you choose? Forget about the "right" answer. Is there a tiny flicker in there that's itching to mash that first button?

There is **nothing** more primally, viscerally satisfying than violently punishing evil. Notice that.

## Contempt and Integrity

Think back to a moment you felt contemptuously judged by another person. No matter how "right" they may have been; even if you *knew* you had done wrong, you still fought back, right? Something felt *off* about them. You could tell they weren't coming from a good place. How?

Now think of a time when someone set you straight with profound integrity—seemingly getting nothing out of it themselves. Even if it stung your ego; made you lose face, you had no desire to take revenge, did you? Why not? What could you tell they were serving?

Now turn it around.

Think of a time when *you* contemptuously judged someone. Even if you tried to hide your contempt, they still dug in their heels, didn't they? And somewhere inside, that resistance confirmed what you already believed.

And finally, a time when you corrected someone with integrity yourself. Perhaps you had to do it with more ferocity; more violence than in the previous case—and yet something in you knew it would ultimately bring *more* peace. *How* did you know?

---

That time you stood in integrity, and the time the person who corrected you did: even if you knew nothing else about them—their politics, their religion, their creed—didn't it feel like you were somehow serving the same thing? What is that?

And the time you stood in contempt, and were treated with contempt: didn't it feel like *those* were somehow serving the same thing? Not just your personal egos, either.

Integrity feels clean from both the inside and outside.

Contempt feels righteous inside but dark, dirty, insincere from the outside.

There's a reason for that distinction.

---

When we mock or shame our enemies, part of us already knows they're liable to dig in, right? And we know there's a way that *doesn't* cause this. So why do we still do it? Is it just because we can't help it?

Notice: their digging in brings them one step closer to a condition that can only be solved through violent punishment.

But this can't be right. We're not... trying to maneuver our enemies into a position where we'll be forced to unleash our righteous wrath, right?

Right??
