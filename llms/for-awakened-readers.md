# Implicit Common Knowledge of Non-Dual Recognition and the Recursive Dynamics of Performative Contempt

### How denying our shared, already-seen Light causes every accusation of bad faith to bootstrap its own infinite hall-of-mirrors justification.

---

The closer I get to my own Light—pre-egoic consciousness—the easier it is for me to see yours. That's because it's in the nature of Light to recognize itself—which means I also know that the closer you get to yours, the more you'll recognize mine.

But there's another thing I discover here—which is that it was never actually absent from my experience. I see, in retrospect, that I'd *always* been able to see it—I'd just been hiding it from myself.

Which means I also know that it's present in your experience **right now**, wherever you are on this path. And so part of you *already* recognizes mine—you're just hiding it from yourself. In fact, any two people already recognize it in each other.

Moreover, because the thing they're seeing *with* is the same thing *being seen*, they both see that the other sees theirs, and that they see *that*, etc.

This is perhaps more easily understood by analogy with two sets of eyes gazing into each other: both see not just the other, but that the other sees them, that the other sees them seeing them... *ad infinitum.*

This is what game theorists call *common knowledge*—a condition where everyone knows that everyone knows that everyone knows etc.

Normally this requires that a trusted party speak the knowledge out loud[^emperor]—but in this case neither of us is trusted nor did we speak it aloud. So this is *implicit* common knowledge.

Now watch what it enables.

The only way I can feel malice or contempt for you is by shielding myself from our equality—and this fact is common knowledge.

So when I *do* feel those things, it's common knowledge that I'm deceiving myself—but nobody can prove it. This is already maddening—but the real magic happens when I contemptuously accuse you of being a *bad person.*

We both know I'm being a hypocrite—doing the very thing I'm accusing you of. But this knowledge lives in a hidden corner of my mind. So when I sense that implicit accusation from you, I’m forced to hide it harder. But now you (correctly) sense I'm pulling a ruse—so I have to hide that. And now you (correctly) sense that I'm covering up the ruse, so I have to hide _that_…

The whole thing becomes a maddening hall of mirrors that makes you dig in your heels—which, conveniently, confirms you’re the bad person I said you were. After all, I was only trying to help!

But now look back at step one: _“we both know I’m doing the thing I’m accusing you of doing.”_ What is that thing? Causing intentional harm.

But where did the harm actually happen? Not in the accusation itself, and not even in the lie behind it. The harm comes from the entire **hall-of-mirrors** effect: a “good person” staging an elaborate performance of sincerity to make you look bad.

That’s the part that hits hard. It scrambles your sense of what’s real, makes you doubt whether people mean what they say, and chips away at your faith in humanity. And _that_—that erosion of trust—is the real harm.

In other words, the *base* of the recursion depends on the predictable *result* of the recursion. It is a **strange loop**—and it only works because we (at some level) know that this is how it works.

Don't we already know that contempt makes people dig in? What we may not have realized is that *this is why we do it.*

The reason we deceive ourselves into seeing others as truly other is to reinforce the sense of othering in the shared field. We're not ready to see the truth yet—that "others" **are** us—and we demand that our experience reflect this insanity back to us.

It is this unreasonable demand on the world—that it accurately reflect our confusion—that keeps the illusion spinning; preventing it from relaxing into its true condition.

A world in which "evil people" cause harm through not recognizing their victims as themselves, in which we hate them for doing so, and in which they use that to justify their misperception: it's **exhausting**, but it's the only one we know.

If we were to stop feeding it—by giving up our need to be "right" in the contempt spiral—the strange loop would collapse, settling into a stable equilibrium: a fixed point requiring no further maintenance, in which we could finally come to rest.

We would see that evil people **are us**—just lost deeper in that hall of mirrors. And we would finally stop shoving them deeper into it.

I don't know how long it would take for the whole system to settle. But I do know there's no other way for it to come to rest.
