HUMP 1: Why I Do This (The Line)

Need evil to be alien
Drew the line so darkness could FEED
SLAM: "Oh fuck. Oh FUCK."
Fiendish ruse, vicious feedback loop

That line I drew in the sand—between those who deserved my compassion and those who deserved my contempt—it would mean I drew it [specifically to have people I could perpetrate this ruse against.] It was only ever a way for the Devil to keep its foot in the door of my mind.

Is that insight there anywhere? You need to make it more poetic, because it's also a SLAM moment. My darkness knew I couldn't just hurt good people. So I maintained a line beyond which it could FEEEEED.


HUMP 2: The Coordination (Secret Handshake)

When I push them in, I get darker too
Build to: "They weren't fighting. They were in ALLIANCE."
SLAM: "Holy shit. HOLY SHIT."
My darkness knew it was using theirs
Everyone doing it - massive distributed network


When I push someone further in, I take it as proof that they're defective. Which means this world sucks. Which means my self-serving agendas are justified after all. The devil is darkening us BOTH at the same time. Mine isn't attacking theirs—they're coordinating. Each instance makes BOTH parties worse. It ingratiated itself to BOTH of us, so that we embrace it harder while feeling more certain we're free of it ourselves and that the badness lives only OUT THERE, where I now have incontrovertible proof that I must fight it more bitterly.





HUMP 3: How It Actually Works (The Mechanism)

NOW show the shielding mechanism (this is HOW the handshake happens)
Evil threshold
"Be kind" realization - SLAM: "It was ONLY EVER about refusing to handshake with their fucking devil"
The nice-mean misdirection
Evil people same mechanism, maxed out
Hypocrisy all the way down


> *Be kind, for everyone you meet is fighting a great battle.*

I'd prided myself for following it. Set it as my [social media] status. But I always interpreted it as:

Be kind, for MOST people you meet... Except for those fucking evil people, who you should hate. 

But I saw that kindness had NOTHING to do with being NICE. It was ONLY EVER about NOT SERVING THE FUCKING DEVIL!!!



This way the "be kind" revelation LANDS because you've just seen the secret alliance. Kindness = refusing to participate in the handshake.
