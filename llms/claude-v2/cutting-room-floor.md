# Part I

[Alt ending: Maybe we've been looking in the wrong place?]
[An example of fighting evil with integrity?]







The full ruse requires them to be aware of your malice while you aren't. How does *that* work?

Try this: imagine giving someone a dehumanizing glare. It sends a shudder down the spine—because it feels like it somehow contains the distilled essence of evil, doesn't it?

That look would certainly convey malice—but you'd be aware of it, which has two problems: first, you'd both know their accusation was right, so the ruse would backfire. And second, you can't really do this to someone with full awareness, can you? Your basic human decency prevents it.

But if you did it from the limbo state? It would solve both problems at once.

They would not only sense the malice; they would instinctively recognize that you're shielding yourself from it, meaning you know it's a ruse. And they'd sense you know that, too, adding on plausible deniability. And you clearly know that, too...

And the recursion doesn't stop there; it keeps on going. Can you feel that? That hidden-yet-revealed-ness gives it a hall-of-mirrors quality—and *that's* what makes it work.

It would spread darkness without you having to *do* anything, and without leaving any evidence behind.

That's what contempt *is*: a way to guarantee transmission of this malevolent signal while covering its own tracks. The mockery was just a convenient delivery vehicle.

The hiding *is* the revealing. The intent *is* the execution.

Diabolical.

## The Purpose

But here's what's strange: you needed them to get worse. Not just look bad in that moment—but actually *become* worse. More defensive, more self-deceived, darker.

Why?

Because you needed to prove their badness was *fundamental*. Built into who they are. Not caused by you—*revealed* by you.

When they got defensive in that moment, you immediately saw it as proof of their nature. Not as a response to your contempt. And when they got worse over time, that just confirmed it. "See? I was right about them all along."

If they were just confused, if they were redeemable, if your contempt actually *made* them worse—then you'd have to face that you darkened someone who could have gotten better. That you took someone struggling and pushed them deeper. That your contempt was just cruelty.

But if they're fundamentally broken? If your contempt just revealed their true nature? If they were always going to end up here?

Then your contempt was justified. You were just seeing clearly. Maybe even protecting others by exposing what they really are.

The mechanism protects itself by erasing its own causation. By making their worsening—both immediate and over time—look like revelation, not consequence. By turning your contempt from cause into diagnosis.

You needed them to get worse so you could believe you didn't make them worse.

---

At the time, you genuinely felt like you were helping.

Not "partly helping." Not "helping despite some doubt." You felt completely convinced you were doing the right thing. The certainty felt real. The righteousness felt earned.

And yet, simultaneously, you were executing the ruse. Consciously. You knew you were spreading self-deception. You knew you were making them worse. You knew you were hiding this from yourself.

Both were happening at once. Not one beneath the other—both conscious, both you, at the same time.

You were the one genuinely convinced you were helping. And you were also the one executing the pattern. The same you. In the same moment.

How is that possible?

The limbo state is consciousness doing something seemingly-impossible—holding contradictory knowledge simultaneously, with full awareness of both, while somehow preventing the left hand from knowing what the right hand is doing.

You cannot calculate your way to goodness when your calculating itself can be operating in this state—genuinely convinced of its righteousness while executing something else entirely.

---

But it's not just what you do directly to them. Think about when you mock someone to your friends. Your allies. People who already agree with you.

You're not trying to change the target's behavior—they're not even there. So what are you doing?

You're getting your allies to join you in contempt. To see this person as you see them. To share your righteous judgment.

And it works. They laugh. They add their own mockery. You feel more bonded with them through this shared contempt. It feels like solidarity. Like being on the right side together.

But what you're actually doing is recruiting them to spread it. Each person you've shared your contempt with is now carrying it. Will mention it to others. Will look at the target differently when they encounter them. Will be slightly colder, slightly more ready to judge.

You've coordinated a collective darkening.

And you knew this. Part of you knew you were spreading it through your allies, creating a coalition of contempt that would make this person's world darker from multiple directions.

But it felt so righteous. So justified. So much like solidarity with your people against the bad people.

---

Think about the last time you felt superior to someone. Not necessarily contemptuous—just... better. Smarter. More aware. More evolved.

Maybe they didn't get a joke. Maybe they held a belief you'd moved past. Maybe they were struggling with something you'd figured out.

You were patient. Helpful, even. But beneath the patience—can you feel it?—there was something else. A looking-down. A subtle "I'm better than you."

Did they sense it? Did they get quieter, more defensive? Or did they push back harder than seemed warranted?

And you thought: "I was just trying to help. Why are they being difficult?"

---

It's woven through everything.

The way you explained something "obvious" to someone. The patience that barely concealed your frustration. The helpful correction that carried a whiff of superiority.

Each time, they sensed something beneath your words. And each time, they got a little more defensive, a little more closed off.

And each time, you felt a little more justified in seeing them as... less than.

The mechanism doesn't just operate in contempt for "bad people." It operates in subtle superiority, in self-righteousness, in any moment where you position yourself as fundamentally better.

All of these—the overt mockery, the recruited allies, the subtle superiority, the "helpful" corrections—might seem like different things. But they're the same mechanism: positioning yourself as fundamentally better while hiding that positioning from yourself. The same transmission. The same defensive response. The same spiral.

---

I'll give you a specific example from my own life.

I was explaining something technical to a colleague. They weren't getting it. I stayed patient—impressively patient, I thought. Kept my voice calm. Explained it multiple ways.

But I could feel it underneath. The subtle "how are you not getting this?" The barely-hidden frustration. The sense that I was being generous with my patience, that they should be grateful.

They got defensive. Started explaining why their approach actually made sense, why I was missing something. Got more entrenched in their position.

And I thought: "See? They're being stubborn. I'm trying to help and they won't listen."

But they sensed what I was hiding from myself. The looking-down beneath my patience. And that's what they were responding to. Not my words—my hidden positioning.

I made them worse while feeling like I was helping. And used their worseness as proof they were the problem.

I did this while genuinely convinced I was being helpful.

## The Recognition

Some part of you knew how to make them sense your malice while hiding it from yourself. Knew you'd both know what was happening. Knew neither could prove it.

And it executed on this vision while convincing you that you were helping.

And none of the things I pointed out are new information to you. You only recognize them because you _already knew about them_. They were just hidden in limbo.

Which means that part of you already knew that this mechanism was operating in you.

But wait.

The limbo state isn't some unconscious process beyond your control. It's not a mechanism that happens TO you.

It's YOU. Knowing something while hiding that knowledge from your conscious awareness.

Which means:

YOU knew how to make them sense your malice while hiding it from yourself. YOU knew you'd both know what was happening. YOU knew neither could prove it.

And YOU executed on this vision while convincing yourself that you were helping.

How do I—a complete stranger—know this about you?

---

Think back. Have you ever corrected someone—maybe even firmly—while genuinely giving them the benefit of the doubt? Not writing them off, not seeing them as fundamentally defective, but addressing their behavior while still seeing them as... reachable?

It felt different, didn't it? You didn't need the limbo state. There was nothing to hide from yourself. You weren't positioning yourself as better—you were serving something else. Something higher than proving your superiority.

And it had a different effect. Even if they didn't like being corrected, something in them could tell you weren't coming from contempt. The correction might have landed. Or at least it didn't make them worse.

Now think about being on the receiving end of that. Someone corrected you, but you could tell—beneath their words, independently of their words—that they weren't looking down on you. They were genuinely trying to help. Not to prove their superiority. Not to make you feel small.

Even if you didn't want to hear it, even if you resisted, you could sense the difference.

You already know how to tell. You've always known.

So why is it so hard to stay connected to that? Why do we keep slipping into the other thing—the contempt, the superiority, the looking-down—even when we've seen that it makes everything worse?

That's what I saw the answer to. Not in words—in a way that bypassed language entirely. And I've been trying ever since to reconstruct it in a form that might actually communicate it.

The medicine didn't give me new information. It brought old information out of limbo—the same way I'm trying to do for you now.

All at once. With a force that left no room for the usual defenses.

It wasn't revelation. It was recognition. And that recognition changed everything.

---

Everyone I know does this.

Not "everyone has flaws." This specific pattern. The same hiding. The same transmission. The same three strikes. The same result.

Think about someone you know. Different personality, different background. Now think about a time they felt contempt for someone.

They did the exact same thing you just did, didn't they?

We all just know how to do it.

---

This isn't some subtle insight. This isn't advanced psychology. Every single person knows what contempt feels like to receive. Every single person knows it makes you defensive. Every single person has seen someone get more entrenched when mocked.

This is completely, utterly obvious.

So why is nobody talking about it?

Why has no one named this clearly?

How have we all gone our whole lives doing this without someone pointing it out?
