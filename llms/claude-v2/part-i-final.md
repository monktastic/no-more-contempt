# The Pattern: How Evil Hijacks Our Goodness

> _For so long as the root of wickedness is hidden, it is strong. But when it is recognized, it is dissolved. When it is revealed, it perishes. ... It is powerful because we have not recognized it._ — The Gospel of Philip

## Prelude

Once, on a "heroic dose" of psilocybin, I was shown something that shattered my understanding of good and evil. It wasn't a gentle insight—it was a cascading series of revelations, each more horrifying than the last, that demolished my entire worldview and replaced it with something infinitely more mysterious and meaningful.

Two decades later, I'm still reeling from the consequences.

What I saw wasn't just about psychology or morality. It was about the fundamental architecture of evil itself—how it operates, how it spreads, and most disturbingly, how it uses _our own goodness_ as its primary transmission vector. 

I saw something that every major wisdom tradition has warned about: there is something that hijacks human consciousness, and its most brilliant trick is convincing us it doesn't exist—or worse, that it only exists in _them_, the _bad people_.

What follows is an attempt to show you what I saw—and why it matters more urgently than almost anything else we could be paying attention to right now.

I came to call this coordinated system of self-deception "the pattern"—or, when it shows its face, "the darkness."

Can you feel it—the *evil people* out there, ruining it for the rest of us? How they lack something fundamental that the rest of us have—or maybe that you, specifically, have?

How do they make you feel? How do you want *them* to feel? Be totally honest.

Would some tiny part of you be disappointed to discover they're not *fundamentally* evil—that they're just badly confused but inherently redeemable people like the rest of us? Would that part feel robbed of the right to deliver the righteous vengeance they so richly deserve?

What is that part of you trying to accomplish?

What is it *actually* accomplishing?

# Part I: The Mechanism

## The Limbo State

Think back to a time when you skirted your conscience—acted against your own deepest values while telling yourself it was okay. In that moment, part of you knew _perfectly well_ that you were doing wrong, but you shielded that knowledge from conscious awareness, so that it didn't _feel_ wrong. The knowledge existed in a kind of limbo state—a bizarre, paradoxical schism of mind, in which you both _knew_ and yet somehow _didn't._ All you could hear were your own clever justifications.

Now try this: imagine doing something you know is wrong—_fully_ knowing it, with no rationalization, no "but this is different because..."—while still doing it. Can you even picture it? Or does the full knowing prevent the action?

The limbo state isn't just how we avoid guilt. It's how we _give ourselves permission_ in the first place. You literally cannot override your conscience without first hiding the knowing from yourself.

Notice how the limbo state was itself in limbo: you've always known about this mechanism but likely never brought it fully into conscious awareness. It's extremely obvious when you see it.

## The Signal

Think back to a time when you mocked or shamed someone you considered bad. You probably told yourself you were doing it to help—to correct their behavior, to protect others, to make the world better. But if you're honest, part of you wanted to make them feel bad, quite independent of any good it would do.

And yet they sensed it anyway. They could tell you were relishing their suffering.

How? You barely knew it yourself. It was buried deep, shielded from your own conscious awareness.

And yet somehow it reached them.

This weakens their faith in humanity. The world just got a little darker. So they feel more of an urge to protect themselves—which often means more self-deception. You perceive this as inherent badness. _Strike one_.

What you see is a person who became defensive in response to your righteous behavior, instead of introspecting and thanking you for your wisdom. Instead, they're implicitly accusing _you_ of being evil. _Strike two._

Part of you suspects some truth in their accusation. But how could they possibly know about your hidden malice? You barely knew it yourself. So their accusation can't be based on anything real. They must be projecting their own darkness onto you. _Strike three._

This person is fundamentally defective. The world is even worse than you thought.

You now feel _more_ justified in your self-serving behaviors, while being less likely to recognize them as such.

But part of you suspects this, too—that the whole thing was a ruse. So you bury it even _harder_...

---

"But wait—maybe they were already defensive? Maybe I was responding to their bad faith, not causing it?"

Fair. Try this: think of a time when someone treated you with contempt because you were being difficult.

Were you being difficult before their contempt? Probably yes.

Did their contempt make you less difficult? Or more?

Be honest. Even when you were genuinely wrong, even when you deserved correction, did their contempt help you see that? Or did it make you dig in harder?

The pattern works both ways. Even when someone is genuinely wrong, contempt makes them worse, not better.

The mechanism doesn't just spread. It reinforces itself. Each time you execute the pattern, it becomes more hidden, more automatic, more necessary. The shame of seeing what you're doing makes you hide it deeper. Which makes it operate more smoothly next time.

It's learning. Getting better at hiding itself from you.

---

Your malice was hidden from you but visible to them. _Both halves were necessary._

If they couldn't sense it, the mechanism wouldn't work—they wouldn't get defensive, wouldn't give you permission to write them off.

If you _could_ sense it, the mechanism wouldn't work—you'd feel too guilty to follow through.

The hidden intention to cause harm was somehow enough to actually cause it. Almost as if it was telegraphed to them while being kept hidden from you.

And yet it happened exactly as if you had consciously planned it.

---

## The Stranger

Now suppose a stranger walks in and scolds you for mocking that person. Part of you _knows_ they're right in their accusation—that you're doing essentially the same thing the "bad people" do—but do you thank them for it and repent?

Hell no! You feel more justified in your behavior. You—a perfectly decent person who knows full well you've done wrong—still dig in your heels when treated with contempt. Why?

It's not just because of your big ego. It's because _you can tell that they're not coming from a good place._ You can feel this independently of their words. How? Can you sense how they're not being fully honest with themselves?

What does that tell you about the people _you_ treat with contempt—even when you're saying all the "right" things; even when you're on the "right side?"

---

Think about what this means. If contempt makes even you—someone who knows you were wrong—dig in harder... what does it do to someone causing real harm?

It makes them fight harder. More defensive. More entrenched.

If you actually want to stop harmful behavior, contempt is counterproductive. It's not a tool for change. It's a tool for feeling superior while making the problem worse.

---

## The Knowing

When you mocked them, they weren't just reacting to your malice. They were reacting to something bigger—the whole dark pattern, including your attempt to hide it from yourself.

And you _knew_ they knew. Which you had to hide. And they knew that, too.

Have you felt that before, while doing it? That you both secretly know what's really going on? That you're both aware of the game being played, but neither of you can acknowledge it without breaking the spell?

I know I'm pretending to be better than you. That's what my contempt signals—a claim that, at some level, I know isn't quite right.

And somewhere in me, I know you can sense this falseness.

Which means I know I'm being a hypocrite. And I know _you_ know I'm being a hypocrite—you can feel the lie in my contempt.

Which means we both know I'm pulling a ruse. There's this weird shared awareness of the game being played.

Each level feels different. The first is simple dishonesty. The second adds hypocrisy. By the third, shame starts trying to break through—so I have to hide harder.

And it keeps going. You both know what's happening. You both know the other knows. You both know this exchange is making both of you worse.

But neither of you can prove it.

And that unprovability is what makes it work. Not despite being unprovable—_because_ of it.

If you could prove what was happening, the spell would break. The unprovability is structural. It's what allows this to keep operating while you both know exactly what's happening.

You did this while genuinely believing you were helping.

---

## The Purpose

But here's what's strange: you needed them to get worse. Not just look bad in that moment—but actually *become* worse. More defensive, more self-deceived, darker.

Why?

Because you needed to prove their badness was *fundamental*. Built into who they are. Not caused by you—*revealed* by you.

When they got defensive in that moment, you immediately saw it as proof of their nature. Not as a response to your contempt. And when they got worse over time, that just confirmed it. "See? I was right about them all along."

If they were just confused, if they were redeemable, if your contempt actually *made* them worse—then you'd have to face that you darkened someone who could have gotten better. That you took someone struggling and pushed them deeper. That your contempt was just cruelty.

But if they're fundamentally broken? If your contempt just revealed their true nature? If they were always going to end up here?

Then your contempt was justified. You were just seeing clearly. Maybe even protecting others by exposing what they really are.

The mechanism protects itself by erasing its own causation. By making their worsening—both immediate and over time—look like revelation, not consequence. By turning your contempt from cause into diagnosis.

You needed them to get worse so you could believe you didn't make them worse.

---

At the time, you genuinely felt like you were helping.

Not "partly helping." Not "helping despite some doubt." You felt completely convinced you were doing the right thing. The certainty felt real. The righteousness felt earned.

And yet, simultaneously, you were executing the ruse. Consciously. You knew you were spreading self-deception. You knew you were making them worse. You knew you were hiding this from yourself.

Both were happening at once. Not one beneath the other—both conscious, both you, at the same time.

You were the one genuinely convinced you were helping. And you were also the one executing the pattern. The same you. In the same moment.

How is that possible?

The limbo state isn't something that happens beneath consciousness. It's consciousness doing something impossible—holding contradictory knowledge simultaneously, with full awareness of both, while somehow preventing the left hand from knowing what the right hand is doing.

You cannot calculate your way to goodness when your calculating itself can be operating in this state—genuinely convinced of its righteousness while executing something else entirely.

---

But it's not just what you do directly to them. Think about when you mock someone to your friends. Your allies. People who already agree with you.

You're not trying to change the target's behavior—they're not even there. So what are you doing?

You're getting your allies to join you in contempt. To see this person as you see them. To share your righteous judgment.

And it works. They laugh. They add their own mockery. You feel more bonded with them through this shared contempt. It feels like solidarity. Like being on the right side together.

But what you're actually doing is recruiting them to spread it. Each person you've shared your contempt with is now carrying it. Will mention it to others. Will look at the target differently when they encounter them. Will be slightly colder, slightly more ready to judge.

You've coordinated a collective darkening.

And you knew this. Part of you knew you were spreading it through your allies, creating a coalition of contempt that would make this person's world darker from multiple directions.

But it felt so righteous. So justified. So much like solidarity with your people against the bad people.

---

Think about the last time you felt superior to someone. Not necessarily contemptuous—just... better. Smarter. More aware. More evolved.

Maybe they didn't get a joke. Maybe they held a belief you'd moved past. Maybe they were struggling with something you'd figured out.

You were patient. Helpful, even. But beneath the patience—can you feel it?—there was something else. A looking-down. A subtle "I'm better than you."

Did they sense it? Did they get quieter, more defensive? Or did they push back harder than seemed warranted?

And you thought: "I was just trying to help. Why are they being difficult?"

---

It's not just in the obvious mockery. It's woven through everything.

The way you explained something "obvious" to someone. The patience that barely concealed your frustration. The helpful correction that carried a whiff of superiority.

Each time, they sensed something beneath your words. And each time, they got a little more defensive, a little more closed off.

And each time, you felt a little more justified in seeing them as... less than.

The mechanism doesn't just operate in contempt for "bad people." It operates in subtle superiority, in self-righteousness, in any moment where you position yourself as fundamentally better.

All of these—the overt mockery, the recruited allies, the subtle superiority, the "helpful" corrections—might seem like different things. But they're the same mechanism: positioning yourself as fundamentally better while hiding that positioning from yourself. The same transmission. The same defensive response. The same spiral.

---

I'll give you a specific example from my own life.

I was explaining something technical to a colleague. They weren't getting it. I stayed patient—impressively patient, I thought. Kept my voice calm. Explained it multiple ways.

But I could feel it underneath. The subtle "how are you not getting this?" The barely-hidden frustration. The sense that I was being generous with my patience, that they should be grateful.

They got defensive. Started explaining why their approach actually made sense, why I was missing something. Got more entrenched in their position.

And I thought: "See? They're being stubborn. I'm trying to help and they won't listen."

But they sensed what I barely sensed myself. The looking-down beneath my patience. And that's what they were responding to. Not my words—my hidden positioning.

I made them worse while feeling like I was helping. And used their worseness as proof they were the problem.

I did this while genuinely convinced I was being helpful.

---

## The Recognition

Some part of you knew how to make them sense your malice while hiding it from yourself. Knew you'd both know what was happening. Knew neither could prove it.

And it executed on this vision while convincing you that you were helping.

And none of the things I pointed out are new information to you. You only recognize them because you _already knew about them_. They were just hidden in limbo.

Which means that part of you already knew that this mechanism was operating in you.

But wait.

The limbo state isn't some unconscious process beyond your control. It's not a mechanism that happens TO you.

It's YOU. Knowing something while hiding that knowledge from your conscious awareness.

Which means:

YOU knew how to make them sense your malice while hiding it from yourself. YOU knew you'd both know what was happening. YOU knew neither could prove it.

And YOU executed on this vision while convincing yourself that you were helping.

How do I—a complete stranger—know this about you?

---

Think back. Have you ever corrected someone—maybe even firmly—while genuinely giving them the benefit of the doubt? Not writing them off, not seeing them as fundamentally defective, but addressing their behavior while still seeing them as... reachable?

It felt different, didn't it? You didn't need the limbo state. There was nothing to hide from yourself. You weren't positioning yourself as better—you were serving something else. Something higher than proving your superiority.

And it had a different effect. Even if they didn't like being corrected, something in them could tell you weren't coming from contempt. The correction might have landed. Or at least it didn't make them worse.

Now think about being on the receiving end of that. Someone corrected you, but you could tell—beneath their words, independently of their words—that they weren't looking down on you. They were genuinely trying to help. Not to prove their superiority. Not to make you feel small.

Even if you didn't want to hear it, even if you resisted, you could sense the difference.

You already know how to tell. You've always known.

So why is it so hard to stay connected to that? Why do we keep slipping into the other thing—the contempt, the superiority, the looking-down—even when we've seen that it makes everything worse?

That's what I saw the answer to. Not in words—in a way that bypassed language entirely. And I've been trying ever since to reconstruct it in a form that might actually communicate it.

The medicine didn't give me new information. It brought old information out of limbo—the same way I'm trying to do for you now.

All at once. With a force that left no room for the usual defenses.

It wasn't revelation. It was recognition. And that recognition changed everything.

---

Everyone I know does this.

Not "everyone has flaws." This specific pattern. The same hiding. The same transmission. The same three strikes. The same result.

Think about someone you know. Different personality, different background. Now think about a time they felt contempt for someone.

They did the exact same thing you just did, didn't they?

We all just know how to do it.

---

This isn't some subtle insight. This isn't advanced psychology. Every single person knows what contempt feels like to receive. Every single person knows it makes you defensive. Every single person has seen someone get more entrenched when mocked.

This is completely, utterly obvious.

So why is nobody talking about it? 

Why has no one named this clearly? 

How have we all gone our whole lives doing this without someone pointing it out?
