# Part II: The Spreading

Think about the person you mocked. After your contempt darkened their world, after they became more defensive, more self-deceived...

Were they more likely to be kind to their family that night? Or less?

More patient with their kids? Or less?

More generous with strangers? Or less?

Your contempt didn't just affect them directly. It spread. To everyone they encountered. To their family, their coworkers, the cashier at the store.

Each person got a little less. A little more darkness in their day. And they, in turn, were a little more likely to spread it to others.

One moment of your contempt, spreading outward in ripples.

---

And what about your allies? The friends you recruited to join your contempt?

Did sharing that mockery make them kinder to others? Or did it give them permission to spread more contempt themselves?

Did it make them more likely to give people the benefit of the doubt? Or more likely to write people off?

You coordinated a collective darkening. Not just of your target, but of everyone in the network.

Each person you recruited carried it forward. Mentioned it to others. Looked at certain types of people differently. Became slightly colder, slightly more ready to judge.

And those people spread it further.

The ripples keep going. Each interaction slightly darker. Each person slightly more defensive, more self-deceived, more likely to spread it themselves.

Maybe it dilutes as it travels—each transmission weaker than the last. But it spreads so broadly that the total darkness moving through the network is staggering.

Your single moment of contempt, now carried by hundreds of people. Affecting thousands of interactions. Darkening minds you'll never meet, in places you'll never go.

---

You wanted them to be fundamentally defective. Because if they weren't—if your contempt was actually making them worse—then you'd have to stop. You'd have to face what you were doing.

So you made them worse. And then used their worseness as proof they deserved it.

---

But maybe you're thinking: "Okay, but that's just when I mock people. My actual work—my ideologies, my projects—those are different. Those are genuinely trying to make things better."

Are they?

---

But here's what I saw that completely changed everything:

You're not darkening their minds despite what it does to you.

You're darkening their minds BECAUSE of what it does to you.

---

The medicine showed me something I wasn't ready for: I'm in limbo way more often than I think.

Not just when I'm mocking people. Not just in obvious moments of contempt or cruelty.

Almost constantly. About almost everything.

Even in the casual phrases I use. "Play stupid games, win stupid prizes." "Fuck around and find out." "Darwin Award!" when someone dies in an easily-preventable way.

There's satisfaction beneath those words. A little hit of righteous contempt. Each one making it easier, more automatic, more necessary.

I wasn't mocking anyone directly. But I was maintaining the mechanism. Keeping it warmed up. Ready.

---

I tell myself I'm environmentally conscious. I care about the planet. But I drive more than I need to. Take trips I could avoid. Make choices I know contribute to the problem.

Part of me knows this. Knows I could choose differently.

But I hide that knowing from myself. Because if I faced it fully, I'd have to change. And I don't want to change.

So I keep it in limbo.

---

I tell myself I'm against corporate greed. That I want a more just economy. But I make financial decisions—investments, purchases, behaviors—that feed exactly the system I claim to oppose.

Part of me knows this. Knows I'm complicit.

But I hide it. Because facing it would require... what? Sacrifice? Discomfort? Actually changing rather than just having the right opinions?

So I keep it in limbo.

---

I tell myself I care about people. That I want to help. But I walk past suffering I could address. Ignore problems I could engage with. Maintain comforts I know come at others' expense.

Part of me knows this. Knows what I'm avoiding.

But I hide it. Because the knowing would be unbearable.

So I keep it in limbo.

---

I tell myself I'm a good friend. That I show up for people. But there's someone I haven't called back in weeks. Someone going through something hard. Someone I keep meaning to reach out to.

Part of me knows I'm avoiding it. Knows they probably need support. Knows I could just send a text.

But I hide that knowing. Because reaching out would be uncomfortable. Would require emotional labor. Would interfere with my comfort.

So I keep it in limbo. Tell myself I'll do it tomorrow. That they probably have other support. That one more day won't matter.

---

The medicine brought all of this out at once. Every piece of hidden knowing. Every place I was lying to myself while pretending I wasn't.

It was crushing.

But here's what made it unbearable: I already knew all of this.

Not in some vague, theoretical way. I knew it the same way you knew everything in Part I—it was just hidden in limbo. The medicine didn't tell me anything. It just brought what I already knew out of hiding. All at once. With no room left for the usual defenses.

And what's strange—what I'm still trying to understand—is that the medicine wasn't judging me. It wasn't contemptuous. It wasn't trying to make me feel bad.

It was just... showing me. Holding up a mirror. Refusing to let me look away.

And somehow, that worked. The seeing itself—without judgment, without contempt, just clear and unavoidable—made it impossible to keep doing it. Made it impossible to stay in limbo.

There was something about being seen completely—my darkness, my self-deception, my participation in spreading it—without being judged for it. Without being made to feel fundamentally defective.

The medicine held my feet to the fire. But it didn't burn me. It just wouldn't let me hide.

And in that space—seen completely but not condemned—something shifted.

But I'm getting ahead of myself.

First, I had to see how far it went.

---

That oil executive I have contempt for? The one making decisions that harm the planet?

My contempt for them isn't just spreading darkness to them (though it does that). It's serving a function for me.

Because as long as they're the problem—as long as they're the evil ones, the greedy ones, the ones destroying the planet—I don't have to look at my own choices.

I can drive more than I need to because it's really their fault, isn't it? They're the ones keeping us dependent on fossil fuels. They're the ones making the destructive decisions. If they would just change, we wouldn't have this problem.

My contempt for them lets me stay in limbo about my own behavior.

---

But here's what made my blood run cold:

That contempt doesn't stay in my head. It travels. Through conversations. Through the culture. Through the coalition of people who share my judgment.

Eventually reaching people like that executive as... something. Not as a specific message about environmentalists. But as ambient darkness. The world feeling slightly more hostile. People caring slightly less. Nature mattering slightly less. All of it justifying their own self-serving choices.

Which makes them more defensive. More entrenched in their position. Less likely to listen to criticism. Less likely to change. To care about the planet I was supposedly trying to protect.

Which I then use as proof they're fundamentally bad. "See? They don't care. They're just greedy."

Which justifies my contempt. Which lets me stay in limbo about my own choices. Which darkens them more.

---

But it's worse than that.

My hidden behavior—the driving I won't acknowledge, the consumption I won't face—contributes to the very problem the executive is managing badly.

I'm creating more demand for fossil fuels. While judging the person supplying them. While refusing to see my role in the system.

But here's what I saw that was truly disturbing:

When I'm in limbo, people sense it. I don't know how. But they do.

The same way the person you mocked sensed your hidden malice. The same way you sensed the stranger's contempt.

People around me sensed my self-deception. My friends don't consciously notice. But something in them registers the falseness. The incongruence between what I claim to value and what I actually do.

And that sensing darkens them.

Not "he's a hypocrite about driving." But something deeper: "People don't actually believe the things they say. Everyone's performing. Nothing's real."

My limbo—my self-deception about my own behavior—spreads as cynicism. As permission to not take their own values seriously. As a sense that caring deeply about anything is naive.

And their limbo spreads further. Each person slightly more cynical. Slightly more convinced that everyone's just going through the motions.

Eventually reaching people like that executive as... what? Not cynicism about environmentalists specifically. Just darkness. The world feeling colder. Life mattering less. People mattering less. A subtle permission to care less about everything—including the consequences of their decisions.

Which makes them more defensive. More entrenched. Less likely to change.

And my contempt for how they manage the problem makes them manage it worse. Their worse management gives me more reason for contempt. Which lets me hide my behavior more easily.

We're locked in a cycle. My darkness depends on theirs. Theirs depends on mine.

I need them to be evil so I can stay in limbo.

---

◊

And then the medicine showed me something that made everything shift.

I was seeing this whole pattern—my self-deception, my contempt, the spreading, the cycles—and thinking about how I was using it. How it served me. Let me avoid discomfort. Let me maintain my self-image while keeping my comforts.

And then, suddenly, a question:

*But am I benefiting?*

My world is getting shittier. The executive is more entrenched. The problem I claim to care about is getting worse. My relationships are infected with cynicism. The people around me are darker, more defended, more closed off.

I'm making everything worse. Including for myself.

*So who's benefiting?*

And then I saw it.

*The self-deception itself.*

It doesn't care if it's in my mind or yours. Doesn't care if it's about driving or money or relationships or politics. It just wants to spread. To replicate. To strengthen itself. To hide itself better.

I'm not using self-deception.

*It's using me.*

Using me to propagate itself. To infect others. To create the exact conditions where it flourishes—a world where everyone's in limbo, where cynicism is normal, where nobody takes their values seriously, where everyone's just performing.

Each time I stay in limbo, I'm feeding it. Making it stronger. Helping it spread.

*The mechanism isn't mine. I'm its vehicle. Its host.*

And everyone else is too. All of us spreading it to each other. All of us keeping it alive. All of us serving something that's using us while we think we're serving ourselves.

---

Again, notice that I'm not showing you anything new. Part of you already knew all this—and not unconsciously, either. All the pieces were there for you to put together. So why didn't you?

Why aren't we all talking about it? Why isn't it the ONLY thing we're talking about?

What part of us—or what part of our entire civilization—would benefit from not seeing this?

From keeping it in limbo?

---

Think about someone working on the factory floor of an industrial farm. Not the CEO—just someone doing their job.

Part of them knows. Has to know. You can't be around that much suffering without knowing something is wrong.

But they have a family to feed. Bills to pay. Limited options.

So they keep that knowing in limbo. Tell themselves the animals don't really suffer. That this is just how it works. That if they quit, someone else would take their place.

The limbo state isn't a personal failing. It's a requirement of the job. The system selects for people who can maintain it.

---

The operations manager who optimized it. The executive who scaled it. They know too.

But acknowledging it would require dismantling their career. Admitting their life's work caused immense suffering. Facing something unbearable.

So they hide it. And the hiding becomes automatic. Necessary. Part of how they function.

---

The system doesn't need anyone to be a monster. It just needs people who can maintain limbo. Who can know and not-know simultaneously.

And it's sophisticated. It provides justifications that sound reasonable. Frames cruelty as necessity. Surrounds you with others who maintain the same limbo, so it feels normal.

---

Can you feel how your contempt for these people serves the same function?

Your contempt for the factory farmer lets you stay in limbo about eating factory-farmed meat. Your contempt for the oil executive lets you stay in limbo about your consumption.

The contempt isn't separate from the systems. It's how the systems maintain themselves. By keeping everyone in limbo. By making sure nobody can see the whole pattern.

It's not you doing this. It's not them doing this.

It's using all of us. Using our goodness—our genuine desire to stop harm—as the mechanism for its own propagation.

---

◊

The medicine wasn't done.

It started showing me the actual work I was doing. Not my consumption. Not my casual cruelty. The projects. The things I was most proud of.

---

That software project I'd been building for years. To help people. I genuinely cared about making their lives better--I could feel that care, real and true.

But watching it now, I saw something else woven through every decision.

I also wanted recognition. Wanted to be the person who built something important. Wanted to prove I was sophisticated, capable, worth paying attention to.

And I couldn't admit that second part to myself. Because it would make me look bad. Feel bad. So I kept it in limbo.

Which meant it infected every decision without me seeing it.

When I chose the elegant solution over the simple one? I told myself: "This is better engineering. More maintainable long-term."

But really? I wanted to show off my sophistication. Wanted other engineers to see how clever I was.

When users struggled with my interface? I told myself: "They're not thinking hard enough. They need to learn how it works."

But really? I didn't want to compromise MY vision for THEIR needs. Their confusion was proof of my sophistication, not my failure.

When teammates raised concerns about potential harm? I told myself: "They're not seeing the bigger picture. They're being short-sighted."

But really? I didn't want my project slowed down. Didn't want to face that maybe I was wrong.

Every choice was justifiable. Every choice had good reasoning. My mind had designed it that way--so the real motive stayed hidden from me, even when pressed. There was always an escape hatch. Always plausible deniability.

The tiny biases in each decision compounded into real harm. Users frustrated, struggling, giving up. Team members dismissed, their concerns unheard. Potential harms ignored because acknowledging them would interfere with my timeline, my vision, my proof of worth.

And here's what made me want to throw up:

Part of me had always known this. Had ALWAYS known what I was really doing and why. I'd been maintaining the pretense to myself--successfully--for years.

The genuine care was real. But it was infected with something I couldn't admit. And that infection biased everything while I told myself I was just being rigorous, just maintaining standards, just thinking clearly.

◊

And then it showed me how this operated in completely different forms. Not just hidden vanity. Different structures entirely.

When I cut someone off in traffic, I had a reason. I was running late--had a good reason for being late. My situation was genuinely different.

When they cut me off? No excuse. Just selfishness. Carelessness. Bad driving.

Same action. Completely different explanations. And I kept both explanations ready without ever noticing the contradiction.

Part of me had always known this was bullshit. That I was holding different standards. That my "good reasons" were just ego protection.

But I kept it hidden. Because seeing it would mean I'm not special. That the rules apply to me too. That I'm just as flawed as everyone else.

◊

I'd share articles about corporate emissions. "Corporations cause 71% of global emissions." True fact. Important fact.

But part of me was using that truth to hide something uglier.

The truth let me excuse my own behavior. Let me degrade the sense of collective responsibility. Let me position corporations as THE problem so I didn't have to be part of ANY problem.

And part of me knew this would have that effect. Part of me WANTED that effect.

The truth was the weapon. The lie was what I did with it. And I kept that purpose hidden--from others, from myself.

◊

In my activism work, I'd confront people. Point out how their actions harmed others. And I was RIGHT--their actions DID cause harm.

But I didn't confront them to help them see. Not really.

I confronted them in a way DESIGNED to make them defensive. To make them dig in. Part of me knew exactly what tone, what words, what framing would make them resist.

Because if they actually changed? If they genuinely heard me and improved?

Then I'd lose my proof they were bad. I'd lose my justification for contempt. I'd lose my identity as one of the good ones fighting the bad ones.

I needed them to stay bad. So I confronted them in ways that ensured they would.

Because to actually reach them, I'd have to see them as reachable. As confused rather than defective. As capable of change rather than fixed in their nature. And if I let myself see them that way—as confused, but reachable—I couldn't maintain my contempt. The contempt required flattening them. Reducing them to their worst behavior. Treating that behavior as what they fundamentally were rather than what they were doing while lost.

And part of me had always known this. Always known I was sabotaging the very change I claimed to want.

◊

Online, I'd see someone saying something wrong. Harmful misinformation. And I'd correct them--publicly, sharply, with just enough snark to get upvotes.

I told myself: "I'm correcting dangerous misinformation. This is important."

But really? I wanted the hit. The Reddit karma. The Twitter likes. The feeling of being smarter, more informed, on the right side.

The correction was real. The misinformation was real. But my motive infected how I did it.

I didn't engage to help them understand. I engaged to dunk on them. To signal my superiority to the audience. To get validation.

And the dunk made them more defensive. More entrenched. Less likely to actually learn.

Which was fine. Better, even. Because I got my validation and they stayed wrong, giving me more opportunities for future dunks.

Part of me had always known I wasn't helping. Was making the misinformation problem WORSE by turning corrections into status competitions.

But I kept that knowing hidden. Because admitting it would mean giving up the hit.

◊

The medicine kept going. Showing me form after form after form.

My political beliefs--genuinely held AND a vehicle for feeling superior.

My environmentalism--genuinely caring about the planet AND wanting enemies to feel righteous against.

My compassion--genuinely wanting to help AND wanting to be seen as compassionate.

My teaching--genuinely trying to share knowledge AND needing to be the smart one.

My relationships--genuinely loving people AND using them to meet my needs.

My self-improvement--genuinely wanting to grow AND wanting to feel like I was better than my past self, better than people who weren't "working on themselves."

Every single thing. At every level. In every domain. Infected with dual motives I couldn't admit.

And the sophisticated design--the escape hatches, the justifications, the plausible deniability--that was the mechanism. That's how it stayed hidden. That's how I could maintain the pretense even to myself.

◊

But here's what broke me completely.

I could see self-deception so clearly in other people.

Their hidden motives. Their bullshit justifications. Their sophisticated escape hatches. The way they'd twist logic to avoid seeing what they were doing.

I was perceptive. Insightful. Sharp.

And I used that clarity as proof I wasn't doing it myself.

The logic seemed airtight: "If I were self-deceived, I'd see it--I'm perceptive, look how clearly I see THEM doing it. The fact that I don't see it in myself means it's not there."

I'd watch someone rationalize their behavior and think: "They can't even see what they're doing. How do people live like this?"

While doing the exact same thing. The whole time.

◊

Watching the trip unfold, I saw it. The same mechanism. Operating in me. In countless forms. Constantly.

And the horror wasn't discovering something new.

It was recognizing something I'd ALWAYS known but successfully hidden from myself.

Part of me had always known I was doing this. The whole time. Years. Decades. While I saw it so clearly in others. While I used seeing it in them as proof I wasn't doing it.

I'd been maintaining the pretense to myself--successfully--while part of me knew exactly what I was doing.

◊

I'm a hypocrite.

I saw their self-deception so clearly and used it as proof I wasn't self-deceived.

While being self-deceived the whole time.

While feeling superior for not being a hypocrite.

That's what I am.

◊

And I couldn't think my way out. Every attempt to monitor myself, to check my motives, to be more aware--those were just new forms of the same mechanism. New escape hatches. New ways to maintain the pretense while feeling like I was being rigorous.

The self-deception was DESIGNED to defeat monitoring and calculation. That was the whole point. My thinking wasn't the solution--it was the tool the mechanism used to hide itself.

◊


But then the medicine showed me something else.

That teacher. After I'd done something genuinely shitty--cruel to another student, destructive, way out of line. She pulled me aside. And she was fierce. Direct. Didn't let me off the hook.

But there was something underneath her fierceness. Something I couldn't name but could feel.

She was angry at what I'd done. But she hadn't written me off. She was correcting me TOWARD something, not just punishing me for being defective.

She refused to give up on me. Even in her anger. Even in her disappointment.

It wasn't in her words. It was beneath them. In how she held herself. In what she expected from me. She was treating me like someone who could be better. Like the behavior was foreign to my nature, not proof of it.

And somehow, in that moment, I wanted to be who she saw. Not to please her. Not to avoid punishment. Just... because that's who I actually was underneath the bullshit.

The correction landed. I actually changed. Not from fear. Not from guilt. From something else.

◊

And I'd HAD moments like that. Times I corrected someone that way. Firmly, even fiercely, but without contempt. Without writing them off. Seeing them as confused, not defective. Refusing to forsake them even while confronting their harm.

And I could feel the difference. In those moments, I wasn't calculating. Wasn't justifying. Wasn't maintaining some image of myself as good.

Just... fierce integrity. Like I knew what mattered and couldn't betray it, even to spare their feelings or protect myself. Clarity about what was right, combined with an absolute refusal to give up on them.

I couldn't explain it. Couldn't justify it. Couldn't monitor for it.

But I knew--absolutely knew--those moments were different.

*In exactly the way the medicine was doing for me right now.*

◊

So that's the distinction.

Not good actions versus bad actions. Not compassion versus cruelty. Not helping versus harming.

But where the action came from.

The contaminated moments--even the "good" ones--came from a place that needed justification. Needed to feel superior. Needed to prove something. Needed permission.

Those other moments came from fierce integrity. From refusing to forsake--myself, the other person, what was right. No calculation. No justification. No dual motives hiding in limbo.

Just clarity about what mattered, combined with an absolute refusal to abandon it.

But what WAS that? How had I lost contact with it so completely? How had we all?

I needed to understand.

The mushrooms weren't done showing me.
