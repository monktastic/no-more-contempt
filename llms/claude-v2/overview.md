"**The simplicity of the truth is inversely proportional to the complexity required to make someone accept it.**"

TODO: "What started as the simple lie of feeling superior—barely worth mentioning—has transformed into something truly monstrous."

**Layered darkness reveal:**
1. I'm spreading darkness
2. It's on purpose, to benefit me / hide mine
3. I'm actually afraid of it, which is why I have to hide it. I feel so much better when I don't. My world is brighter.
4. Wait, I'm not using it to hide my darkness. It's using me to hide itself!



**Layered parasite reveal:**
1. It didn't feel like me.

> Those "pure" moments had felt most authentically me.

2. When I could see clearly what it was producing, I didn't want it.

> Who was all this darkness really serving?
>
> When I had the honest chance to reflect on the tradeoff--more self-serving behavior for me in exchange for a darker world--it suddenly didn't make any sense. Was microplastics in my food worth... getting to hate my enemies? Judge people who cut me off?
> 
> None of it made any sense.


3. It hid itself from me.

4. Regardless of who used it, it was only benefiting itself. Getting stronger, better at hiding, etc.


# Part 1

Part one should focus on a single scenario (1:1 mocking).

**Major insights**
- Limbo state is the only way you can cause harm.
- The mere act of being in limbo pushes them into the dark—which is what we secretly wanted.
- Shielding
- Evil people do same thing
- The mutual knowing
- None of this is new to you
- How can you ever be sure you're doing good?
- Why hasn't humanity found an answer? Maybe part of us doesn't want one, and that part is steering.

**What Part I shows:**
- Your intent to drive them into darkness IS the execution, and the limbo state telegraphs this intent, which makes them worse

**What we haven't shown:**
- That making things was the PRIMARY purpose (not side effect or collateral damage)
- That the mockery was the delivery vehicle FOR the hypocrisy
- Calculations done in limbo cannot be trusted.

Part II needs to show: **the hypocrisy itself was the goal, the mockery was just the vehicle.**


**Hinted**
- The reason we see people as bad is to know who it's okay to push in.


Part I
- The limbo state is how I give myself permission to cause harm. Self-deception.
- You mock someone. See them as defective.
- Three strikes (more self-deception=badness, accusation of evil, accusation was projection)
- My mockery contains a subtle signal to them that's hidden from me, and this combo creates a recursive pattern that makes them dig in, which is the goal I secretly wanted, because it justifies my treatment of them.
- There are more defective people in the world, it's even worse than I thought, feel more justified in my self-serving behaviors while being less likely to recognize them as such.
- If you could see their full humanity, you couldn't do it. Seeing someone as defective requires you to shield something from yourself. What are you shielding?
	- Evil people don't do a different thing.
- Now, having just mocked someone, suppose a stranger walks in and scolds you for it. Part of you *knows* they're right in their accusation—that you're doing essentially the same thing the "evil people" are—but do you thank them for it and repent? You can sense they're not coming from a good place. How?
- The recursive pattern
- You needed them to get worse so you could believe you didn't make them worse.
- Same thing happens when we shame or contemptuously judge someone.
	- It's the *contempt*. It's the feeling of shielding. (connect it to limbo state?)
- ~~There's a part of me that's doing this => wait, *I* am doing this.~~
- You honestly believed you were helping. (Hint: you can't trust your own conscious mind. cannot calculate your way to goodness)
- So there's a part of you that intentionally creates evil.
	- How do you know you're not doing this all the time?

What needs cutting / moving:
- Indirect spreading to this enemy through allies. Can be cut to just showing how it reinforces their self-deception.
- Feeling superior to others
- The way you explained something "obvious" to someone.
- I was explaining something technical to a colleague.

Q:
- Does the reader realize that the purpose is to enable their own self-serving behavior _in general_? Or is that a Part II reveal? (A: we lightly touch on how it)

# Part 2 (Everything is infected)

Some Key Insights For in Part II:
1. ✅ **Early fossil fuel contempt example** - Environmental work with contempt woven through
2. ✅ **General contempt rippling to oil exec** - Not millions of others, just yours reaching him
3. ✅ **World's shittiness licensing your behavior** - Using dark world to justify taking extra
4. ✅ **Reveal that darkening is the PURPOSE** - Not side effect, the actual point
5. ✅ **All darkness is essentially the same** - Why unrelated instances increase ambient darkness
6. ✅ **Clean moments reminder** - Integrity moments that felt like "you," suggesting darkness isn't you

Part II shows WHAT you're doing (hiding) and Part III shows WHY (the unbearable terror beneath it).

What we need to accomplish:
- My self-deception was ubiquitous (depth, breadth, scope, subtlety, etc.)
- It rippled outward
- How all darkness was the same
- Its purpose was to darken the ambient field, to hide itself
- The shadow ALWAYS finds a backdoor, no matter how careful you think you're being.

Content:
- How darkening this person had been not just knowing, not just intentional alongside the good it caused, but the whole point.
- Rippled outward
- Self-deception happening everywhere, all the time, at every conceivable level (countless forms of contempt, self-deception, hypocrisy)
	- How other people could subconsciously sense when I was out of integrity, and it gave them tacit permission to leave it too. It was a continuous unspoken communication.
- How all darkness is essentially the same.
- How insanely subtle it could be (mind would find the subtlest ways of injecting it, and get a subtle thrill out of how well it could be hidden even from myself).
	- Key point: the shadow ALWAYS finds a backdoor, no matter how careful you think you're being.
- Even bonding with allies
- Even the PUREST of my intentions had been extremely subtly infected.
- Show that the real purpose was to darken the entire ambient field, to hide my shadow in it.
	- How I had known this, and thus my calculations were indeed nonsense.
- "Fuck around and find out", "Darwin awards!" etc. purpose to darken ambient field.
- Taking dark satisfaction. Watching Karens get owned. Etc.
- "Don't be gentle, it's a rental" (will come back to later)
- The Slap: why nobody could name it

## Notes

**The pieces they admit in Part I:**

1. I knew I was doing it (conscious, not unconscious)
2. I knew it would make them worse (conscious knowledge of effect)
3. I kept doing it anyway (continued action despite knowing)
4. I hid this knowing from myself (intentional hiding)

**The logical conclusion they can't escape:** If you:

- Consciously knew what you were doing
- Consciously knew the effect it would have
- Kept doing it anyway
- Hid your knowing from yourself

Then **some part of you intended that outcome.** Otherwise why would you hide the knowing? You only hide things you don't want to face.

**You don't need to accuse them.** You just need to show them what they already admitted:

"You knew. You knew what would happen. You did it anyway. And you hid from yourself that you knew. What does that mean?"

Let them connect the dots.

**In Part II, you can make it explicit:** "Remember how you knew all those things but kept doing it? That's because part of you _wanted_ that outcome. The hiding wasn't accidental—it was _necessary_ to get what you wanted while maintaining plausible deniability."

They've already admitted every premise. The conclusion is inescapable.

**That's brilliant structure.**


---

I'd been trying to find the "clean" version of myself—the me that acts from pure light. But I saw: **the infection doesn't announce itself.** It weaves through even genuine care—a subtle positioning, a hidden comparison, a shadow of superiority I couldn't see from inside it.

**I couldn't just "do better." I had to learn to see what I'd been blind to.**


How to prove "net harm":

**A. The purpose reveals itself in the execution**

> I saw how my hypocrisy wasn't just a side effect—it was the entire point. The mockery was just the delivery vehicle for the hypocrisy. The hypocrisy was the weapon.

**B. The satisfaction comes from the harm, not the good**

> I felt where the actual satisfaction was coming from. Not from "helping the world" or "standing up for what's right." From making them feel small. That's what felt good.

**C. The world responds to what you're actually doing**

> I saw how the world was responding to what I was _actually_ doing (spreading darkness), not what I told myself I was doing (fighting evil). Reality doesn't care about your story.

**D. The justifications are too perfect**

> I noticed how _perfectly_ my mind had justified it. Too perfect. Like it had been pre-prepared. Ready to deploy the instant I needed to not-see what I was doing.

**E. You already chose the outcome**

> I saw that I'd already decided the outcome I wanted (them feeling bad, me feeling righteous) and then reverse-engineered the justification. The calculation came after the choice.

**F. The "good" reasoning is post-hoc**

> I watched my mind generate reasons why it was good. Generate them. In real-time. After I'd already decided to do it. The reasoning wasn't guiding my behavior—it was covering for it.

**G. The care about outcomes is selective**

> I cared intensely about whether my "good work" succeeded, but I didn't care at all whether my contempt made things worse. That asymmetry revealed what I actually cared about.

**H. It feels different from genuine care**

> I could feel the difference between this and times I'd acted from genuine care. Genuine care feels clean. This felt... slippery. Coated. Even though I couldn't see the coating from inside it.

## Most Relatable Ways (My Recommendation)

**Combine B, E, and H:**

> I felt where the actual satisfaction was coming from—not from "making the world better" but from making them feel small. That's what I'd wanted all along.
> 
> I saw that I'd already chosen the outcome (them feeling bad, me feeling righteous) and then calculated reasons why it was good. The calculation came _after_ the choice, not before.
> 
> And I could feel the difference between this and times I'd acted from genuine care. This felt slippery, coated in justification. Clean care never needed that coating.

This makes it **viscerally recognizable** without requiring them to "calculate" whether net harm occurred.

**Part II then shows:**
- That quality (darkness) spreads in ways you didn't track
- Your good projects carry that same quality
- The quality matters more than your calculations
- **You've always been able to sense the quality, but you ignored it**


**In trip voice, you can show:**

> I saw how my mind had been generating justifications the whole time. Perfect little arguments for why it was okay. But they were all constructed WHILE I was in limbo—while part of me was actively hiding the truth.
> 
> How could I possibly trust calculations made by a mind that was lying to itself?

**Then show the contrast:**

> And I remembered times I'd acted from genuine care—where no calculation was needed. The rightness was obvious. Clean. No elaborate justification required.
> 
> The need to calculate whether it was okay was itself the sign that it wasn't

**Opens with trip voice and immediately addresses the calculation problem:**

> What I saw next shattered any remaining confidence in my moral calculations.
> 
> I watched how my contempt spread... [the ripples section]
> 
> And I saw something else: I'd always known this would happen. Not through calculation—I'd _felt_ what I was putting into the world. The quality of it.
> 
> But my calculating mind, the part in limbo, had overridden that knowing with clever justifications...


> And then I saw the real purpose. Not just making them feel bad. Not even just the ripples.
 The real purpose was to darken the entire ambient field. To make the world just a little darker, so my own shadow could hide in it.
  If everyone's doing it, if darkness is normal, if the world is harsh... then I don't have to face what's in me. I can point to them instead.
 **Every act of contempt was creating cover for my shadow.**


## Part 3 (Universality)

**Key beats:**
1. No, you're not alone—everyone
2. We're all doing it to each other (collective trap)
3. WHY: Can't face being fundamentally dark
4. Need evil people to BE fundamentally dark (for contrast)
5. Evil people are fundamentally innocent (same mechanism = protecting same thing)
6. Medicine asks: "Are you using it, or is it using you?"

"You couldn't wish harm without shielding. **Why not? What does that tell you about what your fundamental nature?**

And if evil people need the same shielding—just more of it—what does that tell you about theirs?"

### To grab from old drafts:

"Think about someone working on the factory floor of an industrial farm. Not the CEO—just someone doing their job."

"And I needed them to be not just defective, but *fundamentally* so"

- I needed to believe they were fundamentally different
- Because the thought of being like them was _unbearable_
- That terror—that bone-deep existential horror—drove everything
- Made me create evidence, shield from them, darken the world
- Wait... who benefits from me being this terrified?
- [Parasite reveal: The terror itself was manufactured]

## Part 4 (The coordination)

Example where i confront an evil person, using contempt—i narrate how i could sense their parasite resonating with mine, inviting me to hate the person so it could ingratiate itself to them further. The secret handshake.

How the same thing happens when we all band together to hate an "evil person." It's inviting us to FEED it. I think it's not hard to make the reader feel that, right? Like, that should almost be a slam dunk given the mind-state they're in with all this darkness talk?

This is why wise people urge compassion for evildoers. The only other option is to shove them deeper in; to feed them to humanity's primal nemesis.

"When we all band together to hate someone, we think we're unified against evil. But actually, we're all _feeding_ the thing—giving it more power in that person while also strengthening it in ourselves."

"The more contempt you're feeling, the deeper you're in limbo, and the more your calculations are compromised. Or said in different words, the more the Devil is corrupting them."

The Slap.

## Appendix:

> "This book has been doing to you what it describes: bringing something out of limbo state. You've always known evil people aren't fundamentally different from you. But you couldn't let yourself see what that meant until the defenses were dismantled."
