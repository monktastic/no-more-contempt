# Part III: Why We Do This

---

The mushrooms weren't letting me go.

They showed me something I'd been hiding from myself. Something so threatening I couldn't bring it into conscious awareness.

Why? Why work so hard to hide it?

And then I saw it.

---

Every bone in my body NEEDED to believe the world's problems were caused by something fundamentally alien to me. A defectiveness that only lived in them. Never in me.

If my misdeeds were the same nature as theirs--if we were doing the same thing--then I couldn't be one of the good ones anymore.

The implications were unbearable.

It would mean that when I see someone causing real harm--the oil executive, the corrupt politician, the abusive parent--I'm not seeing something foreign. I'm seeing a more complete version of what's already in me.

It would mean that my contempt for them isn't righteous opposition. It's a way to avoid looking at my own participation in the same pattern.

It would mean that the line I drew--between people who deserve compassion and people who deserve contempt--isn't a moral distinction. It's a psychological defense. A way to maintain the illusion that evil lives only OUT THERE.

It would mean I'm not fighting evil. I'm hiding from it. In myself.

And if THAT'S true--if I'm not fundamentally different from them--then what does that make me?

What does that make all my righteous crusades? All my contempt? All my certainty that I was one of the good ones?

I'd have to look at what was inside me.

And I'd rather die than do that.

So I had to hide it. At any cost.

---

But wait.

That line I drew. The line between people who deserved my compassion and people who deserved my contempt.

I didn't draw it to PROTECT good people.

I drew it specifically to have people I could perpetrate this ruse against.

There was something inside me. I couldn't name it yet, but I could feel it--something that wasn't quite me. Something USING me. Operating through me while keeping itself hidden from my awareness.

I started calling it a parasite.

It knew it couldn't just hurt good people. That would be too obviously wrong. I'd see it. I'd stop.

So it made me draw a line. Made me create a category of people who were DIFFERENT. Who DESERVED it. Who I could darken without feeling bad.

The line was never about morality.

It was only ever a way for this thing to keep its foot in the door of my mind. To have a place to FEED while keeping me convinced I was good.

Oh fuck. Oh FUCK.

---

And not just hide it--I had to PROVE they were fundamentally defective.

Had to make them worse. More defensive. More unreachable.

Because the worse they got, the more different they seemed. The more justified my contempt. The safer my identity.

I was running a fiendish ruse. Making them worse so I could believe I wasn't making them worse.

And hiding it so perfectly from myself that I had to bury it even deeper. Which made me do it harder. Which made them worse. Which proved they were defective.

A vicious feedback loop. Accelerating.

---

And here's what made it worse:

Every time I felt contempt, something strange happened.

I didn't feel LESS justified. I felt MORE justified.

The three strikes made me MORE certain they were defective. MORE certain I was right. MORE licensed to feel contempt.

It was self-reinforcing. Getting stronger. More automatic. More necessary.

My parasite was learning. Getting better at hiding itself from me.

---

And then I saw something that made my stomach drop.

I wasn't just seeing their self-deception clearly despite my own.

I was seeing it clearly BECAUSE of my own.

I needed to see them as fundamentally defective to avoid seeing myself.

My clarity about their darkness was in service of my blindness to mine.

The mechanism was making me feel MORE perceptive. MORE insightful. MORE awake.

While I was asleep the whole time.

Oh god. Oh god.

---

But wait.

When I pushed them deeper in--when my contempt made them worse--I took that as proof.

Proof they were defective. Proof this world sucks. Proof my self-serving agendas were justified after all.

I was getting DARKER. At the exact same moment they were.

---

And then the medicine showed me something that made everything invert.

My parasite wasn't attacking theirs.

They were COORDINATING.

---

Oh fuck. Oh FUCK.

We BOTH got worse. BOTH felt more righteous. BOTH became more certain the darkness lived only OUT THERE, not in us.

My parasite fed. Their parasite fed. Both at once.

Their parasite needed mine. Mine needed theirs.

They weren't fighting. They were in ALLIANCE.

A secret handshake beneath conscious awareness.

---

And they knew. They both knew.

My parasite knew it was using theirs. Theirs knew it was using mine.

They coordinated perfectly. Each making its host more convinced they were free of darkness. Each using the other as proof. Each feeding the other exactly what it needed.

I pushed them in. They got worse. Which proved to me they were defective. Which justified my self-deception. Which made me darker. Which fed my parasite.

They pushed me in. I got worse. Which proved to them I was defective. Which justified their self-deception. Which made them darker. Which fed their parasite.

We were both spreading it. Both hosts. Both vehicles.

Both absolutely convinced we were the ones fighting it.

Holy shit. HOLY SHIT.

---

But HOW was this working? What was the mechanism?

The medicine showed me.

---

Every time I mocked someone, contempted them, treated them as fundamentally defective--I stopped seeing their full humanity.

Normally, I have an aversion to harming people. Because I can sense something in them. Their innocence. Their confusion. The pain behind their eyes. Something that instinctively makes me recoil from causing harm.

But when I stop seeing that? When I flatten them into "just an asshole" or "just evil" or "just stupid"?

The guardrails come off.

I can do things to them I couldn't do if I saw their full humanity. Say things. Feel things. Spread darkness without flinching.

I started calling this "shielding"--cutting myself off from sensing what I'm really doing to them.

And they sense this. Not consciously. But something in them registers: "He's not seeing me as human."

Which darkens them. Makes them more defensive. More closed off. More likely to shield from MY humanity in return.

That's the handshake. That's how the parasites coordinate.

---

And here's what made it so insidious:

I could shield while maintaining I cared. While claiming I was fighting for justice. While insisting I saw them clearly.

The shielding was beneath all that. Operating in a place I couldn't monitor.

I'd convince myself I was being rigorous. Clear-eyed. Unflinching in facing hard truths.

But really? I was just giving myself permission to not see them fully. To flatten them into something less than human. To make them into acceptable targets.

And the moment I did that--the moment I stopped seeing their full humanity--I could spread darkness to them while feeling righteous about it.

While shaking hands with their parasite.

All while my parasite fed.

---

And then it got worse.

Because it wasn't just me and them.

It was everyone. EVERYONE.

---

The medicine showed me--I could see it now, spreading through networks like a contagion.

My contempt darkened someone. Their darkness darkened someone else. That person darkened another. Each person convinced THEY were justified. THEY were different. THEY were fighting evil.

While we were all doing the exact same thing.

Every single person I knew. Different personalities. Different backgrounds. Different politics.

All maintaining the same mechanism. All needing evil to be fundamentally alien. All needing certain people to be defective. All using contempt to create the evidence. All hiding it from themselves while part of them knew.

We were ALL doing this. For the same reason.

To keep our own parasites hidden from ourselves.

---

All making each other worse. All using each other. All shoving each other deeper to prove the darkness wasn't in us.

We weren't fighting each other.

Our parasites were COORDINATING. A massive distributed network. Each node feeding every other node. Each person convinced they were fighting while actually spreading it.

A secret alliance across the entire species.

I wanted to scream.

---

But the medicine wasn't done. It showed me how this operated at bigger scales.

◊◊◊

And then it showed me something that inverted everything I thought I knew about morality.

---

There was a TV show. A parent disciplined an unruly child by slapping him. Viewers split into camps:

"You shouldn't hit a child!" versus "Being weak causes this!"

They argued about discipline methods. About being too soft or too hard. About the nice-mean axis.

But I watched that scene, and part of me felt... satisfaction. A little hit of righteous vindication. "YEAH! Give it to that fucking kid!"

And then the medicine made me see it.

The parent didn't slap out of discipline. They slapped out of CONTEMPT. Out of seeing the child as fundamentally defective. Out of shielding from the child's confusion and pain.

And when I felt that satisfaction? I was ALSO shielding. Also seeing the child as defective. Also darkening alongside the parent.

The adult's contempt had made ME worse. Had darkened ME.

I'd shaken hands with their parasite.

Just like I'd done to others. My contempt making THEM worse. Darker. More defensive. Inviting them to shake hands with MY parasite.

---

And here's what made me want to throw up:

Everyone watching that scene missed the actual problem.

They argued about discipline. About being permissive versus strict. About how to raise children. About the appropriate use of force.

All of it completely beside the point.

The real issue--the contempt, the shielding, the secret handshake with the parasites--went completely unexamined.

---

Because the nice-mean axis wasn't the good-bad axis.

They're orthogonal. Completely different dimensions.

---

You could correct a child fiercely--even physically if necessary--while refusing to shield from their humanity. Seeing them as confused, not defective. Holding them accountable while refusing to forsake them.

That would be fierce AND kind.

Or you could be gentle, patient, "nice"--while shielding. While seeing them as defective underneath your patience. While spreading darkness through subtle contempt.

That would be nice AND cruel.

While quietly coordinating with their parasite.

---

I'd prided myself on that quote: *Be kind, for everyone you meet is fighting a great battle.*

Set it as my social media status. Quoted it to friends.

But I always interpreted it as: Be kind, for MOST people you meet... except for those fucking evil people, who you should hate.

But I saw now that kindness had NOTHING to do with being NICE.

It was ONLY EVER about refusing to participate in the handshake. Refusing to shield. Refusing to let my parasite coordinate with theirs.

That's what kindness meant. Not politeness. Not patience. Not gentleness.

Refusing to forsake their humanity, even while confronting their harm.

---

You could be FIERCE and kind. Could confront someone powerfully, hold them accountable, even fight them if necessary--while refusing to shield from their humanity.

Or you could be NICE and cruel. Could be patient, gentle, compassionate--while shielding. While seeing them as less than. While secretly letting your parasite coordinate with theirs underneath your pleasantness.

The world argues endlessly about whether people are too nice or too mean. Too permissive or too strict. Too soft or too hard.

All of it missing the point entirely.

---

The line I drew--between people who deserved compassion and people who deserved contempt--wasn't protecting anyone.

It was just giving my parasite a category of people it could feast on while I felt righteous about it.

---

This misdirection--arguing about nice versus mean, permissive versus strict--is ITSELF part of the mechanism. 

The parasites need us debating surface behavior. Need us focused on tone, on methods, on approach.

Because while we argue about HOW to treat people, the real distinction--shielding versus not shielding--stays completely invisible.

And the handshakes continue. Unopposed. Unexamined.

Hidden beneath every debate about civility and firmness.

◊◊◊

And then the medicine showed me bigger scales.

Not just individual interactions. Not just cultural arguments.

Entire worldviews. Entire systems of thought.

All of them carriers for the same mechanism.

◊◊◊

And then the medicine showed me something that made my blood run cold.

The ultimate form of shielding. The deepest handshake. The one that makes all the others possible.

---

It is impossible to communicate just how subtle our contempt can be while still accomplishing its dark mission. 

Simply by _perceiving reality as an intrinsically lifeless collection of "stuff" over which humanity has dominion_, we unwittingly reinforce the systems that permit corporations to plunder nature for profit; factory farms to brutalize helpless creatures; prisons to dehumanize inmates in ways that guarantee recidivism; and governments to send our young off to wars that only enrich the pockets of the rich. 

All of this and more is the _inevitable result_ of a broken worldview that blinds us to the infinite beauty of life, reducing it to mere stuff to be exploited—in other words, that encourages a subtle contempt for _reality as a whole_.

Not contempt for specific people.

Not contempt for groups or nations.

Contempt for EXISTENCE itself.

---

This is shielding at the most fundamental level possible.

When I shield from a person, I stop seeing their humanity. Their innocence. The light in them.

But this? This is shielding from REALITY. From the aliveness of everything. From the sacred nature of existence.

Once you see the world as dead matter--as resources, as stuff, as meaningless particles bouncing around--everything downstream becomes possible.

You can factory farm animals because they're just biological machines.

You can clearcut forests because they're just wood.

You can treat humans as labor units because we're all just complicated meat.

You can wage wars because nations are just competing for resources.

All of it flows inevitably from this one foundational lie:

That the world is dead.

---

And we enforce it for each other. Through what's considered "sophisticated" versus "naive." Through mockery of anything that suggests life might be sacred. Through education systems that teach us to see the world as dead matter.

Anyone who suggests the world might be alive? Might have inherent value? Might be sacred?

They get the same treatment as the "evil people."

Mockery. Contempt. Flattening into "just naive" or "just superstitious."

The shielding protecting itself.

---

A collective handshake with the parasites at the deepest possible level.

All of us spreading it. None of us planning it. All of us spreading it anyway.

This is the bedrock. The foundation the whole structure rests on.

◊◊◊

And it gets worse.

Because the parasites don't just need us to see the world as dead.

They need us to think we can THINK our way to truth. That rationality and intellect are our highest faculties. That anything we can't measure or prove doesn't exist.

---

The fetishization of rationality and intellect. The dismissal of anything we can't prove. The contempt for people who talk about "inner knowing" or anything that can't be measured.

Keeping us locked in our thinking minds. The very tool our parasites use to hide themselves.

---

Do you see the trap?

The parasite operates through self-deception. Through hiding in the gaps of our thinking. Through justifications and rationalizations.

And then it convinces us that THINKING is our only reliable tool for seeing truth.

The perfect trap.

Use thought to prove thought is all there is. Mock anyone who suggests otherwise. Dismiss "inner knowing" or "intuition" or "conscience" as inferior to rigorous analysis.

All while the parasite hides in the very process of analysis itself.

---

We can THINK our way into justifying anything. Any atrocity. Any harm. Any darkness.

"The data shows..." "Studies indicate..." "Rationally speaking..."

All of it potentially infected. All of it potentially the parasite using our intellect as camouflage.

But we can't think our way to seeing this. That's the point. The trap is the thinking itself.

---

And what does our culture do to people who suggest there might be knowing that doesn't come from thought?

Mockery. Contempt. "Anti-intellectual." "Superstitious." "Irrational."

The same mechanism. Protecting itself. Making sure we stay trapped in the tool it controls.

---

Wise people tell us to have compassion for evildoers. Our culture treats this as naive. Weak. Dangerous even.

Because compassion might mean refusing to shield. Refusing to flatten them. Refusing the handshake.

And the parasites can't allow that.

So they make compassion look like foolishness. Make contempt look like strength. Make fierce rationality look like wisdom. Make the handshake look like justice.

All of it protecting the mechanism.

◊◊◊

And here's what finally broke me completely.

What made everything come together in the most devastating way.

---

The "evil people"--the ones we all agree are fundamentally bad, the ones who REALLY deserve contempt--they're doing the same thing.

They're not fundamentally different. They're not special villains. They're not a separate species of human.

They're just people who've been shielding for so long, from so many directions, for so many years, that the shielding has become total.

---

Think about it.

They've been darkened by contempt. Made defensive. Made worse. Had their humanity denied so many times that they've learned to shield completely. To flatten others before being flattened themselves.

Every time someone treated them with contempt, they got a little darker. A little more defensive. A little more convinced the world is hostile.

Every time someone shielded from THEIR humanity, they learned to shield a little harder in return.

They've shaken so many hands with so many parasites--had so many parasites fed by their own--that they can barely see anything else anymore.

The shielding became automatic. Total. A survival mechanism so entrenched they don't even know they're doing it.

---

And our contempt for them? Our certainty that THEY'RE different, THEY'RE special, THEY'RE evil?

That just pushes them deeper. Proves to them that their shielding is necessary. That humanity really IS hostile. That they need to shield even harder to survive.

Which makes them worse.

Which proves we were right about them.

Which justifies our contempt.

Which pushes them deeper.

The same mechanism. At every level. Feeding itself.

---

But here's the thing that made me want to scream:

We've made them into humanity's collective dumping ground.

---

Think about it. Every society needs them. Needs people who are SO bad, SO evil, SO beyond the pale that everyone else can unite in condemning them.

The fall guys. The ones we can all agree to hate. The ones whose badness justifies our contempt. The ones who prove that evil really does exist OUT THERE, not in us.

We NEED them to be irredeemable. Because if they're not--if they're just more shielded versions of us--then we'd have to look at ourselves.

So we make them worse. Collectively. As a society. Through a million small acts of contempt and shielding.

And then use their worseness as proof they deserved it all along.

---

And they know this. Part of them knows.

Feels the silent message from all of us: "Sorry, someone has to be the fall guy. Someone has to be the evil one so the rest of us can feel good. And today, that someone is you."

Can you imagine what that does to a person? To sense that quiet agreement--that collective decision to make you the repository for everyone else's shadow?

It would make you so much worse. So much more defensive. So much more likely to shield completely.

Which makes them worse.

Which proves we were right about them.

Which justifies the whole thing.

---

The most evil people aren't fundamentally different from us.

They're what happens when the mechanism runs long enough. When enough people coordinate their contempt on someone. When someone is designated as the acceptable target.

We created them. Through the same mechanism operating in us. Through our need for someone to be fundamentally evil so we don't have to look at ourselves.

And then we use their existence as proof the mechanism is necessary. As proof some people really ARE beyond redemption. As proof our contempt is justified.

The perfect self-fulfilling prophecy.

The perfect trap.

---

And the worst part?

Part of me had always known this too.

I knew I was maintaining my self-deception to reinforce theirs. Knew they were doing the same. Knew we were all doing it simultaneously. Knew our parasites were coordinating.

Knew I was shaking hands with their parasites while calling it justice.

I saw it. I knew it. And I kept doing it.

Because the alternative--seeing that evil wasn't fundamentally alien to me, that I was doing the same thing, that I was SPREADING it, that I was COORDINATING with it--was too threatening to face.

So I hid it. While part of me watched myself hide it. While that part knew exactly what I was doing.

I'm not just a hypocrite about being self-deceived.

I'm a hypocrite about knowing we're making each other worse.

I'm a hypocrite about knowing our parasites are in alliance.

I'm a hypocrite about shaking hands with the very thing I claim to fight.

The hypocrisy goes all the way down.

Oh god. Oh god oh god oh god.

---

The medicine wouldn't let me look away.

We're all caught in this. All spreading darkness to each other. All convinced we're different. All shoving each other deeper to prove it.

Our parasites coordinating. Working together. Using us as vehicles. Making us all worse while convincing each of us we're fighting evil.

All of us shaking hands with the thing we think we're fighting.

The system is self-reinforcing. Accelerating. Getting better at hiding itself.

And nobody's benefiting.

Not us. Not them. Not anyone.

Except the parasites themselves.

---

So what the fuck IS this thing?

What IS this pattern that coordinates across all of us? That makes our individual parasites work together? That spreads through networks while hiding itself from every host?

That uses us to perpetuate itself while convincing each of us we're free of it?

That gets us to shake hands with it while thinking we're fighting it?

How is this coordination even POSSIBLE?

How does my parasite know to coordinate with theirs? How does the message transmit--complex, precise, instantaneous--through such narrow channels? How do we all maintain the same mechanism without ever discussing it? Without planning it?

What's the MECHANISM?

---
