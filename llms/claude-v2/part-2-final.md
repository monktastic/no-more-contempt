# Part II: The Infection

The medicine wouldn't let me look away.

The darkness—it didn't spread only when I was in direct interaction with people. That subtle sense of superiority came through just from the way I carried myself, spreading darkness wherever I went.

I could see it in how people responded to me. Something would shift when I walked into a room—barely perceptible, but there. People would tense slightly, close off, become more guarded. Not because I'd said anything. Just from... something I was emanating.

And then I saw it from the other side. Times when someone walked into a room and _I'd_ tensed up. Felt that subtle defensiveness rise without knowing why. They hadn't done anything—but something in how they carried themselves, some faint whiff of superiority or judgment, and I was already resisting them. Already hardening.

It wasn't in their words. It wasn't even in their face. It was something underneath. And I could feel it as clearly as if they'd spoken it aloud.

Which meant they could feel mine too.

_Oh god. They'd always been able to._

---

"I'm smarter than others." "I'm morally superior to my enemies, to the bad people." Both carried that same dark energy in different forms. Both signaled "I deserve more." More attention, more right to judge, whatever. Just *more*.

Sometimes other people's minds darkened in *resistance* to mine—those I felt superior _to_. Sometimes their minds darkened _alongside_ mine—those I felt superior _with_: my other smart friends, political allies, etc.—bravely allied against the forces of stupidity, evil, etc.

Have you ever bonded with allies over contempt for the enemy? Can you feel the... almost bloodlust... being fomented? Where does that dark energy go when you part ways? It doesn't just magically vanish. It leaks into everything, invisibly, inevitably. Into all areas of life.

I wasn't directly harming anyone, so I didn't notice that I was constantly in a mild form of limbo—but I saw now that that's what it was. There's no other way a person can carry themselves like that. I _knew_ it was darkening the field around me—but who could prove such a ridiculous claim? So what reason did I have to stop?

When people met me with that same energy—confrontational, "I'm going to put you in your place"—I just used it as an excuse to dig in more. Darkness feeding darkness. Didn't they know that's what would happen? Of course they did. Fuck 'em.

The plausible deniability governments used to execute dark operations—it was made of the same stuff as the cover I used to mock my enemies. And there was no hard boundary separating them. My own darkness flowed outward through unseen channels, via friends, strangers, enemies, infecting everything it touched, empowering both those who I agreed with and those who I hated equally.

I was sick to my stomach.

---

I saw that energy ripple out and reach an oil executive—exactly the kind of person I hated for destroying our precious planet. The kind I gladly spread contempt for. I watched as it tipped the balance on a crucial decision, in the wrong direction. And I saw, unmistakably, unavoidably, the horrifying truth: my fingerprints were all over that decision.

I don't know how to put it any better than that. I'm not denying people agency. I'm not excusing anyone. Their choices are their own. And yet I watched, helplessly, as part of my very own hand signed that ink, sealing the fate on yet another ecological disaster.

I saw how all our contempt had subtly convinced him that *we* were the problem. How that had secretly been the point—just as when I mocked someone face to face, but via even more convoluted causality; harder to trace.

I was shown the intense burden of his life; the hidden despair and abuse behind the squeaky clean image. Isn't that what it is to be human? 

I'd made his life just a tad bit worse, in ways that could never be linked back to me. And then, predictably, I used it to justify my own consumption; my unwillingness to change my habits.

The medicine didn't want me to feel sympathy for him. It didn't *want* me to feel anything. It was just... showing me.

---

Hadn't I always known this is how it worked?

I had. And that's exactly why I had done it.

I had been shoving people deeper into the abyss—to prove it was their fault, not mine.

I knew I had helped create the conditions under which such choices became natural. A darker shittier world where we each have to look out for ourselves. In which others aren't trying to see us in our full humanity. Where we all reduce each other to cardboard cutouts; props in our moral theater, where we're the brave noble souls, on a mission to defeat the evil out there.

I knew such a world would help me hide my own complicity. In exactly the same way I knew that mocking my enemy would license more, I knew that these subtle field effects would, too—and they'd be more invisible; easier to hide.

I was darkening the entire ambient field—just to keep my own darkness hidden.

The medicine showed all this gently. I don't think my psyche would have survived it otherwise.

It was like part of me was orchestrating all of this with impossible cleverness. Knew exactly how to create the conditions I needed. Same effect, longer distance, harder to detect.

My fear around money—I saw how it wove itself into my surroundings, nudging people toward being the greedy people I always knew they were. That oil exec flashed in my mind again. Same energy, different form.

My contempt. My fear. Their greed. His violence. All the same darkness. All feeding the same pool.

---

Just then I heard a siren in the distance—in real life.

In my mind's eye I saw a mother bent over, sobbing helplessly as her teenage baby boy lay dying in her arms. How an understaffed 911 had failed to reach him in time. How he'd joined a gang out of desperation, his mother too busy working two jobs. How I'd had a hand in all of it. And how I had looked down on them all, so that everyone would know who the good guy was.

---

And it showed up in so many forms I'd never recognized as the same thing.

When someone said something ambiguous, I'd choose the darker interpretation. Assume dishonesty, bad faith.

In my activism, I'd confront people about harm they caused. And I was RIGHT—their actions did cause harm. But I didn't engage to help them see. I engaged in ways designed to make them defensive. Because if they actually changed? I'd lose my justification for contempt.

It had felt completely authentic at the time. But looking back, I could see: not completely. I had just chosen not to look—knowing that nobody could prove this was what I was really doing.

When I cut someone off in traffic, I had a reason—running late, had to, my situation was different. When they cut me off? No excuse. Just selfishness. 

The hypocrisy itself spread darkness. People sensed it. It licensed their own.

Each one gave me a little thrill when I did it. A small victory. A justified exception. "Sticking it to the man" when it was really just selfishness.

And I could see it all so clearly in others. Their hidden motives, their bullshit justifications. I was perceptive. And I used that clarity as proof I wasn't doing it myself.

Even my compassion—genuinely wanting to help, yes. But also wanting to be seen as compassionate. The help real, but infected with positioning that made people smaller.

That software project I'd spent years building—I genuinely cared about helping people, but I also wanted recognition. Wanted to prove I was sophisticated.

When I chose the complex solution over the simple one? "Better engineering." When users struggled? "They're not thinking hard enough." The tiny biases in each decision compounded into real harm. Users frustrated, struggling, giving up. 

Even beating myself up. "I'm so terrible." But that positioned me as judge above the terrible person. Self-contempt was still contempt. Still the same mechanism.

And here was the worst part: just as I'd known my mockery might silence my enemies short-term but produce long-term harm, part of me had known this infection would eventually undermine the good it produced.

All of it the same darkness. All of it feeding the same field.

---

Even on the occasions when I *did* catch myself exposing my darkness—like when I used it to fight "evil people"?

I'd convinced myself I was only harboring darkness to fight them. It wasn't *real* darkness, only *strategic.* A burden the good people carried to keep real evil in check.

What a crock.

---

The microplastics in the food. The breakdown of institutions. The crumbling infrastructure. The loneliness epidemic.

My arrogance had been woven into all of it. Not causing these things directly—that would be too obvious—but feeding the field that made them inevitable. Making the world harsher, more justified in not caring, more accepting of decay.

It's as though the microplastics were made of my contempt. Again, I don't know how to phrase it any better than that, but all the horrors of the world reeked faintly of my own self-deception—a smell I could never wash off completely.

Sometimes I could trace it—this executive, this contempt, this decision. But the medicine was showing me far more than that. Vast causal networks, impossibly subtle, that I knew even as I saw them could never be brought back. Not because they were hidden from me, but because holding them wasn't what it meant to be human. I was allowed to bring back just enough to know for certain it was real—and that I had a role to play in healing it.

---

Even when the limbo was this subtle—just feeling slightly superior—my calculations were compromised. Part of me was angling to gain some hidden advantage at the world's expense, though I could never quite detect it. There was always some justification; some perfectly good explanation.

And the worst part is, it went all the way down to my basic assumptions about reality itself—what the world is made of, what consciousness is, what life is. I'd worked so hard to convince myself they were pure and rational. But they were all subtly infected, with cascading effects on everything downstream: what I thought mattered, how I tried to help, how I moved through the world.

I'd been so sure of myself, and the good I was doing.

But it was all fucking bullshit.

"*All of it?*" the medicine gently prodded.

---

I was taken back to a faint memory. A time when I'd been corrected in a way that actually made a difference. I'd been put in my place—but curiously, without a hint of that "I'm going to put you in your place" energy I'd always assumed was necessary. Instead, this person got absolutely nothing out of it—no satisfaction, no validation, no ego boost. But there was more to it than that.

She was angry at what I'd done. But she was correcting me TOWARD something, not just punishing me for being defective. She refused to give up on me. Even in her anger. Like the behavior was foreign to my nature, not proof of it.

Through the fierceness of her tone and gaze—or maybe more like integrated with it—was something that pierced straight through my defenses. She wasn't looking at the part of me that had fucked up. She was looking _past_ it, to something deeper. Something I'd forgotten was there.

The part that existed before the limbo state. Before the infection. The part that had never wanted to do wrong—that never _could_ want to.

And in seeing it, she _reminded me it was still there_.

It felt something like:

> _Your darkness will not be tolerated. But you are welcome back into the Light whenever you choose._

I can't fully capture it in words, but I knew exactly what it was—like remembering something I'd buried so deep I'd convinced myself it was lost. It gave my own dark side absolutely nothing to latch onto, to justify itself to me—and I felt its grip weaken.

It's not that I didn't fight back—who likes losing face like that?—but I knew immediately I couldn't win. Just like you can't win a direct confrontation with your own conscience.

In fact, that's _exactly_ what it felt like: my own conscience, peering back at me through someone else's eyes.

---

And then I remembered: I'd offered this to others, too. Times I'd stood up for something with that same clean fierceness. No contempt underneath. No satisfaction in being right. Just unwavering clarity about what mattered.

It had felt completely different from the infected moments. Both would be called "righteousness"—but they couldn't be more different. I could _feel_ the difference when I was in it. When that person corrected me, I could _feel_ it in them.

In those clean moments—the fierceness with no contempt—I'd needed no calculation. But calculation was still okay there. Oh... *that's* what the medicine had been hinting me toward.

*That was the only time my calculations could be fully trusted.* The only time they weren't sullied by subtle rationalizations.

There was no way to figure out if I was in limbo by thinking harder about it. The whole cognitive apparatus was subtly compromised in a way that prevented detection. That's what made it so insidious: the deeper in I went, the more certain I was that I wasn't.

---

That's how the darkness had gotten me. I'd embraced my _ideas_ of right and wrong—my moral positions, my justified contempt, my righteous causes. And I'd abandoned the part of me that actually *knew* the difference between acting from light and acting from darkness.

That's what the limbo state was: a way to disorient me so I couldn't tell what was what. So I couldn't trust my own perception of right and wrong. So I'd have to rely on calculation instead—which was exactly what kept me trapped.

The clean moments had felt like _me_. More me than anything else. No justifications, no hiding necessary. The infected moments—those felt like something else. Something foreign to my nature. Somehow simultaneously me and yet not. I desperately needed to know what it was.

But for now, the mushrooms let that question linger.

---

I had known the right way. The clean fierceness with no contempt. And I'd chosen the other way anyway. Used it to shove people deeper into darkness. Then judged them for being there.

And a part of me had known I was doing this, even as I did it. It had been buried so deeply I'd convinced myself it would never be exposed. Yet here it was, all spilling out.

Didn't I know this day would come? 

*God, I'd even fooled myself about that.*

I was the biggest hypocrite of all.
