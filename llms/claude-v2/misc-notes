What the reader should know after

Part I
- The limbo state is the only way I can cause harm.
- My mockery contains a subtle signal to them that's hidden from me, and this combo creates a recursive pattern that makes them dig in, which is the goal I secretly wanted, because it justifies my treatment of them.
- There's a part of me that's doing this => wait, *I* am doing this.
- I can sense that contempt from others comes from a bad place, regardless of what they're saying. How?
- The recursive pattern
- You needed them to get worse so you could believe you didn't make them worse.
- You honestly believed you were helping. (Hint: you can't trust your own conscious mind. cannot calculate your way to goodness)

What needs cutting / moving:
- Indirect spreading to this enemy through allies. Can be cut to just showing how it reinforces their self-deception.
- Feeling superior to others
- The way you explained something "obvious" to someone.
- I was explaining something technical to a colleague.

Q:
- Does the reader realize that the purpose is to enable their own self-serving behavior _in general_? Or is that a Part II reveal?


Part II (so many kinds/degrees of self-deception/hypocrisy, ripples outward, feeds back)
- Self-deception ripples from the person you mocked
- Ripples from allies
- I'm in limbo SO often (show the kinds/degrees of self-deception/hypocrisy)
- Trace a ripple outward until it reaches an oil exec (who should be referenced earlier as the kind of person I hate), subtly informing his choices. I then judge him for that choice, how it proves he's fundamentally defective.
- I use it to justify my own oil consumption. But part of me knew.
- People can sense I'm in limbo somehow. It affects them subconsciously. Gives them permission to enter it themselves.
- The factory farm worker, CEO, etc.
- The system doesn't need anyone to be a monster. It just needs people who can maintain limbo.
- It spreads through my projects.
- Cutting someone off (hypocrisy)
- "If I were self-deceived, I'd see it--I'm perceptive, look how clearly I see THEM doing it. The fact that I don't see it in myself means it's not there."
- And I couldn't think my way out. Every attempt to monitor myself, ...
- An example of being treated with fierce compassion.
- Treating someone else with fierce compassion. I KNEW there was something different about that.

What needs cutting / moving:
- Who is it benefiting? Oh shit, the self-deception itself. It's propagating itself to create a world where everything sucks. [needs way more color. it's hiding itself from me so that i think i'm using it for my benefit.]
- What part of us—or what part of our entire civilization—would benefit from not seeing this? From keeping it in limbo?
