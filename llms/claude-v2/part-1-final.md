# Part I: Limbo

## The Limbo State

Think back to a time when you skirted your conscience—acted against your own deepest values while pretending it was okay. In that moment, part of you knew full well that you were doing wrong, but you avoided looking at that knowledge, so that it didn't _feel_ wrong. All you could hear were your own clever justifications.

The knowledge wasn't unconscious. It was perfectly conscious—it just existed in a kind of limbo state: a bizarre, paradoxical schism of mind, in which you both _knew_ and yet somehow _didn't._ 

We know we can't win a direct confrontation with our conscience, and we can never truly silence it, so this is the next best thing: have our justifications live alongside it.

Try imagining doing something you know is wrong—_fully_ knowing it's wrong, with no rationalization—and doing it anyway. Can you even picture it?

The limbo state isn't just about avoiding guilt. It's how we _license ourselves_ in the first place. You literally cannot override your conscience without hiding the knowing from yourself.

It's a profound form of self-deception—but it doesn't make you bad. We all do it, as a kind of defense against a seemingly-uncaring world. In ourselves, we see it as a minor flaw, but when others do it, we see them as "bad"—giving us one more thing to have to defend against.

## The Signal

Think back to a time you mocked, shamed, or judged someone with contempt. You probably told yourself you were doing it to help—if not them, exactly, then at least the world. But if you're honest, part of you just wanted them to feel bad, *quite independent of any good it would do*.

This is a bit malicious, so we hide it from ourselves—that limbo state—and yet our target senses it anyway. It weakens their faith in humanity and reminds them that the world is dark. This makes them feel more licensed in their self-deception—which we take as a sign of inherent badness. *Strike one*.

What you see is a person who became defensive in response to your righteous behavior, instead of introspecting and thanking you for your wisdom. They're implicitly accusing _you_ of being evil. _Strike two._

But part of you suspects some truth in their accusation—and yet how could they possibly know about your malice? You barely knew it yourself. So their accusation can't be based on anything real. They must be projecting their own darkness onto you. _Strike three._

This person is well and truly defective, justifying your contempt.

And the world is even worse than you'd feared, justifying your self-serving behaviors in general—while also making it harder for you to recognize them as such.

But part of you suspects you intended this. So you must bury it even harder...

---

But how does the ruse actually work?

Well, they couldn't just sense your malice—they could sense that you were hiding it from yourself. So they knew that if they called you out on it, you'd just feign ignorance—and really believe it. And you *wanted* them to know that, because that's what makes it so devious... and they could sense that, too. Which you *also* wanted them to know...

Can you feel how it spirals? The recursion doesn't stop—it just keeps reflecting, creating that dizzying hall-of-mirrors feeling. It's like a shared secret: "*we both know what I'm really doing... and that I'll get away with it, because there's no way you could ever prove something so absurd.*"

You didn't have to *do* anything to darken their mind. The hidden intent executed itself through this recursive spiral. The mockery was just a convenient delivery vehicle.

The hiding *is* the revealing. The intention *is* the execution.

---

Is there some part of you that benefits from knowing your enemies really are as bad as you feared—like it helps the world make sense?

Is there a part that would benefit from making them *worse*? It would certainly give you more leeway in dealing with evil. Loosen the shackles, so to speak...

That's a bit horrifying to think about. So that part would have to keep itself hidden from view—especially while it was busy accomplishing its goals.

Almost like it's doing your dirty work for you while giving you plausible deniability. 

---

Isn't there a part of you that already knows this is what's happening? That all of us are doing this, in various forms, all the time?

We all know.

So why is nobody talking about it? Why has it not been fully pulled out of collective limbo?

---
## Shielding

If you could see the person fully—if you knew their hopes, dreams, and fears—this would have been hard to pull off, wouldn't it? You had to shield yourself from something. But what was it?

Their full humanity. You don't actually need their life story to see yourself in them—that's just how you naturally are before any shielding. And even the shielding can't make it fully go away—it can only hide it. There's a part of you that always sees it, buried beneath the part pretending not to.

Which means the very feeling of contempt—for the *person themselves*, not just their beliefs or behaviors—is an unmistakable sign that you're in limbo. In that darkened state, you cannot help but intend harm—which your target picks up on.

---

What would happen if you turned that shielding knob up to its maximum?

Then you'd know what it's like to be *evil*.

Evil people don't do a different thing than the rest of us—they just have a stronger version of the same thing. It's not that they don't know they're doing wrong—it's that the knowledge is correspondingly better hidden.

---
## The Stranger

Now suppose a stranger walks in and scolds you for your behavior. Part of you _knows_ they're right in their accusation—that you're doing essentially the same thing that "evil people" do—but do you thank them for it and repent?

Hell no! You feel more justified in your behavior. You—a perfectly decent person who knows full well you've done wrong—still dig in your heels when treated with contempt. Why?

It's not just because of your big ego. It's because _you can tell they're not coming from a good place._ You can feel this independently of their words. How? No really, how?

What does that tell you about the people _you_ treat with contempt—even when you're saying all the "right" things; even when you're on the "right side?"; even when they're genuinely wrong?

So we already know that contempt darkens minds, and evil people have the darkest minds of all.

What exactly are we doing by feeling contempt for them?

---

## The Transmission

Now watch how the game unfolds—how the hidden signal actually transmits.

I know I'm only pretending to be better than you. And somewhere in me, I know you can sense this falseness—because part of me is projecting it.

Which means I know I'm being a hypocrite. And I know _you_ know that—you can feel the lie in my contempt. And I want you to know it, too.

Which means we both know I'm pulling a ruse. There's this weird shared awareness of the game being played. Have you felt that before—that you both secretly know what's really going on?

Each level feels different. The first is simple dishonesty. The second adds hypocrisy. By the third, shame starts trying to break through—so I have to hide harder.

And it keeps going, who knows how many levels deep, eventually reaching what feels like pure malice. And you both know that neither of you can prove it—which is why it works. 

It works not *despite* being unprovable, but _because_ of it. 

What kind of thing works like *that*?

What started as the simple lie of feeling superior—barely worth mentioning—has transformed into something truly monstrous.

---

You know your enemies can only cause harm due to a mechanism you share. So what makes them "bad," exactly?

Or does "bad" simply mean "okay to pull this ruse on?"

Yet it feels like we can practically *see* their badness, *feel* it, doesn't it? Why?

Maybe that visceral sense of *badness* is just what's needed for us to feel okay harming them.

---

Now think back to a time you acted out of pure integrity. Were any justifications needed?

And now a time when you did wrong and someone confronted *you* out of that same integrity. Did you want revenge? How could you tell they were coming from a good place? No, really—how?

What were they serving in that moment?

---

## We already know

Doesn't part of us already know this is how it works? **Why aren't we all talking about this?**

It's almost like a shared secret that we've all agreed to keep, lest we spoil the game for everyone. 

But what kind of game is it, and who's really benefiting?

---

Did your behavior with that person darken the world or brighten it? Didn't part of you know the answer even as you did it? *How* did you know? No, really—how?

And yet, it felt completely righteous at the time. You probably even could have proven that it was.

One part of you was knowingly darkening the world, while another part was flawlessly confident you were helping—and *both parts were conscious*. And you've always known this. So why do you think you can you trust your calculations about right and wrong in general?

We already know all this—so why hasn't humanity found a solution? All the self-help, spirituality, neuroscience... and we're still off the rails, maybe harder than ever before. How can that be?

Is it just because the _bad people_ keep sabotaging it? Or is there a part of us all that would benefit from *not* finding the solution?

Could that part be what's collectively steering this ship?

It sure would explain a lot, wouldn't it?
