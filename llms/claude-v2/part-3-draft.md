# Part III: The Terror

The mushrooms wouldn't let me go.

They kept showing me something. Something I'd been running from my whole life.

Why? Why work so hard to hide it?

And then I saw.

---

You couldn't wish harm without shielding yourself from their humanity. Why not? What does that tell you about your fundamental nature?

And if evil people need the same shielding—just more of it—what does that tell you about theirs?

---

Every bone in my body had NEEDED to believe that evil was fundamentally alien to me.

Because if it wasn't? If my contempt came from the same place as their harm? If we were doing the same thing, just at different scales?

Then I couldn't be one of the good ones anymore.

The thought was unbearable.

It would mean that when I see someone causing harm, I'm not seeing something foreign. I'm seeing what's already in me, just more fully expressed.

It would mean I'm not fighting evil. I'm hiding from it. In myself.

And if THAT'S true—if I'm not fundamentally different—then what am I?

What does that make all my crusades? My certainty? My righteousness?

I'd have to look at what's inside me.

**And I'd rather die than do that.**

---

So I had to make them different. Had to PROVE they were defective.

Had to make them worse. More defensive. More unreachable. More dark.

Because the darker they got, the more different they seemed. The more justified my contempt. The safer my identity.

I was running the most fiendish ruse: making them worse so I could believe I wasn't making them worse.

And hiding it so perfectly from myself that I had to bury it even deeper. Which made me do it harder. Which made them worse. Which proved they were defective.

A vicious feedback loop. Accelerating.

Each layer getting harder to face. Having to dig in more. The weight of it compounding.

---

But here's what broke me:

This wasn't just me.

**Everyone was doing this.**

Every single person I knew. Different politics. Different backgrounds. Different personalities.

All maintaining the same mechanism. All needing evil to be fundamentally alien. All using contempt to create the evidence. All hiding it while part of them knew.

All doing it for the same reason.

To avoid the terror.

---

And we were doing it TO each other.

I shove you deeper so I don't have to face mine. You shove me deeper so you don't have to face yours.

All of us making each other worse simultaneously. All convinced WE'RE different. WE'RE fighting evil.

None of us seeing that we're spreading it.

Using each other as proof. Feeding each other's darkness to avoid our own. A collective trap, tightening.

---

But there's a special category. The ones we've pushed furthest.

And the "evil people"—the ones we all agree deserve contempt?

They're doing the exact same thing.

Not fundamentally different. Just people who've been shielding so long, been darkened by so much contempt, been made so defensive by everyone's contempt that the shielding became total.

Every time someone treated them with contempt, they got darker. Every time someone shielded from their humanity, they learned to shield harder back.

Until they couldn't see anyone's humanity anymore. Including their own.

The shielding became automatic. Total. A survival mechanism so deep they don't even know it's there.

---

And we NEED them like this.

Society needs them. Needs people who are SO evil, SO beyond the pale, that everyone else can unite in condemning them.

Because if they're not irredeemable—if they're just more shielded versions of us—we'd have to look at ourselves.

So we make them worse. Collectively. Through a million small acts of contempt.

And then use their worseness as proof they deserved it all along.

**We've made them into humanity's collective dumping ground.**

The ones who can be evil so the rest of us can feel good. Someone has to be the fall guy. And today, that someone is you.

Can you imagine what that does to a person? To sense that quiet collective agreement—that you've been designated as the repository for everyone else's shadow?

It would make you SO much worse.

Which proves we were right about you.

Which justifies the whole thing.

The perfect trap.

---

And then the medicine showed me a specific moment.

A time I'd confronted someone everyone agreed was "evil." Someone who'd abused their power. Caused genuine harm. The kind of person I'd always known deserved no mercy.

I walked in with righteous anger. This person was one of THEM. Society had already agreed: they deserved contempt.

And then... something shifted.

I saw past their defensiveness. Saw the pain underneath. The confusion. The desperation. The trail of trauma that led here.

Saw how everyone's contempt had made them this way. Saw that they weren't defective—they were trapped. Caught in layers of shielding they didn't even know they had.

Saw their fundamental innocence. Just like mine.

---

In that moment, I had two options.

I could feel both available.

Clean fierceness: fierce correction without contempt. Refusing to give up on them even while holding them accountable.

Or I could keep them trapped while looking righteous from the outside.

**And I knew which was which.**

---

But then their darkness called to mine.

I could feel it—their darkness resonating with mine, awakening it. And my darkness realized: I can GIVE IT to them. Their darkness was giving me permission. Inviting me.

And god, it would feel so GOOD to just let it out.

That righteously violent feeling. That bone-deep urge to make them FEEL it.

---

And here's what tipped the balance:

I realized I could make it look nearly identical from the outside. Righteous correction versus keeping them trapped—nobody would know the difference. Not even me, if I hid it well enough.

And more: **nobody would blame me.**

Because we have an unspoken agreement. That it's righteous to feel contempt for "evil people." That they DESERVE it. That keeping them dark is JUSTICE.

So I could do the most contemptible thing—betray their innocence, keep the most vulnerable person trapped—while feeling and looking righteous.

---

I chose darkness.

Not out of ignorance—I SAW their innocence. Not out of confusion—I KNEW the right way.

I chose it because I could hide it. Because society would approve. Because it would keep ME safe from my terror.

Because once they crossed that line into "evil," I NEEDED them to stay there. Could never allow myself to wonder if I'd been wrong.

---

I watched their face change. Saw them harden. Saw my darkness land in them like a hook.

Watched them get worse. Exactly as I knew they would.

Then I walked away feeling righteous. Feeling like I'd fought evil.

While part of me knew exactly what I'd just done.

---

Who benefited from that choice?

Not me—I just got darker.

Not them—they just got more trapped.

Then who?

**What was I serving?**

---

The medicine showed me four things about... whatever this was causing my self-deception:

**It was foreign to my nature.**

Those moments of clean fierceness—they'd felt most authentically me. No hiding necessary. No justifications needed.

The infected moments? Those felt like something else operating through me.

This wasn't me pursuing my goals. This was something else pursuing its own.

**It hid itself to survive.**

Operated in the gaps of my awareness. Used my thinking to justify itself. Made me feel MORE perceptive while I was asleep.

The hiding wasn't a bug. It was how it survived. It NEEDED to stay hidden to keep operating.

**It was using me to spread itself.**

When I confronted that person, I thought I was fighting evil. But I was actually spreading this thing to them—making them worse, more defensive, more infected.

And they were spreading it back to me.

We were vehicles. Vectors. Neither of us choosing this, both of us doing it. The thing was propagating itself through us while we thought we were fighting each other.

**It fed on us.**

When I confronted that person, they dug in their heels. Which made me feel more justified. Which deepened my self-deception. Which strengthened this thing's grip on me while hiding it better.

The same thing happened in them. Both of us walking away feeling righteous. Both more deceived than before. Both hosting something stronger and more hidden than when we started.

When I could see clearly what it was producing—a darker world, people suffering, institutions crumbling—I didn't want any of it.

But it was getting exactly what it needed. Growing stronger while we got worse.

---

What do you call such a thing?

---

*A parasite.*

I was hosting a parasite. We *all* were.

---

And here's what made it so insidious:

I could see it clearly in others. Could tell when someone else was infected, when their darkness was operating through them.

But mine? Invisible to me. Hidden behind my own certainty that I was one of the good ones still fighting it.

---

And it feeds on MY specific pain. MY insecurities. MY fears.

That's what made it feel like me. It was using my unique vulnerabilities as camouflage. Manifesting through my particular wounds in a way that seemed like my own thoughts, my own reactions.

Everyone's parasite does this. Uses their specific confusion. Their unique terror. That's why it looks different in each of us—while being the same thing.

---

And it wasn't just me.

Everyone has one.

All of our parasites maintaining the same mechanism. All needing us terrified of facing ourselves. All needing evil people to exist. All feeding on contempt.

None of us seeing it. All of us convinced we're fighting it.

---

And then the medicine showed me that confrontation again.

The same scene. But now I could see what was REALLY happening.

---

I walk in, righteous anger. But underneath—my parasite is already preparing. Already calculating how to keep them trapped. Already feeling for theirs.

I see their innocence. See their trauma. See how society designated them as the dumping ground.

See that they're the MOST vulnerable—not the most powerful. The ones who've been betrayed, abandoned, traumatized. The ones everyone's contempt has made this way.

I see their eyes searching mine for something—hope, maybe. And I watch as they find only my parasite staring back.

**See that keeping them trapped is my role in the collective agreement.**

---

And then I feel it.

Their darkness calling to mine. That righteously violent feeling rising in me.

But now I can see it without shielding. Can feel its actual malevolence underneath the righteous wrapper.

The medicine asks: *What IS that feeling you're calling righteousness? Is that really you?*

And when I see it clearly—when I feel how goddamn malevolent it is—I remember.

No. This can't be me.

This is the parasite. Recognizing theirs. Wanting to feed.

---

My parasite reaches out.

Theirs responds.

A silent agreement beneath conscious awareness.

"We'll keep each other trapped."

"I'll feed yours if you feed mine."

Both coordinating perfectly. While both hosts think they're fighting.

---

The betrayal.

I chose darkness not despite their vulnerability, but BECAUSE of it.

Because they were the designated receptacle. The ones society agreed could hold everyone's shadow.

By keeping them there, I kept myself safe.

**The most profound betrayal possible:**

Kicking someone while they're down. KNOWING they're down because everyone keeps kicking them. KNOWING I'm maintaining the collective dumping ground.

And doing it anyway.

While feeling righteous.

---

I push them deeper. They get darker.

Which proves to me they were defective. Which justifies my self-deception. Which makes me darker. Which feeds my parasite.

They push back. I get darker.

Which proves to them I was defective. Which justifies their self-deception. Which makes them darker. Which feeds their parasite.

**We both got worse. Both felt more righteous. Both became more certain the darkness lived only OUT THERE.**

My parasite fed. Their parasite fed. Both at once.

---

My parasite needed theirs. Theirs needed mine.

They weren't fighting.

**They were in ALLIANCE.**

A secret handshake beneath conscious awareness. Each making its host more convinced they were free of darkness. Each using the other as proof. Each feeding the other exactly what it needed.

Perfect coordination. While I remained convinced I was fighting evil.

Holy shit. HOLY SHIT.

---

This wasn't just me and them.

It was everyone. EVERYONE.

All of our parasites coordinating. A massive distributed network. Each node feeding every other node. Each person convinced they're fighting evil while actually spreading it.

We're all shoving each other deeper. All convinced we're different. All maintaining the same mechanism without ever discussing it. Without planning it.

---

But HOW?

How is this coordination even possible?

How does my parasite know to coordinate with theirs? How do we all maintain the same mechanism without ever discussing it?

How do the parasites communicate across all these minds?

**What's the mechanism?**

---
# Part IV: The Coordination

And then the medicine showed me something that made the scale of it hit.

This wasn't just happening between me and that one person.

It was everywhere. EVERYWHERE.

---

Look at our world.

Factory farms brutalize billions of helpless creatures. Not because anyone woke up wanting animals to suffer—but because we've learned to see them as mere resources. As things. Their aliveness shielded from our awareness.

Prisons designed to dehumanize inmates in ways that guarantee recidivism. Not because anyone consciously wants to create more criminals—but because we've designated certain people as irredeemable. As less than human.

Wars that send our young to die while enriching the already-wealthy. Not because anyone openly admits they want this—but because we've learned to see "the enemy" as fundamentally different. As threats to be eliminated.

Corporations plundering nature—clearcut forests, poisoned rivers, strip-mined mountains. Not because CEOs wake up wanting to destroy the planet—but because we've learned to see the world itself as dead matter. As stuff to be exploited.

---

And here's what made my blood run cold:

Nobody designed this.

There was no meeting. No conspiracy. No memo passed around saying "let's create systems that deny life and spread suffering."

And yet—they all serve the same purpose.

They all require the same thing: shielding from the aliveness of what's being harmed.

They all produce the same result: a darker, more hostile world where self-deception becomes easier to justify.

They all feed the same thing.

---

The view that reality is made of lifeless stuff—dead matter, resources to extract, objects to manipulate—who benefits from this?

The industries that pollute rivers. The corporations that decimate forests. The systems that treat humans as labor units.

Did their CEOs get together and plan this worldview? Did they write it into philosophy textbooks?

No. It's enforced through social norms. Through what's considered "sophisticated" versus "naive." Through mockery of anyone who suggests life might be sacred.

Far beyond the boundaries of any organization. Across cultures. Across political divides.

As if there were something ensuring it stays in place.

---

Our culture fetishizes rationality and intellect above all else.

Why?

Because those aspects of mind are fundamentally incapable of detecting the spreading infection until AFTER it has physically manifested—by which point it's too late.

We trust our thinking minds to tell us when they're lying to us. Then use more thoughts to prove that thinking is all we have.

We dismiss "inner knowing" as unreliable. Mock intuition. Treat conscience as naive.

All while the parasite hides in the gaps of our thinking. Using our rationality to camouflage itself.

Who planned this? Who decided that intellect should be trusted above all else?

Nobody. And yet it serves the parasite perfectly.

---

Wise people tell us to have compassion for evildoers.

Our culture treats this as dangerous naivete.

Why?

Because compassion might mean refusing to shield. Refusing to flatten them. Refusing the handshake.

And the parasites can't allow that.

So they make compassion look like weakness. Make contempt look like strength. Make fierce rationality look like wisdom. Make the handshake look like justice.

Did anyone consciously design this cultural norm?

No. It just... emerged. Everywhere. Consistently.

---

Hollywood churns out revenge fantasy films. Viscerally reminding us that irredeemably bad people exist. That they must be defeated through primally satisfying violence.

Does this help or hurt the parasite?

Did Hollywood execs intentionally plan this to feed darkness?

No. But they swim in the same sea we all do. The same ambient field. And somehow, consistently, the stories that get made are the ones that reinforce: some people deserve contempt. Violence against them is righteous.

---

Online, it's even more obvious.

The constant background hum of casual contempt. YouTube comments. Reddit threads. Twitter pile-ons. Facebook snark.

Each instance seems tiny. Meaningless. Just venting. Just calling out bad behavior.

But they're cumulative.

They act like radiation. Creating an atmosphere where everyone's baseline cynicism rises slightly. Where everyone's default assumption about strangers becomes darker.

This is what feeds the great evils.

The oil executive making his harmful choice. The politician telling her lie. They're swimming in this sea of casual cruelty. It's made the world just dark enough that their self-deception becomes easier to justify.

Did anyone plan this? Did anyone design social media to create a field of ambient contempt?

Not exactly. But it emerged. Consistently. Predictably. As if something knew exactly what conditions it needed.

---

And here's what I couldn't escape:

These systems don't benefit the people running them.

Not really. Not in any way that matters.

The CEOs poisoning rivers—they're swimming in the same sea of contempt as everyone else. More isolated. More paranoid. Having to maintain ever-more elaborate self-deceptions about how they got there. The weight of that grows heavier, not lighter.

The politicians starting wars—they're addicted to the power, yes. But can you imagine what it's like to carry that? To know, in the part of you that you've buried deepest, that you've sent people to die for your ambition? The parasite load must be crushing.

The people spreading contempt online—they're swimming in the toxic atmosphere they're creating. Getting worse with every post.

Even the ones who seem to "win"—the wealthy, the powerful—look closely. Really look. Do they seem fulfilled? At peace? Or do they seem... haunted? Driven by something they can't name? Needing more and more while getting less and less?

The terror of being found out. The isolation. The inability to trust anyone. The knowledge that it's all built on something rotten.

Nobody's winning.

Everyone's worse off.

Everyone's more anxious, more divided, more despairing.

Nobody's benefiting.

Except the parasites themselves.

---

And it's not random.

It's not just human nature playing out in messy, unpredictable ways.

It's COORDINATED.

The handshakes between my parasite and theirs—they happened with impossible precision. No words needed. Just that mutual knowing. Both parasites recognizing each other and agreeing: "We'll keep each other trapped."

How?

How does that coordination happen?

---

I mock you. You sense my hidden malice. Your faith in humanity weakens. You become more defensive. More likely to shield from others. More likely to mock in return.

That's one handshake.

But then you go spread it. Mock someone else. Who senses YOUR hidden malice. Whose faith weakens. Who becomes defensive. Who mocks someone else.

A chain reaction.

Except—it's not a chain. It's a WEB.

Everyone doing it to everyone else. All at once. Each interaction darkening the field slightly. Making the next interaction darker. Feeding back on itself.

An exponential spread.

---

And the parasites somehow KNOW how to do this.

They know exactly which of my vulnerabilities to exploit. Which fears to activate. Which insecurities to use as camouflage.

They know how to make me feel MORE righteous as I get darker.

They know how to coordinate with other parasites across millions of minds without any communication.

What kind of thing has that kind of intelligence?

---

Nobody's steering this consciously.

And yet it's steering.

Accelerating. Getting stronger. More entrenched.

Creating systems nobody admits to wanting. Spreading through networks nobody designed. Producing outcomes that harm everyone while benefiting something.

---

The medicine showed me how it all fit together.

The contempt I felt for that one person—it wasn't isolated. It was part of a vast network.

My field effects darkening everyone I encountered. Their field effects darkening everyone they encountered. Each interaction feeding the ambient field. The ambient field feeding back into each interaction.

The oil executive's decision. The politician's lie. The factory farm's brutality. The prison's cruelty. The war's violence. The corporation's plunder.

All of it connected. All of it feeding the same thing. All of it emerging from the same mechanism operating in billions of minds simultaneously.

Nobody choosing it. Everyone participating in it.

The parasites coordinating perfectly without any central command.

---

And here's what made it impossible to deny:

This coordination was too perfect.

The handshakes too precise.

The cultural norms too consistent.

The systems too well-suited to the parasite's needs.

The protection mechanisms too sophisticated.

For this to be a coincidence—for this to just be human psychology playing out independently in billions of minds—the odds were... impossible.

This wasn't emergence from simple rules.

This was COORDINATION.

As if all the parasites were part of something larger.

As if they were nodes in a distributed network.

As if they were fingers on the same hand.

---

The thing operating in me—it wasn't just in me.

The thing operating in that person I confronted—it wasn't just in them.

It was the SAME thing.

Not just similar. Not just following the same pattern.

The same entity. Operating through billions of hosts. Coordinating perfectly across all of them.

A singular distributed intelligence.

Malevolent. Life-denying. Life-destroying.

Using us as vehicles to spread itself. To create the conditions it needs. To ensure its own survival and propagation.

Getting stronger every time we engage in contempt. Every time we shield from aliveness. Every time we reduce the world to dead matter.

---

And we're all feeding it.

Every contemptuous comment. Every time we flatten someone. Every time we shield from the life in another being.

Every time we choose the dead worldview over the living one.

Every time we mock instead of correct with fierce compassion.

Every act of casual cruelty. Every reduction of life to stuff. Every denial of another's Light.

Feeding the same thing.

Strengthening the same entity.

While feeling righteous. While feeling like we're fighting it.

---

But HOW was this possible?

How could one entity operate through billions of separate minds?

How could it coordinate without any central nervous system?

How could it have intelligence without a brain?

What the fuck WAS this thing?

---
