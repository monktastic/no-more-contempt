# The Pattern: How Evil Hijacks Our Goodness

> _For so long as the root of wickedness is hidden, it is strong. But when it is recognized, it is dissolved. When it is revealed, it perishes. ... It is powerful because we have not recognized it._ — The Gospel of Philip

## Prelude

Once, on a "heroic dose" of psilocybin, I was shown exceedingly painful truths about myself—about how unkind I almost constantly was, in ways I never would have identified as "unkind." I was *so sure* I was only giving people what they deserved.

Then I was shown that part of me had *known* what I was really doing.

I saw how the mechanism that allowed me to do this—and to hide it from myself—contained the essence of *all the evil there ever was.* One mistake, operating at all scales. And every time I did it myself, I was lowering the threshold for others to make the same mistake.

Then I saw that I had always known *this*, too. I'd been hiding that knowledge as well.

But when I encountered what lay *beneath* all the hiding—that's when I saw something impossibly hopeful. How the battle could be won—not by fighting more viciously, but by refusing to turn away from what's authentically true; what we all already know, deep down. What we could never *actually* forget.

Two decades later, I'm still reeling from the implications.

Every major wisdom tradition has warned about this: something that hijacks human consciousness while tricking us into believing that it hasn't—at least, not in *us*—and how it uses our own goodness against us.

I'd always considered it a metaphor, until I saw how concrete it really was.

I came to call this hidden mechanism "the pattern"—or, when it shows its face, "the darkness."

I think I saw something civilization needs to understand right now. I'm probably wrong about parts of it, I'm **definitely** still caught in the pattern I'm describing, and this is going to sound grandiose, but—I think the stakes are high enough that I need to try anyway.

You'll see the pattern operating in how I write this—the subtle positioning, the satisfaction of "figuring something out," the tone that sometimes slips into teaching-mode. I can feel it happening as I type. I haven't transcended this, and I'm not going to wait until I do—because that waiting feels like another form of it.

Can you feel it—the *evil people* out there, ruining it for the rest of us?

How do they make you feel? How do you want *them* to feel? Be totally honest.

Would some tiny part of you be disappointed to discover they're not *fundamentally* evil—that they're just badly confused but inherently redeemable people like the rest of us? Would that part feel robbed of the right to deliver the righteous vengeance they so richly deserve?

Here's a test: if you had to choose between delivering that vengeance and offering them a pill that would instantly enlighten them—which would you choose? Forget about the "right" answer. Is there a tiny flicker in there that's itching to mash that first button?

What is that part of you trying to accomplish?

What is it *actually* accomplishing?

That part of you, and that part of me—they're *working together.*

I don't know you. My politics may be diametrically opposite yours. 

And yet it doesn't matter. They're still working together.
