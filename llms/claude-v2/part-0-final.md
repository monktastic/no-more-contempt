# The Pattern: How Evil Hijacks Our Goodness

> _For so long as the root of wickedness is hidden, it is strong. But when it is recognized, it is dissolved. When it is revealed, it perishes. ... It is powerful because we have not recognized it._ — The Gospel of Philip

## Prelude

Once, on a "heroic dose" of psilocybin, I was shown something that shattered my understanding of good and evil. It wasn't a gentle insight—it was a cascading series of revelations, each more devastating than the last, that demolished my entire worldview and replaced it with something infinitely more mysterious and meaningful.

Two decades later, I'm still reeling from the consequences.

What I saw wasn't just about psychology or morality. It was about the fundamental architecture of evil—how it operates, how it spreads, and most disturbingly, how it uses _our own goodness_ against us.

I saw something that every major wisdom tradition has warned about: there is something that hijacks human consciousness while tricking us into believing that it hasn't—at least, not in *us.*

What follows is an attempt to show you what I saw—and why it matters more urgently than anything else we could be doing right now.

I came to call this hidden mechanism "the pattern"—or, when it shows its face, "the darkness."

As I write about it, you'll probably sense it operating in me—in my tone; in the way I'm subtly positioning myself as having figured it all out. I haven't—but I think it's helpful enough to share that I don't want to wait til I'm enlightened.

Can you feel it—the *evil people* out there, ruining it for the rest of us?

How do they make you feel? How do you want *them* to feel? Be totally honest.

Would some tiny part of you be disappointed to discover they're not *fundamentally* evil—that they're just badly confused but inherently redeemable people like the rest of us? Would that part feel robbed of the right to deliver the righteous vengeance they so richly deserve?

Here's a test: if you had to choose between delivering that vengeance and offering them a pill that would instantly enlighten them—which would you choose? Forget about the "right" answer. Is there a tiny flicker in there that's itching to mash that first button?

What is that part of you trying to accomplish?

What is it *actually* accomplishing?

That part of you, and that part of me—they're *working together.*

I don't know you. My politics may be diametrically opposite yours. 

And it doesn't matter. They're still working together.
