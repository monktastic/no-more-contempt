# The Pattern: How Evil Hijacks Our Goodness

> _For so long as the root of wickedness is hidden, it is strong. But when it is recognized, it is dissolved. When it is revealed, it perishes. ... It is powerful because we have not recognized it._ — The Gospel of Philip

# Prelude

The world is tearing itself apart.

Political division in the US is at historic highs. Authoritarian movements are rising globally. Trust in institutions is collapsing. And beneath it all, civilizational crises—climate, AI, nuclear proliferation—that would be nearly impossible to solve even if we _were_ working together.

We all know the obvious culprits: governments and corporations hiding dark agendas behind plausible deniability and sophisticated manipulation. The corruption is real. The evil is real.

But here's what keeps me up at night: **they know exactly what they're doing. And simultaneously—in a way that seems impossible—they don't.**

Before you close this thinking I'm making excuses for evil, let me be clear: we **must** stop them. But what I discovered is that our normal way of fighting them—with contempt, with righteous anger, with the certainty that we're fundamentally different from them—isn't just failing.

**It's making things worse.**

That same manipulativeness—the scheming, the bad faith, the willful blindness—exists in me too. And every time I engage in it, I strengthen theirs.

Carl Jung called this the _shadow_—that part of ourselves we'd rather not face. He spoke of how our individual shadows contribute to a collective darkness that makes atrocities possible.

So what makes this new? Here's the first thing I saw with devastating clarity:

**It's not accidental.**

Part of me has always _known_ that my choices to be out of integrity have lent strength to the very evils I claim to oppose. Not because I'm a bad person. I'm not, and neither are you. But because **this part of me benefits when the world gets darker.** When trust breaks down. When contempt spreads. When everyone becomes a little more like the "bad people" we're fighting.

And then the other shoe dropped:

**It's not truly unconscious.**

I can't blame it on an unconscious part of myself. It has always been accessible to my conscious mind. I had just chosen not to look. *We're all making that choice, to one degree or another.*

Here's what makes it so insanely difficult to see: **it hides this from me in the cleverest possible ways.** It convinces me I'm fighting evil, that I'm one of the good ones, that my contempt is justified and righteous and _working_. All while it's doing the opposite.

**This is why everything we're trying isn't working.** Not because we're not fighting hard enough. Not because the other side is too powerful. But because something operating through us is doing the darkness's work while we think we're fighting it.

---

**Fair warning:** 

The insight arrived on a "heroic dose" of psilocybin two decades ago, and has been slowly congealing ever since. Given that, why should you trust it?

You shouldn't. Blindly trusting me would be worse than useless. But you *can* look and discover it for yourself, if you're willing. Why would you want to?

**Because understanding this mechanism is the only way to actually stop it.**

Every major wisdom tradition has pointed at it: something that hijacks human consciousness while tricking us into believing it hasn't—at least, not in _us._ It's moving through all of us, using our attempts to fight it as fuel. 

I'd always considered it a metaphor, until I saw how concrete it really was. And once you see how it works, you can't unsee it.

I want to share my own way of pointing it out—one that might work better for modern people.

---

**What to expect:**

This is for you if you're willing to look at your own darkness without collapsing into shame. If you sense that spiritual traditions are pointing at something real—even if you can't stand the bypassing and platitudes. If you're aching for someone to finally name what you've already sensed but couldn't quite articulate.

I'm going to use language like "Light" and "darkness." Not as metaphors, but as the most precise terms I have for what's actually happening. If that language bothers you, feel free to translate it. But I'm going to ask you to hold something as a working hypothesis:

What if, at your core, you are Light itself? And what if everyone else is too—even the people doing terrible things?

If that feels impossible or naive right now, that's okay. Just stay curious about _why_ it feels impossible. There's something important in that resistance. We'll get there.

---

I'm probably wrong about parts of it, definitely still caught in it myself, and this is going to sound grandiose, but—I think the stakes are high enough that I need to try anyway.

You'll see the pattern operating in how I write this—the subtle positioning, the satisfaction of "figuring something out," the tone that sometimes slips into teaching-mode. I can feel it happening as I type. I haven't transcended this, and I'm not going to wait until I do—because that waiting feels like another form of it.

> _The earth is not dying, it is being killed, and those who are killing it have names and addresses._ —Utah Phillips

Can you feel it—the _evil people_ out there, ruining it for the rest of us?

How do they make you feel? How do you want _them_ to feel? Be totally honest.

Would some tiny part of you be disappointed to discover they're not _fundamentally_ evil—that they're just badly confused but inherently redeemable people like the rest of us? Would that part feel robbed of the right to deliver the righteous vengeance they so richly deserve?

Here's a test: if you had to choose between delivering that vengeance and offering them a pill that would instantly enlighten them—which would you choose? Forget about the "right" answer. Is there a tiny flicker in there that's itching to mash that first button?

What is that part of you trying to accomplish?

What is it _actually_ accomplishing?

---

That part of you, and that part of me—they're _working together._

I don't know you. My politics may be diametrically opposite yours.

And yet it doesn't matter. They're still working together.

---# Part I: Contempt
## Conscience

Have you ever done something you knew was wrong at the time, but couldn't fully admit it to yourself until later? Maybe you made a cruel comment to boost your ego, took credit for someone else's work, or cheated on a test (or even partner).

While you were doing it, wasn't one part of you—your conscience—telling you it was wrong, while another was busy producing justifications for why it wasn't *really* wrong?

Notice an asymmetry here: your conscience wasn't trying to justify itself. It just... *was*. The part providing justifications wasn't trying to convince *it*; it was trying to convince *you*—that your conscience was just one more voice among the noise.

But it isn't.

We *know* we can't win a direct confrontation with our conscience. All we can do is find better ways of ignoring it.

So you did—and yet some part of you sensed this wouldn't end well, didn't it? 

---
## Limbo

You might have convinced yourself you didn't "really" know it was wrong, right up until you were able to admit it—at which point you saw that you *always had*.

Notice this: both halves—the undeniable wrongness and the conviction of rightness—were actually conscious **the entire time**. Not hidden in some unconscious realm waiting to emerge. Right there. You just kept your attention carefully turned away.

That knowledge existed in a kind of "limbo state": a bizarre schism of mind in which we know something—*consciously*—and yet are **sure** we don't... until we retroactively discover that we always did.

It's a profound form of self-deception, but we don't do it because we're "bad people." Ignoring our conscience is a kind of defense against a world we perceive as hostile, rightly or wrongly. In ourselves, it feels like an innocent flaw—forgivable, given all we've seen and faced. But when others do it? We see them as inherently bad.

---
## Contempt and Integrity

Think back to a moment you felt contemptuously judged by another person. No matter how "right" they may have been; even if you *knew* you had done wrong, something felt *off* about them, didn't it? You could tell they weren't coming from a good place. How?

Now think of a time when someone set you straight with profound integrity—seemingly getting nothing out of it themselves. Even if it stung your ego; made you lose face, you had no desire to take revenge, did you? Why not? What could you tell they were serving?

Now turn it around.

Think of a time when *you* contemptuously judged someone. Even if you tried to hide your contempt, they still dug in their heels, didn't they? And somewhere inside, that resistance confirmed what you already believed.

And finally, a time when you corrected someone with integrity yourself. Perhaps you had to do it with more ferocity; more violence than in the previous case—and yet something in you knew it would ultimately bring *more* peace. *How* did you know?

---

That time you stood in integrity, and the time the person who corrected you did: even if you knew nothing else about them—their politics, their religion, their creed—didn't it feel like you were somehow serving the same thing? What is that?

And the time you stood in contempt, and were treated with contempt: didn't it feel like *those* were somehow serving the same thing? Not just your personal egos, either.

Integrity feels clean from both the inside and outside.

Contempt feels righteous inside but dark, dirty, insincere from the outside.

There's a reason for that distinction—and seeing it clearly changed everything for me.

---
## How Contempt Works

Here's what I saw.

When I mock or shame my enemies and they dig in, my response is mixed. On one level, I feel dismayed: *damn, they really are as bad as I feared*. But on another, I feel a certain satisfaction: *see, they really are as bad as I feared!*

Did I go into it expecting this satisfaction? Of course not—that would make me a bad person!

And yet, when you're on the receiving end, you somehow feel it, don't you? That I want to prove how bad you are, even while I claim I'm only trying to help?

*Of course* there was a part of me that wanted this outcome, even as I did it—I just couldn’t admit it to myself. I'd like to call it "unconscious," but that's not quite right. It was just in limbo.

And lo and behold: it worked: my *hidden intention* for you to dig in was enough to bring it about. 

But how? Really pause and reflect on this. How did you perceive something in me that I barely knew myself—unless *part of me was somehow showing it to you?*

Now, I want to be clear about this: it's not that I *consciously* wanted you to see it in the usual sense of that word. Except here's the thing: the medicine showed me exactly where this knowledge had been lurking in my conscious mind the whole time. My desire for you to see it **was** conscious—it was just more deeply hidden than my mere hope that you'd dig in.

And it gets worse.

Anyone who's been on the receiving end of contempt knows that this will be the result—that it makes us feel worse. So we also know it on the delivering end—it's just more deeply hidden. Part of me (consciously) knew in advance it was going to work, and I did it anyway. Doesn't that sound like an *intention*?

Moreover, don't I already know there's a way to correct people that *doesn't* cause this to happen?

So what did my contempt *add*, exactly?

Your digging in wasn't accidental, and it wasn't just an unfortunate side-effect of my good intentions: **it was secretly the whole point.** I was just telling myself pretty stories about how good it would be—and buying them so completely that they became "true" for me.

Which meant that when you did dig in, I could use it against you. Because not only did you fight back against my righteous behavior—which only an evil person would do—you were implicitly accusing *me* of being the evil one. How *dare* you. This world is even worse than I thought—licensing me to ignore my conscience a little more. To fight for good, of course.

And in case you didn't see this coming: *part of me knew that, too. The whole thing was a fiendish ruse that would allow me to feel less guilty about disobeying my own conscience. That was the big payoff.*

Let that sit for a moment.

*Something in me revealed itself to you to license more darkness in me.*

And, to cinch the trap: part of me knows this, too—and it's so dark that I must **never** allow it into conscious awareness.

That's why we have no idea we're doing this.

---
## Plausible Deniability

It's difficult to unfold all the layers of this trap. Just to give you a taste: for me to hold it against you, I couldn't know that I caused it. But at the same time, there's no way for me to cause it without part of me knowing that I am.

There are two parallel (conscious) layers of mind operating simultaneously and semi-independently. The left hand doesn't know what the right is doing. One does the dirty work while the other is kept clean.

This is the origin of plausible deniability. It doesn't start in governments or organizations, but right here in the individual psychology of *good people.* The "dark operative" doing dirty work while the "official part" maintains innocence? That architecture doesn't get imposed top-down. It blossoms from the bottom up; the natural, inevitable result of millions of us doing exactly this.

And then what do we feel when we locate the people up top "responsible for it all?"

*Contempt.*

But we'll get to that later.

---
## Hall of Mirrors

We left one important question unanswered: _how_ did that part of me reveal itself to you—especially given that it was hidden from myself?

Imagine (if you will) being on the receiving end of a dehumanizing gaze. Can you feel how the person is somehow turned away from themselves—or perhaps away from the "Light"?

As we'll see later, it's impossible for me to do this without hiding something from myself—basically, your humanity. So I **cannot** wish harm or act selfishly without entering limbo—and that's what you see. 

**My limbo state is generally visible to you**—if only subconsciously. Notice how peculiar this is: hiding it from myself **is** what reveals it to you.

Now, malice alone may send a shudder down your spine, but it probably doesn't make you dig in. For that, an extra ingredient is necessary: the pretense of good. That pair is what contempt *is*.

This combination—malice with the pretense of good—is something we both instinctively recognize. Moreover, we both know that the *other* knows it, and that they know *that*, etc. It is thus what game theorists call *common knowledge.* (The reason for this will become clear later.)

Now, watch how that allows this game to unfold.

I'm hiding my malice while pretending it's good. But part of me knows you (correctly) recognize the pair as hypocrisy, which I must also hide from myself. But you now (correctly) recognize it as a ruse, which I must hide. So you now see it as a plausibly deniable ruse, which I must hide...

And the whole thing results in a kind of hall-of-mirrors effect. You feel it as a maddening sense of "we both know what I'm really doing, and that it cannot be proven from the outside—so I'll never be forced to admit it, even to myself." And **that** is what ultimately ensures you dig in.

It is the whole recursive structure of **hiding** of my true intention that **reveals** it[0].

You can also choose to look at it more simply: my willingness to turn away from my Light is what licenses you to do the same. Embracing my darkness empowers you to embrace yours.

Put another way: when you see me—a "good person"—ignoring my own conscience, you realize this world is even shittier than you thought, licensing you to ignore yours.

These are all equivalent formulations. In each case, part of me wanted you to see it—but since I "don't know" that, I see *you* as the bad one, giving me permission to do it more. It results in a downward spiral we're all familiar with.

---
## Hijacking Goodness

Now I don't just accuse you of being a *bad person* for no reason at all. It's (usually) because I see *you* being out of integrity in some way. I see something dark in you, and I feel compelled to attack it. Morally obligated.

I'm not just accusing you of doing something wrong. It's as if I perceive that darkness as being *inherent to your very nature*. And, having finally caught hold of this essence of *what's wrong with the world*, I'm not going to let it get away. I must punish it.

But in that moment, I cannot separate *it* from *you.* The sense of your inherent badness is somehow baked into my very perception of you. I don't just *think* you're bad—I *see* it; *feel* it. 

Now, I suspect your friends and allies don't see you this way—which means that it's *my own mind* altering my perception of you.

If it didn't—if I recognized you as a confused human like me—I might be able to understand you better and find a healthier (and more effective) way to stop or correct you.

Now, ask yourself: which part of me has an incentive to prevent me from seeing you like that? From giving in to my darkness? Might it be related to the part that lures me away from my conscience with clever rationalizations?

Of course it's the same part. This part of me—it manipulates both my thoughts *and* perceptions to draw me away from my Light. That's what makes it so insidious.

And after this interaction, won't I see you as even more surely defective, and vice versa? It now has a **tighter grip** on my mind—and yet I'm left feeling even *more* righteous; more confident than before. That sounds like a slippery slope.

Notice how it accomplished all this through hijacking a genuinely good trait: my desire to fight evil. And now I've given it more power over me, which means it can lead me even further from my Light next time.

---
## Thinking Your Way to Good

Similarly, when contemptuously judging bad people, it doesn't just *feel* righteous: you could probably prove that it *is.* (In fact, if this is your first time encountering this whole thing, you might have to re-read the earlier sections to remind yourself that *part of you already knows that it's not.*)

The problem isn't just that first initial thought / perception that lured you away from your Light. Once you're separated from it, your *whole cognitive apparatus* is unknowingly hijacked in service of your dark side—which means that you can't simply think your way out of it, no matter how careful you think you're being.

Have you ever tried to talk someone out of being evil? How well did that work?

And it's not a binary thing: separation from our Light happens along a continuum. Which means you might be in some version of it right now.

In fact, here's a simple test: is it possible for you to feel even a trace malice, contempt, or self-righteousness toward anybody for any reason? If so, your perception is being manipulated without your knowledge.

In fact, even if you were somehow free of those dark sentiments, there are still traces of it woven into your perception of reality itself. It's the reason humanity is so cavalier about ravaging nature. But we'll get to that later.

Remember: you already know how to stop bad behavior without contempt. You recalled doing so earlier. And whether fierce integrity is **always** sufficient or darkness is sometimes necessary: that's hard to answer right now—but notice there's a part of you that *needs* the latter to be true.

---
## Responsibility

You might call this process "unconscious" or "subconscious," and there's something to that. Jung would say this material was repressed into the shadow, genuinely hidden from awareness. 

But when the medicine took me back to a time I'd done this, as much as I resisted seeing it—*and believe me, I resisted*—it was there in consciousness, clear as day. I had **always known it,** but hadn't let myself see it.

This isn't semantic hairsplitting. If it's unconscious, I can tell myself "I'll deal with that later"—it's buried somewhere I can't access right now. If it's limbo, it's conscious. And when I know something consciously and do it anyway, it is **intentional**—I'm just turning away from it. Which means I have a profound responsibility to stop doing that. Right now.

So there is a sense in which it wasn't the real me—and a sense in which it absolutely was. I'll unpack that paradox later, but for now: I'm responsible either way.

---
## Summary

There's something in us that needs us to see our enemies as fundamentally defective, so that it can lure us into treating them in ways that make both of us worse.

This knowledge isn't unconscious; we've just buried it so deeply that it *feels* like we don't know it. And it needs us to feel that way, because otherwise we would feel the urgency of putting an end to it.

---
## Conclusion

By exposing the deepest layers of my mind, the medicine taught me this: I couldn't run from my lies forever. And the very idea that I could was the deepest lie of all.

But more importantly, it showed me *how much better* it feels when I don't have to. And how, the closer I get to my Light, I more I see that I never *wanted* to.

That's what I rob from you when I treat you with contempt: I'm nudging you a little further from the part of you that doesn't *want* to carry the burden of ignoring your Light.

---
## Interlude

Have you ever treated someone unkindly—perhaps mocking, shaming, or contemptuously judging them—only to discover later that you'd been unfair? That there was something about their story that rendered their behavior more understandable—even if not excusable—and how, if you'd known it at the time, you couldn't have been cruel?

Your perception of them shifted, right? Nothing changed about their outward appearance, and yet you *saw* something you hadn't before. A part of them that just wanted to be free of the pain.

And when you see that, you *can't help* but want to serve it. Not because you're especially noble, or because you calculated it would be "good," but because... it's just... obvious.

The person who corrected you with integrity: they were serving your Light; the *real you*—and they did that by refusing to accept your internal narrative about who you were in that moment; the *false* you. It's like they were reminding you of something you'd temporarily forgotten about yourself—but how?

And they weren't just serving you; they were serving something larger. How did they know these two would go hand in hand—that helping you *would* help the Whole? After all, you may have had different religions, politics, etc. 

And which *part* of them was serving you? In exactly the same way you can't win against your own conscience, didn't it feel like you couldn't win against that part? More importantly: did you even want to?

If they had chosen to treat you with contempt instead: which part of you would that have served? And would that have served the world?

Can you feel how the closer you get to your Light, the easier it is to see in others? It doesn't make you want to fight evil *less*. If anything, it makes you *more* protective of others—but you feel less need to inject your own darkness into it.

Where does this process stop?

## Footnotes

[0] Notice how bizarre this is: I made you lose a bit of faith in humanity by showing you that even the so-called "good people" (me) are willing to harm you for their own gain. But what was the actual harm? It was... showing you that good people are willing to harm you for their own gain.# Part II: The Infection

Then the medicine began to reveal more.

The darkness—I wasn't just spreading it through contempt for the "evil people."

---

At some point, I had begun to feel contempt for so many others—crazy people; stupid people; irrational people; bad drivers; you name it... all those morons ruining the world for good people like me.

It all felt so righteous—and it affected them all the same way. And not just them. The people around me. Why had I thought it was making them *better*?

Except I hadn't.

---

Sometimes other people's minds darkened in *resistance* to mine—those I felt superior _to_. But sometimes their minds darkened _alongside_ mine—those I felt superior _with_: my smart friends, political allies, etc.—bravely allied against the forces of stupidity, evil, etc.

We bonded over our contempt for our enemies. That self-righteous energy I stirred up... it felt almost like bloodlust. Why hadn't I noticed that before?

Except, of course, that I had. I had just been turned away from it.

Where did that dark energy go when we parted ways?

---

I watched as it rippled out to countless others.

A man I'd shamed—I watched him go home and take it out on his wife and kids. I knew I would never have to answer for that—let alone all the countless downstream effects as it spread through *their* networks.

In fact, if anything, I could use it as more proof that the world was dark, and desperately in need of my righteous anger.

Countless threads of darkness, weaving themselves into the world, in ways that could never be traced back to me.

---

I then saw that dark energy ripple out and reach an oil executive—exactly the kind of person I hated for destroying our precious planet. I watched as it tipped the balance on a crucial decision in the wrong direction. And I saw—unmistakably, unavoidably—the horrifying truth: my fingerprints were all over his decision.

I don't know how to put it any better than that. I'm not denying people agency. I'm not excusing anyone. Their choices are their own. And yet I watched, helplessly, as part of my very own hand signed that ink, sealing the fate on yet another ecological disaster.

All our contempt had subtly convinced him that *we* were the problem—those self-righteous assholes accusing him of evil even as they clawed over each other to choke down his product.

But even more strangely, I saw how that had secretly **been the point**. Just as when I mocked people face to face, I *wanted* him to sense my hypocrisy—because I knew it would nudge him closer to who I needed him to be to fit my tidy narrative. My darkness had reached him via much more convoluted channels, but it reached him all the same. I had somehow *relied* on it.

I was then shown the intense burden of his life; the hidden despair and abuse behind the squeaky clean image. Isn't that what it is to be human? 

I'd made his life just a tad bit worse, in ways that could never be linked back to me, just to prove he was inhuman.

And then, predictably, I used it to justify my own consumption; my unwillingness to change my habits.

The medicine wasn't asking me to forgive him. It was showing me how I'd used him—kept him trapped in his role so I could keep playing mine.

---

Then there was my general selfishness, hypocrisy, sense of superiority...

Angrily judging drivers for cutting me off, after I'd done the exact same thing.

Virtue signaling to remind myself how "good" I was, so that I didn't have to get my hands dirty and help out real people.

Calling it "sticking it to the man" when I was really justifying my own selfish behavior.

Calling people "sheeple." Subtly treating people as NPCs.

Even just carrying myself in a subtly superior way. Have you ever been in a room with someone like that? Doesn't it feel... dirty?

I wasn't directly harming anyone, so I didn't notice that I was almost constantly in a mild form of limbo—but I saw now that that's what it was. And it all subtly influenced people around me.

Even my "good deeds" were infected with subtle traces of ego. Projects that I could 100% *prove* would benefit the world, but that also "just happened" to benefit me. What a happy coincidence.

---

It's not actually possible to act selfishly without harboring some amount of contempt—the general sense that I'm somehow superior to others; more deserving. People feel that, and it licenses the same in them.

All of this subtly darkened the ambient environment, lowering the threshold for selfishness... which I would then, predictably, judge them for.

I thought I'd never have to answer for any of it.

---

All the benefits I was receiving from this behavior—were they worth all the darkness I was creating?

When I wasn't stopping to notice it, it certainly felt that way. This is just how the world works. Every man for himself. I wasn't doing anything that other people weren't. And look how much worse their behavior was! Those... oil executives, gleefully ruining our planet!

But when I was forced to confront it all?

*Fuck!*

It was a literal Faustian bargain. I didn't want this. I *couldn't* want it. A darker world in exchange for some personal benefit?

In that place, I saw it clear as day: the only way anyone *could* want this is by hiding the truth from themselves. From ignoring the full implications of their behavior, and the fact that other people were real, feeling humans like themselves. It requires active (but hidden) shielding.

And that's exactly what we were doing. Nearly all of humanity! We were all gleefully shoving each other deeper into the abyss! Shit!

Why had I never noticed this before?

But, of course... I had.

In that case, why was I still doing it?

---

Because I couldn't bear to face what was inside me.

Think back to that example in the prelude. That urge to make the "evil people" suffer, quite independent of any good it will do. Can you feel its texture? Set aside the question of whether it will accomplish good and just taste that raw quality. 

Can you taste how it's actually **pure malevolence**—the sheer essence of *all the evil there ever was*? Something hungry for pure, unbridled anguish. It's difficult to face, but that's what it is.

That lives in you. It lives in me.

That's what your enemy is recognizing in you when you feel contempt—and it's what that part of you **wants** them to feel. Because it knows this will make them reveal theirs, which will compel you to violently punish them for it.

I was taken back to countless moments where I'd done exactly that. Part of me—a *conscious* part—had always known I was leaking pure malevolence into the world in the name of justice. It was only by being forced to taste it—by not ignoring it—that I finally saw.

*All the darkness in the world... it's all made of the same stuff. The stuff I'd been gleefully spreading myself.*

The Nazis called their victims "vermin." The Tutsis, "cockroaches." All genocides—they're literally made of contempt. It's the dark engine that keeps evil running.

I wasn't just increasing the odds of selfish behavior in the people nearby. I was increasing the chances of **genuine atrocities** occurring in distant locations—places far away enough in time and space that I could point at the perpetrators and know, with complete certainty, that I had nothing to do with any of it. And what do you think I felt for them?

*Compassion?*

A deep part of me already knew all this. And it was doing everything in its power to cover it up.

But there was one thing in particular that was absolutely necessary to make it all work.

---

Evil people.

There had to be people who were not just different from me, but *inherently so.* Their evil had to be of a fundamentally different nature than mine—not just a worse version of it. That way, I'd always be able to explain why the world is so shitty, and be sure it had nothing to do with me. 

And I had to ensure that such people continued to exist. I especially had to make sure that none of them ever escaped from the dark place their minds were trapped—because what would it make me if they did?

It would prove that they were never fundamentally different from me. Which would mean I'd been keeping inherently redeemable people trapped in hell for my own benefit. It would mean that the blood of their victims was partially on my hands.

And that just couldn't be.

So some part of my mind had to ensure—absolutely *ensure*—that I could never see them as anything but pure evil.

---
## Shielding

Thinking back the Part 1 Interlude: do you remember how much more natural it feels to want to be of service to people than to harm them?

The desire to harm—including contempt—requires that you shield yourself from their humanity. It's not your natural condition. It's something your dark side **adds** your perception.

Can you imagine what it would be like if that shielding knob were turned up to its maximum?

You'd know what it's like to be evil.

Evil people don't do a different thing than the rest of us—theirs is just more extreme. They've been turned away from their Light so long that the very idea of such a thing feels insane.

But there's more.

## Parasite

Have you ever been so angry you didn’t care what it destroyed—as long as it made them _feel it_? In that moment, it felt like you. It felt like you were seeing more clearly than you ever had, right? And yet in retrospect, doesn't it feel like "*whoa, that wasn't me?*" It feels almost like *possession.*

When we turn away from our Light, we're turned away from ourselves—but *something* is still in control. And that "something" drives us to create a world we don't actually want—one in which people are more selfish, our enemies are dug in, etc.

This thing **needs** to stay hidden from me—for me to be in limbo—to survive.

It doesn't *feel* like me, until it takes over me—at which point it does, and pursues goals that benefit *it* but not the real me. What does that sound like?

It's a **parasite**. 

I have one, you have one. And when mine attacks you, it strengthens yours.

Our parasites aren't fighting—they're collaborating. Tricking us into *thinking* we're fighting as a way to gain more control over all of us.

And it's working.

The more often it takes control, the further our baseline state gets from the Light, and the less we remember that such a thing ever existed—and that it's the real us. The less power we have to rescue other people from theirs.

The more this happens, the more it takes over our whole identity—until one day it simply *is* us.

This is where the "evil people" are trapped. And as long as I'm not free of my parasite, I will feel the compulsion to keep them trapped there. And anyone who questioned this would be naive, stupid or... evil.

Before we go further, I need to address something: what do I mean by *parasite*?

## On the Metaphysics

I'm not claiming it's a *literal* parasite—at least, not in the sense most of us are used to. But I'm also not saying it's just a metaphor. There's something experientially precise here to discover, that I've found makes more sense of collective human behavior than other frameworks I've encountered. But I have no way of making it metaphysically precise.

I also don't think that's an accident. This thing survives by hiding in our blind spots—and trying to pin things down **always** creates blind spots. Let me give you some examples.

### Is it me?

If so, I'll become defensive when it's pointed out ("I'm not someone who would knowingly darken the world!"). I'll feel shame when I realize what I've done, preventing me from getting a closer look at it.

If not, then I'll absolve myself of responsibility for all the harm I've caused while under its sway.

### Is it you?

If so, why would I bother to look for any good in you? Harming you *is* harming it.

If not, I'll fail to act with the fierce resolve needed to actually stop you.

### Is it "real"?

If so, then (especially as I discover more of its bizarre cooperative behavior) I'll fall into age-old patterns. It's the Devil, and I'm God's (self-)righteous warrior. My team must win at any cost.

If not, then it's just psychology. I'll outsource the problem to science, never realizing that such abdication IS the problem.


Notice how every one of these lets it sneak in the back door. In fact—and this might be the deepest insight in this whole essay—the very origin of the parasite _is_ our desperate need to pin down reality—something impossible for any finite mind to do. But more on that later.

What I've found most useful is to bracket the whole issue and engage experientially. That said, the cleanest working model I have is: it **is** me, but not the **real** me.

For the rest of the book, I will switch between calling it your parasite / darkness / devil—or sometimes just "you." Context should make it clear what I mean.

# Part III

We now have all the setup we need to lay out our big-picture framework.

If any of the language is metaphysically unpalatable to you, feel free to substitute your own. In the end, it's the phenomenology that matters. And this can all be experientially verified, given enough time and patience.

## Outline

1. There are only two forces we can serve: Light and darkness. The Light is real, the darkness is not. Darkness is merely the absence of Light; our willingness to turn away from it.

2. The more turned away we are, the more that absence feels like a terrifying presence—and the more we feel compelled to viciously attack it in others. This only strengthens it.

3. The darkness is **impossibly** clever at imitating the Light. This is why so many "noble" projects end up causing harm.

4. The darkness in all of us is coordinating. This is what's destroying all life on Earth. It matches traditional descriptions of the Devil (so we'll actually call it that). [secret handshake reveal.]

5. The only thing that *actually* defeats darkness is the Light. This doesn't have to be soft or gentle. That's a lie the darkness tells to conceal the true power of the Light.

6. In every moment, we're serving one or the other. If we don't know which we're serving (e.g., we feel apathy or ennui), we're serving the darkness.

7. The Light isn't something I have; it's what I most fundamentally *am*. The more I remember, the more others do, too. As the Light fully remembers itself, the Devil is brought to its knees. This is my greatest purpose.
