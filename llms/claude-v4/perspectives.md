Need a clearer progression of perspectives

1. I'm in charge, using my goodness.
	a. To fight you and improve the world.
	b. To reveal your darkness, proving how bad you are.

2. I'm using my darkness.
	a. To fight yours / intimidate you (and improve the world).
	b. To provoke yours, so I can prove you're the bad one.
	c. To create more, to hide my own shadow.

3. The darkness is using me.
	a. To spread itself. "see, even the so-called good people..."

I'm purely good. I treat you with contempt to improve the world.

Okay, I'm trying to provoke you, because this proves how bad you are, which is good for the world.

Okay I'm using my darkness to intimidate you into stopping.

Okay fine, I'm using it to provoke yours and prove how bad you are.

I'm actually using it to create more darkness in the world, to hide my own.

Oh shit, it's using me to spread itself.
