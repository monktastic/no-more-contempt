## A Self-Fulfilling Prophecy

This part of me: it *needs* me to see the world as dark; to see (some) people as inherently defective—because how else would it justify its presence in my mind? How else would it compel me to viciously attack?

Now notice something astonishing about how it worked:

1. I have a deep, primal need to see other people as "what's wrong with the world."
2. This need is so dark I must hide it from myself, but so primal I can't help but reveal it to others.
3. That combination alone is enough to cause it.

It is a self-fulfilling prophecy. Its form **is** its function. Simply by existing, it spreads itself.
