# Chapter IV

We now have all the setup we need to lay out our big-picture framework.

If any of the language is metaphysically unpalatable to you, feel free to substitute your own. In the end, it's the phenomenology that matters. And this can all be experientially verified, given enough time and patience.

## Outline

1. There are only two forces we can serve: Light and darkness. The Light is real, the darkness is not. Darkness is merely the absence of Light; our willingness to turn away from it.

2. The more turned away we are, the more that absence feels like a terrifying presence—and the more we feel compelled to viciously attack it in others, thereby strengthening it.

3. The darkness is **impossibly** clever at imitating the Light. This is why we cannot simply reason our way to what is good / right at either the personal or civilizational scales.

4. The darkness in all of us is coordinating, destroying all life on Earth. Its behavior matches traditional descriptions of the Devil. It's what some call the "evil global conspiracy."

5. The only thing that can *actually* bring down the "Devil" is the Light. This doesn't have to be soft or gentle. That's a lie the Devil tells to conceal the true power of the Light.

6. In every moment, we're serving one or the other. If we don't know which we're serving (e.g., we feel apathy or ennui), we're serving the darkness.

7. The Light isn't something I have; it's what I most fundamentally *am*. The more I remember, the more my behavior naturally reminds others. As the Light fully remembers itself, the Devil is brought to its knees.
