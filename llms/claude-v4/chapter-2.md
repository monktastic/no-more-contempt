# Chapter II: The Contagion

Then the medicine began to reveal more.

The darkness—I wasn't just spreading it through contempt for the "evil people."

---

At some point, I had begun to feel contempt for so many others. Crazy people. Stupid people. Irrational people. Bad drivers. 

Why couldn't all these morons see how they were ruining the world? I'm not a cruel person, but it was my duty to make sure they felt it.

I then got to watch as the effects of my noble behavior rippled out.

---

That colleague I'd shamed last week—I saw how he went home and was short with his wife. She was less attentive to her students the next day—just when that one kid really needed it. My colleague was less gracious in traffic than normal, and that rippled through the other drivers.

I was the one who had set all that darkness in motion.

---

But it wasn't just the people I felt superior *to*; it was also those whom I felt superior *with*—my smart friends, my political allies, all of us bravely allied against the forces of stupidity and evil.

We bonded over our shared contempt for our enemies. That self-righteous energy we stirred up in each other... it tasted like *bloodlust*.

Why hadn't I noticed it before?

Where did that dark energy go when we parted ways?

---

The medicine showed me one thread in particular.

I saw an oil executive—exactly the kind of person I hated for destroying our precious planet. I watched as my contempt tipped the balance on a crucial decision in the wrong direction. My fingerprints were all over it.

All our contempt had subtly convinced him that *we* were the problem—those self-righteous assholes accusing him of evil even as they clawed over each other to choke down his product.

But even more strangely, I saw how that had secretly been the point. I *wanted* him to sense my hypocrisy—because I knew it would push him further into his role. The role I needed him to play so I could keep playing mine.

Then I felt what I'd been refusing to feel: that he was human. That whatever had led him here—ambition, fear, desperation, delusion—he was suffering his own version of the trap. Not evil incarnate. Just lost, like me.

I'd made his life a little bit worse, in ways that could never be linked back to me, just to prove he was the villain.

Then, predictably, I'd used that to justify my own consumption; my unwillingness to change my habits.

---

Then there was my general selfishness. My hypocrisy. My subtle sense of superiority. It all came through in how I carried myself.

Angrily judging drivers for cutting me off, after I'd done the exact same thing moments earlier.

Virtue signaling so I didn't have to get my hands dirty helping real people.

Calling people "sheeple." Treating people as NPCs. Blocking out their emotions.

Even my "good deeds" were infected with ego—projects that would benefit the world but also "just happened" to benefit me.

I wasn't directly harming anyone, so I didn't notice I was almost constantly in a mild form of limbo. And it all subtly influenced the people around me.

I saw that I couldn't act selfishly without feeling subtle contempt—that sense that I was somehow superior to others; more deserving. And people felt that. It licensed the same in them.

All of this subtly darkened the ambient environment, lowering the threshold for everyone's selfishness... which I would then, predictably, judge them for.

I thought I'd never have to answer for any of it.

---

All the benefits I was receiving from this behavior—were they worth the darkness I was creating?

When I wasn't stopping to notice it, it certainly felt that way. This is just how the world works. Every man for himself. I wasn't doing anything that other people weren't. And look how much worse *their* behavior was—those hypocrites!

But when the medicine forced me to confront it all?

*Fuck.*

A darker world in exchange for some personal benefit? It was a literal Faustian bargain. I didn't want this. I *couldn't*.

I saw how the only way anyone could want it is by hiding the truth from themselves. Ignoring the full implications of their behavior. Seeing the world as a collection of stuff to manipulate for their own benefit.

We were all doing this to some degree—and it all pulled others into the abyss. Why had I never noticed this before?

But, of course... I had.

I just hadn't been able to allow it into conscious awareness.

---

It's all connected. My contempt for bad drivers and the great evils of history—they aren't separate categories. They exist on a spectrum, and each one feeds all the others.

I was darkening the world in ways that could never be traced back to me, increasing the risk of genuine atrocities in distant locations... and then viewing their perpetrators with... what?

*Compassion?*

---

The medicine took me to two moments where I'd confronted people I "knew" to be evil.

In the first, I'd faced them with a fierce gaze that conveyed: *your behavior will not be tolerated.*

The second was almost the same—but woven through it was a hidden subtext: *this darkness is what you really are.*

And then, one level deeper: *And I will personally see to it that nobody will ever see it any other way.*

From the outside, nobody could have told the difference—at least, consciously. And if anyone had protested, I would have made them look foolish. But on some level, my target knew, I knew, and everyone else knew.

This is how the game is played. Evil people are a necessary sacrifice, to keep our own hands clean. They are the dumping ground for all our shadows.

---

You might think that's just me—that I was uniquely messed up, or that the medicine showed me something exaggerated.

But everything I saw is happening in you too. Let me show you how.

---

## Everyday Contempt

Any time you skirt your conscience—shaving off a little extra somewhere, cutting a corner you know you shouldn't—you're subtly lowering the threshold for others to do the same.

In a society where such behavior is normalized, isn't everyone more likely to ignore their conscience *in general*? To say "fuck it, why should I be the lone chump following my 'better nature'?"

We may not think of cutting corners as "darkness," but it relies on exactly the same mechanism—turning away from our better nature—and feeds the same part in others.

We also don't think of it as *contempt*, but can you sense how it carries the same flavor? You can only benefit yourself at the world's expense by treating others as subtly "less than"; by elevating yourself above them.

And this can be an incredibly subtle move. You've probably never literally thought of your partner as "inherently defective"—but who hasn't felt that flash of "what's *wrong* with you?" during a fight? What does that do to a person?

There's a reason contempt is the #1 predictor of divorce, and why divorces so often have that bitter feeling of scorched earth; total war. Why each side feels like the exclusive victim / hero, and has zero compunction sticking it to the evil other.

This thing... it's continually steering us toward various kinds of Armageddon.

Every one of these seemingly-unrelated behaviors—contempt for enemies, skirting conscience, contempt for partners—makes the world a bit darker, and makes us more cynical. And under those conditions, each of us is *more* likely to do all those things—not less.

---

## Collective Self-Deception

There's an especially insidious form this takes.

Have you ever been in a group where everyone was justifying something selfish as "sticking it to the man"? Maybe it was cutting corners because "the system is rigged anyway," or taking something because "they exploit us."

In that moment, didn't you feel something off? Like everyone knew this was just an excuse, but you were all maintaining plausible deniability together?

And didn't it feel... *easy?* Like the group made it easier to ignore your conscience than you could have managed alone?

Your parasites are all in on it together. Creating a shared field that lets each of you turn away from yourselves more completely while making it feel more righteous than you'd get alone.

This is the hall of mirrors at group scale. Everyone knows what's really happening. Nobody can name it. The collective limbo feels safer than individual limbo—strength in numbers.

And later? When "the man" inevitably senses the dishonesty and predictably pushes back with their own? What does everyone feel?

*"See? This proves how corrupt they are! We were right to fight back!"*

Never noticing that we created the very evidence we needed. The self-fulfilling prophecy, but collective.

---

Similarly, when you gather with your "allies" to foster contempt for your enemies behind closed doors—something about the energy of the room feels a bit "off," doesn't it? Your darkness recognizes it as a safe space to come out and play with the others.

Maybe you sense that "your team" is using the same dirty tricks you ruthlessly judge your enemies for—but do you dare speak up in the presence of that energy? You know you'll be excommunicated if you name what's happening, don't you?

But by whom—or *what?* Any one of these people, in different circumstances, might be safe to confide in. But as a group? There's a dark synergy there that's difficult to grapple with.

It's almost like your parasites are *conspiring*—yet there's no explicit coordination. In fact, any attempt to make it explicit would destroy the veil of plausible deniability that it requires. It's somehow operating in your shared blind spot; harnessing your shared intelligence.

And when you all walk away, and that temporary pattern dissolves, none of you will be consciously aware of the darkness you've injected into the world.

---

What would our world look like if this kind of "conspiracy" were happening all over the place, in countless seemingly-unrelated contexts, at every scale up to the civilizational? Water-cooler conversations. Locker room talk. Boardroom meetings. Political rallies. Military war rooms.

In every case, an aspect of each participant's mind knows exactly what's going on—which we understandably judge them for. But instead of responding in a way that brings this misbehavior to light, our own darkness finds clever ways to help it remain hidden—because that part of us doesn't actually want it to end. It *needs* it, to serve as cover for itself.

---

## The Scale

Helpless animals being brutalized in factory farms. Prison inmates subjected to inhumane conditions. Corporations plundering nature for profit. Can you feel how each of these requires the same fundamental "turning away"? People must overlook the life; the sacredness in others, to enable them. And each becomes more frictionless in a darker, more cynical world.

Greedy bankers. Corrupt politicians. Hypocritical CEOs. Doesn't their dirty work get easier in a world mired in darkness?

The Nazis called their victims "vermin." The Tutsis, "cockroaches." Every genocide depends on contempt to twist regular people into monsters.

The aspect of mind that makes it feel righteous to dehumanize you—can you feel how it's the same mechanism as all the above, even if not on the same scale?

---

It's almost as if there's a life-denying, life-destroying force pushing us to the brink.

Have you ever felt that? How humanity has lost a certain sense of wonder, of sacredness, of trust in the world and in each other? And how that warrants a kind of cynicism that makes it all worse?

Here's the deep truth I experienced on the medicine that I still struggle to communicate.

My darkness cannot be cleanly separated from yours—or from anyone else's. It's all intimately connected.

When our parasites coordinate in groups, they're not *linking up*—they're revealing their shared nature. They were never separate to begin with. Your parasite isn't *yours*—it's a tendril of something far larger, operating through you.

On the trip, I saw it clearly: a singular distributed intelligence, weaving through all of us like mycelium through soil. Using our blind spots to communicate with itself. We are its nodes—the places where it surfaces into consciousness, just enough to act, but never enough to be seen.

It has a kind of uncanny intelligence—not thinking, but *adapting*. Evolving new strategies. Finding and exploiting our weaknesses. It leverages our human minds and forms to manifest itself in our world. And when it takes control of us, it feels like us, so that we never question it.

We each have our own way of relating to this thing. Christians call it the Devil. The Buddhists know it as the ego, or as Mara. It's the reason some of us believe in an evil global conspiracy. Or perhaps we just think of humanity as fundamentally selfish and greedy.

Each of these highlights certain aspects of it, and obscures others. Its full nature resists being pinned down—and there's a reason for that.

Every time we try to understand it, we find ourselves standing outside of it. Analyzing it. Fighting it. Which makes us feel like we're uniquely immune to it, and other people are the problem.

We never realize that this very feeling only ever originates *from* it, and only reinforces it. It *is* it.

That feeling of being the noble one fighting the conspiracy **is** the conspiracy.

---

## Why We Can't Think Our Way Out

It **is** possible to see this at work in your own mind, and to evict it. In fact, every major wisdom tradition has been attempting to help us do just that. The problem is, the poetic language they often use to gesture at it is lost on the modern mind.

That's not a coincidence.

The aspect of mind that can detect the infection can only do so because it's fundamentally immune to it. It doesn't use language and reason—aspects that are easily corrupted by the parasite.

Think about it: if the parasite—or the "Devil"—wanted to prevent us from discovering the one aspect that could defeat it, what would be its smartest move?

It would be to make us rely entirely on intellect and rationality—to hold them as paragons of virtue. To make us fetishize them to the exclusion of all else. Only *they* can tell us what is good.

That way, when part of us tried to warn us—the part that *knows*—we would write it off as naive. After all, if it knows so much, why can't it *prove* it? Why isn't it talking?

True goodness would increasingly feel like a myth—not because it is, but because we're increasingly turned away from it.

---

The reason your integrity and mind seem aligned in some sense that goes beyond our particulars, is that we both recognize it as that-which-dispels-the-darkness—our shared foe.

In the same way we can conceive of the darkness as a singular force, there's a certain elegance in thinking of our "inner light"—this aspect of ourselves beneath the parasite—as being aspects of a common thing.

Look at it this way: the reason it pains me to hurt you is that I can kind of visualize myself *being* you. It's like the same thing that looks out my eyes also looks out yours. And whatever that thing is, it doesn't want to hurt.

You don't need to take this as a metaphysical fact, but feel the essence of it. That "thing" doesn't have any distinguishing characteristics—all such characteristics belong to your individual person.

In this way, it's not just the same *kind* of thing we share, but almost like the same *thing.*

There's a reason for that, which we'll revisit later. For now, it may help explain why I sometimes call this aspect of myself "my Light" or "*the* Light." "The" emphasizes this commonality, and the capitalization is because it's more fundamental than the darkness.

---


Here's the core problem: the more unmoored I become from my Light, the less I'm able to notice that I am. Isn't that true?

Correcting with integrity feels "righteous," and violently punishing evil feels "righteous"—but they don't feel the same at all, do they?

How can one word have two nearly-opposite meanings?

It wouldn't have mattered if someone had warned us. Any way we try to define or pin down "goodness," the darkness will usurp it for its own purposes.

Reasoning can be used in service of the Light—obviously. But the more my cognition is hijacked by my darkness—a condition I can't identify by thinking harder about it—the more I tell myself *stories* of how good my agendas, ideologies, projects are; and the more I believe them.

This is the condition that nearly all of humanity is lost in—and we will not think our way out of it.

There was only *one thing* that could warn me that my contempt would darken the world, and my thinking mind wrote it off as naive or "mere intuition" because it had no way to justify itself.

What would happen if all of humanity wrote off this part of ourselves as mysticism or "woo," fetishizing rationality and intellect above all else? If that became our dominant worldview?

What would the world look like then?

The biosphere isn't collapsing because we're not thinking hard enough. It's collapsing because we've convinced ourselves that thinking harder is enough to save it.
