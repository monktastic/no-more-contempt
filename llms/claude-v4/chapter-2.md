# Chapter II: The Infection

Then the medicine began to reveal more.

The darkness—I wasn't just spreading it through contempt for the "evil people."

---

At some point, I had begun to feel contempt for so many others—crazy people; stupid people; irrational people; bad drivers; you name it... all those morons ruining the world for the rest of us.

It all felt so righteous—and it affected them all the same way. And not just them. The people around me.

Why didn't I realize how my behavior was affecting them? Except, of course, that part of me secretly did.

---

The medicine began to open boxes I'd been too afraid to open.

That colleague I'd shamed last week. I watched him go home and be short with his wife, who was less attentive to her students the next day—just when that one kid really needed it. I watched how he'd been less gracious in traffic than normal, and how that rippled out through all the other drivers.

I was the one who had set all that darkness in motion.

---

Sometimes other people's minds darkened in _resistance_ to mine—those I felt superior _to_. But sometimes their minds darkened _alongside_ mine—those I felt superior _with_: my smart friends, political allies—bravely allied against the forces of stupidity, evil, etc.

We bonded over our contempt for our enemies. That self-righteous energy I stirred up... it felt almost like bloodlust.

Where did that dark energy go when we parted ways?

---

I watched as countless threads of darkness wove themselves into the world. 

Traces of it reached an oil executive—exactly the kind of person I hated for destroying our precious planet. I watched as it tipped the balance on a crucial decision in the wrong direction. And I saw—unmistakably, unavoidably—the horrifying truth: my fingerprints were all over his decision.

And yet I watched, helplessly, as part of my very own hand signed that ink, sealing the fate on yet another ecological disaster.

All our contempt had subtly convinced him that _we_ were the problem—those self-righteous assholes accusing him of evil even as they clawed over each other to choke down his product.

But even more strangely, I saw how that had secretly **been the point**. Just as when I mocked people face to face, I _wanted_ him to sense my hypocrisy—because I knew it would nudge him closer to who I needed him to be. My darkness had reached him via much more convoluted channels, but it had reached him all the same.

I was then shown the intense burden of his life; the hidden despair and abuse behind the squeaky clean image. Isn't that what it is to be human?

I'd made his life just a tad bit worse, in ways that could never be linked back to me, just to prove he was inhuman.

And then, predictably, I used it to justify my own consumption; my unwillingness to change my habits.

The medicine wasn't asking me to forgive him. It was showing me how I'd used him—kept him trapped in his role so I could keep playing mine.

---

Then there was my general selfishness, hypocrisy, sense of superiority...

Judging drivers for cutting me off, after I'd done the exact same thing.

Virtue signaling so I didn't have to get my hands dirty helping real people.

Calling people "sheeple." Treating people as NPCs; blocking out their emotions.

Even my "good deeds" were infected with ego—projects that would benefit the world but also "just happened" to benefit me.

I wasn't directly harming anyone, so I didn't notice I was almost constantly in a mild form of limbo. And it all subtly influenced the people around me.

---

I saw that I couldn't act selfishly without feeling subtle contempt—that sense that I was somehow superior to others; more deserving. And people felt that. It licensed the same in them.

All of this subtly darkened the ambient environment, lowering the threshold for selfishness... which I would then, predictably, judge them for.

I thought I'd never have to answer for any of it.

---

All the benefits I was receiving from this behavior—were they worth the darkness I was creating?

When I wasn't stopping to notice it, it certainly felt that way. This is just how the world works. Every man for himself. I wasn't doing anything that other people weren't. And look how much worse their behavior was! Those oil executives, gleefully ruining our planet for profit!

But when I was forced to confront it all?

_Fuck!_

A darker world in exchange for some personal benefit? It was a literal Faustian bargain. I didn't want this. I _couldn't_ want it.

In that dark place, I saw it clear as day: the only way anyone _could_ want this is by hiding the truth from themselves—ignoring the full implications of their behavior, ignoring that other people were real, feeling humans like themselves. It requires active (but hidden) shielding.

And that's exactly what we were doing—shoving each other into the abyss.

Why had I never noticed this before?

But, of course... I had. So why was I still doing it?

---

Because I couldn't bear to face what was inside me.

Think back to that example in the prelude. That urge to make the "evil people" suffer, quite independent of any good it will do. What *is* it?

Can you taste its texture? Set aside the question of whether it will accomplish good and just taste that raw quality.

It's **pure malevolence**—the sheer essence of _all the evil there ever was_. Something that feeds on pure, unbridled anguish.

_All the darkness in the world... it's all made of the same stuff._

And it lives in you. It lives in me.

That's what your enemy is recognizing in you when you feel contempt. And it **wants** them to recognize it. Because it knows this will make them reveal theirs, which will compel you to violently punish them for it.

Part of me—a _conscious_ part—had always known I was leaking this into the world in the name of justice.

---

It's all connected. My contempt for bad drivers and the great evils of history—they aren't separate categories. They exist on a spectrum, and each one feeds all the others.

The Nazis called their victims "vermin." The Tutsis, "cockroaches." All genocides—they're literally made of contempt. It's the dark engine that keeps evil running.

I was darkening the world in ways that could never be traced back to me—then pointing at distant atrocities and viewing the perpetrators with... what? 

_Compassion?_

---

But what hurt the most... what hurt the goddamn most... was realizing this:

**It had all been the point.** Not accidental. Not a side-effect of my good intentions. The whole point.

I struggle to write this even now.

That colleague—had he deserved the shaming? In a way, yes—and it _had_ brought more order to the team. But that benefit had been secondary. My darkness had seized on it as an opportunity to inject itself into that interaction, recognizing it as a way to spread itself into the world—where I could safely judge it from afar.

The darker world had made my own darkness easier to hide—both from myself and others.

_That_ was why I judged others. Not just to avoid confronting my own complicity in the world's ills, but to actively darken their minds—to make them do it more, making mine harder to detect. And they subconsciously knew this, making them dig in, fulfilling my clever prophecy.

But the whole ruse depended on one crucial lynchpin.

## Evil people

It wasn't enough for the world to be filled with mostly-good people who occasionally messed up—like me.

For the world to make sense, there had to be people who were _inherently_ different. Their evil had to be of a fundamentally different *nature* than mine—not just a worse version of it. That way, I'd always be able to look at the horrifying state of the world and be sure it had nothing to do with me. 

So I had to ensure that such people continued to exist—and especially had to make sure that none of them ever escaped from the dark place their minds were trapped.

Because what would it make me if they did?

It would prove they had *never* been fundamentally different from me. Which would mean I'd been keeping inherently redeemable people trapped in hell for my own benefit. That the blood of their victims was partially on my hands.

And that just couldn't be.

So what did I do? I created them. I kept them trapped there. All while patting myself on the back for how _righteous_ I was being. 

And it didn't even require overt cruelty. 

---

The medicine showed me how I'd done this. It took me back to two nearly-identical moments where I'd faced down people whom I "knew" to be evil.

In the first, I'd confronted them with a fierce gaze that conveyed something like: *your behavior will not be tolerated.*

The second was almost the same—but woven through it was a hidden subtext: *this darkness is what you really are, and what you will always be.*

And then, one level deeper: *And I will personally see to it that nobody will ever see it any other way.*

It was like a commitment to never recognize any trace of good that might remain in them. As if they had chosen their team, and now they were going to wallow in it.

From the outside, nobody could have told the difference—at least, consciously. And if anyone had protested, I would have made them look foolish. But on some level, my target knew, I knew, and everyone else knew.

This is how the game is played. Evil people are a necessary sacrifice, to keep our own hands clean. We're just not ready to touch that thought with a ten-foot pole.
