Why do I disobey my conscience? I'm a fundamentally decent person. I actually *want* to obey it—life feels lighter that way—but sometimes it's hard. I'm scared. Afraid the world won't be able to meet my needs. Just look at how awful people are! All the greed, the cruelty, etc.

So when I do something wrong and people treat me with contempt—as though I'm inherently morally defective—it hurts. But more than that, I'm angry, because they're hypocrites. They know it's cruel, but are pretending it's righteous. I felt licensed to skirt my conscience more.

Then the medicine showed me all the times I'd shown contempt. Mocking, shaming, judging my enemies. While I was doing it, part of me knew that I was doing exactly the thing I hated others for doing to me. But mine always felt justified in the moment. The people I were judging actually deserved it, unlike me.

I was shown their perspective, and how it licensed them to disobey their conscience more. They then spread more harm themselves, in a ripple effect.

Hadn't I always known this? So why did I keep doing it?

It wasn't just because I couldn't help myself.

It's because

The reason I skirt my conscience is because the world is dark.
No. The *real* reason I skirt my conscience is that I'm bad.
No. The *real* reason I skirt my conscience is that I'm bad at recognizing the temptation mechanism. 


Your Light is also the thing that lets you know whether you're connected to your Light. So the further you drift from it, the less you're able to notice that you are. It hasn't actually gotten quieter, you're just less able to hear it.

Being at home with your Light is the most inherently satisfying thing possible. Even if I were a "bad person," there's no way I couldn't want this. It's Home. The place before all the struggle began.

Knowing whether I've been distracted from the Light is a skill, not a moral issue (because again, I couldn't actually want the fake thing if I could remember the real thing, no matter how "bad" I was). All morality lies downstream from this one skill: if you lack it, you can go arbitrarily off the rails.

But it sure *feels* like a moral issue, doesn't it? Like, even if someone *has* a conscience, sometimes they just *choose* to ignore it, right? No, the temptation mechanism is just stronger (and it feeds on their fear, pain, insecurity, etc.) and/or they have less skill at recognizing it.

When you're far from your Light, I can see it in your eyes. And for some reason, the temptation mechanism in my mind goes wild. I *know* that treating you with contempt is cruel, but it feels so fucking righteous in the moment. And what does it actually accomplish? It makes you see the world as darker, which strengthens *your* temptation mechanism.

Huh, that's funny: it's as if my temptation mechanism is *strengthening* yours. And it actually sought you out for that very reason.

Oh, and it also makes me foment contempt amongst allies. That strengthens their temptation mechanism, too.

This mechanism doesn't just tempt me with thoughts, it literally modifies my perception. I see certain people as "bad" so that I can't help but attack them.

Oh, it's the same mechanism that enables genocides: a kind of darkening of perception.

Oh and huh, our temptation mechanisms don't really differentiate the kind of harm they cause in the world. So I strengthen yours, and that ripples out, strengthening genocides.

Wait a minute—I don't fucking want genocides. What's going on here?

Oh, shit, this mechanism—it's not my friend. It was giving me so many gifts (all the ways I help myself to a little extra) but the whole time, it's been darkening the world I love so dearly! The world that I'd fight to the death to protect when I'm near my Light!

I wonder if this is happening for other people...

OH, SHIT. What would they be like if they were abiding by their Light? They wouldn't be bad! I've been shoving people further from their Light and calling it righteous! What kind of person am I?!

Guilt, shame...

Wait, those are just fancier ways to separate me from my Light! They prey on my deepest morality!

I feel most Me when I'm standing by my Light. This thing tempting me is really not me. And that's not an excuse.

You ARE your Light. (experiential test) It's Home.

When presented with a temptation (justification), there's no essence of "badness" that determines whether you'll give in or not. Badness is what it looks like *after* you've taken the justification.

Receiving contempt has never once made me a better person. It has only convinced me to ignore my conscience *more.*

So I kind of already know that my contempt does the same to you—and that you'll pass on that darkness, in a ripple effect. But I can't help myself when I see you, because you're... bad.

But I don't actually want to create a shittier world! (Are you sure?) Oh shit, I AM my Light!

And because I know my contempt had the same effect on you, I know you have one too—and that it IS the "real you."

So why did I think you didn't? Oh, what limbo looks like from the outside is... evil. It's literally in my perception. And when I see that, I feel morally compelled to attack.

Put another way: when I see your tempter, I see you as *inherently bad*—not someone with a conscience who sometimes falls to their tempter like me, but someone who either doesn't have a conscience or else *wants* to fall for their tempter.

And then I strengthen yours. Or more accurately, my tempter—which isn't me—strengthens yours—which isn't you.

Wait, why are these things-that-aren't-us strengthening each other?

What do they do in other people? Dim perception: inmates, farm animals, etc.
