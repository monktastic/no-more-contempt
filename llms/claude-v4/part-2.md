# Part II: The Infection

Why did I need to believe my enemies were fundamentally defective?

Because if they weren't—if they were fundamentally decent but confused people like me—then I might begin to suspect that the horrifying problems of the world weren't all someone else's fault. That the darkness out there wasn't really of a different nature than my own—that I'd been continually pumping out into the world.





I watched helplessly as an enemy I'd shamed went home and took it out on his wife and kids. I knew I'd never have to answer for that—much less for the countless ripple effects it created.

Didn't I already know this is how it worked?

Of course I did. And that's why I had done it.

---

The darkness I was creating—it changed shape through each interaction





---
---

My contempt—it wasn't just for "evil" people. I wielded it against crazy people; stupid people; irrational people; bad drivers... all those morons ruining the world.

It all felt so righteous—and it affected them all the same way.

And not just them. The people around me.

I watched as that toxicity spread. That guy I flipped off—how it affected his behavior at home, and then spread to his kid's school, ...

Countless threads of darkness, weaving themselves into the world, in ways that could never be traced back to me.

---

It didn't spread only when I was in direct interaction with people. A subtle sense of superiority came through just from the way I carried myself, spreading darkness wherever I went.

I could see it in how people responded to me. Something would shift when I walked into a room—barely perceptible, but there. People would tense slightly, close off, become more guarded. Not because I'd said anything. Just from... something I was emanating.

And then I saw it from the other side. Times when someone walked into a room and _I'd_ tensed up. Felt that subtle defensiveness rise without knowing why. They hadn't done anything—but something in how they carried themselves, some faint whiff of superiority or judgment, and I was already resisting them. Already hardening.

It wasn't in their words. It wasn't even in their face. It was something underneath. And I could feel it as clearly as if they'd spoken it aloud.

Which meant they could feel mine too.

_Oh god. They'd always been able to._

---

Then there was the hypocrisy.

That time I'd angrily judged a driver for cutting me off, when I'd done the exact same thing the day before. I had a good excuse; he was just an asshole.

Virtue signaling to remind myself how "good" I was, so that I didn't have to get my hands dirty and help out real people.

And best of all: blaming other people when they felt contempt for *me.*

---

Sometimes other people's minds darkened in *resistance* to mine—those I felt superior _to_. Sometimes their minds darkened _alongside_ mine—those I felt superior _with_: my other smart friends, political allies, etc.—bravely allied against the forces of stupidity, evil, etc.

Have you ever bonded with allies over contempt for the enemy? Can you feel the... almost bloodlust... being fomented? Where does that dark energy go when you part ways? It doesn't just magically vanish. It leaks into everything, invisibly, inevitably. Into all areas of life.

I wasn't directly harming anyone, so I didn't notice that I was constantly in a mild form of limbo—but I saw now that that's what it was. There's no other way a person can carry themselves like that. I _knew_ it was darkening the field around me—but who could prove such a ridiculous claim? So what reason did I have to stop?

When people met me with that same energy—confrontational, "I'm going to put you in your place"—I just used it as an excuse to dig in more. Darkness feeding darkness. Didn't they know that's what would happen? Of course they did. Fuck 'em.

---

Part of me *knew* each of these behaviors subtly degraded the world—but I also knew that I'd never have to answer for any of it. The world is already shitty—who would even notice my contribution? And anyway, it was nothing compared to what the *actual* bad people do.

Seriously, fuck those guys.

---

I saw that energy ripple out and reach an oil executive—exactly the kind of person I hated for destroying our precious planet. I watched as it tipped the balance on a crucial decision in the wrong direction. And I saw, unmistakably, unavoidably, the horrifying truth: my fingerprints were on that decision.

I don't know how to put it any better than that. I'm not denying people agency. I'm not excusing anyone. Their choices are their own. And yet I watched, helplessly, as part of my very own hand signed that ink, sealing the fate on yet another ecological disaster.

I saw how all our contempt had subtly convinced him that *we* were the problem—those self-righteous assholes blaming him even as they gorged on his product.

But even more strangely, I saw how that had secretly **been the point**. Just as when I mocked people face to face, I *wanted* him to sense my hypocrisy—because I knew it would nudge him closer to who I needed him to be to fit my tidy narrative. It had reached him via much more convoluted causality, but it reached him all the same. I had *relied* on it.

I was then shown the intense burden of his life; the hidden despair and abuse behind the squeaky clean image. Isn't that what it is to be human? 

I'd made his life just a tad bit worse, in ways that could never be linked back to me. And then, predictably, I used it to justify my own consumption; my unwillingness to change my habits.

The medicine wasn't asking me to forgive him. It was showing me how I'd used him—kept him trapped in his role so I could keep playing mine.

---

And here's what made it so insidious: most of the time, I didn't even recognize it as contempt. Calling people "sheeple"? That was just stating facts. Seeing most people as NPCs? I mean, they kinda were.

And then all the darkness I spread through "innocuous" jokes.

"Darwin awards!" when someone died in an easily-preventable way.

"Play stupid games, win stupid prizes!"

"Fuck around and find out."

Every time, a subtle relish, satisfaction in the suffering of others—and an invitation for people to join me in it: *Look at how weak and stupid other people are. Don't waste your precious energy on them...*

I really *was* smarter than most of those people. So what if I correctly recognized it?

---

Then the trip zoomed out.

Wars happening on the other side of the planet. Atrocities I couldn't begin to fathom.

*How had I never seen it before? It was all made of the same stuff.*

The Nazis had called their victims "vermin." The Tutsis, "cockroaches." Every genocide, enabled by the very same thing: *contempt.*

The very thing I was busy pumping out into the world to prove how noble I was. How different, how special. After all, I was only doing it to people who *deserved* it.

The whole time, I'd been raising the baseline level of contempt in the world, making those things more likely to happen.

And then, when they did? What do you think I felt for the perpetrators?

Compassion?

---

*But why had I done all this?*

*Why was I **still** doing it? I **knew**. I fucking **knew** what I was causing. Enabling.*

*And that's exactly why I had to keep doing it.*

Think about it: when part of you *knows* you have complicity in all the world's ills, and you're not ready to face something that insanely dark—what do you do? Do you stop?

No. You cover it up—by doing it **more**.

You *ensure* that bad things keep happening, so the attention stays off you.

---

I knew I had helped create the conditions under which such choices became natural. A darker shittier world where we each have to look out for ourselves. In which others aren't trying to see us in our full humanity. Where we all reduce each other to cardboard cutouts; props in our moral theater, where we're the brave noble souls, on a mission to defeat the evil out there.

I knew such a world would help me hide my own complicity. In exactly the same way I knew that mocking my enemy would license more, I knew that these subtle field effects would, too—and they'd be more invisible; easier to hide.

I was darkening the entire ambient field—just to keep my own darkness hidden.

The medicine showed all this gently. I don't think my psyche would have survived it otherwise.

It was like part of me was orchestrating all of this with impossible cleverness. Knew exactly how to create the conditions I needed. Same effect, longer distance, harder to detect.

My fear around money—I saw how it wove itself into my surroundings, nudging people toward being the greedy people I always knew they were. That oil exec flashed in my mind again. Same energy, different form.

My contempt. My fear. Their greed. Their violence. All the same darkness. All feeding the same pool.

But there was one more thing left to see.

---

The evil people.

You ensure that "evil people" continue to exist, so that you always have a way to explain why the world is so shitty.

And you make **damn** sure that none of those people escape from the dark place their minds are trapped—because what would it make you if they ever did?

The very fact that they *could* escape would mean they were never fundamentally different from you.

Which would mean you've been keeping inherently redeemable people trapped in hell for your own benefit.

That the blood of their victims is partially on your hands.

So the horrors of the world **must** be caused by something inherently alien to us—by inherently evil people who we could never hope to fix; only to viciously fight.

And some part of our mind would have to ensure—absolutely *ensure*—that we could never see it any other way.

---

[Need a better transition, because we're in a really dark place.]

I lingered in that hell for a long time, unable to face myself.

I'd been so sure the good I was doing.

But it was all fucking bullshit.

"*All of it?*" the medicine gently prodded.

---

I was taken back to a faint memory. A time when I'd been corrected in a way that actually made a difference. I'd been put in my place—but curiously, without a hint of that "I'm going to put you in your place" energy I'd always assumed was necessary. Instead, this person got absolutely nothing out of it—no satisfaction, no validation, no ego boost. But there was more to it than that.

She was angry at what I'd done. But she was correcting me TOWARD something, not just punishing me for being defective. She refused to give up on me. Even in her anger. Like the behavior was foreign to my nature, not proof of it.

Through the fierceness of her tone and gaze—or maybe more like integrated with it—was something that pierced straight through my defenses. She wasn't looking at the part of me that had fucked up. She was looking _past_ it, to something deeper. Something I'd forgotten was there.

The part that existed before the limbo state. Before the infection. The part that had never wanted to do wrong—that never _could_ want to.

And in seeing it, she _reminded me it was still there_.

It felt something like:

> _Your darkness will not be tolerated. But you are welcome back into the Light whenever you choose._

I can't fully capture it in words, but I knew exactly what it was—like remembering something I'd buried so deep I'd convinced myself it was lost. It gave my own dark side absolutely nothing to latch onto, to justify itself to me—and I felt its grip weaken.

It's not that I didn't fight back—who likes losing face like that?—but I knew immediately I couldn't win. Just like you can't win a direct confrontation with your own conscience.

In fact, that's _exactly_ what it felt like: my own conscience, peering back at me through someone else's eyes.

---

And then I remembered: I'd offered this to others, too. Times I'd stood up for something with that same clean fierceness. No contempt underneath. No satisfaction in being right. Just unwavering clarity about what mattered.

It had felt completely different from the infected moments. Both would be called "righteousness"—but they couldn't be more different. I could _feel_ the difference when I was in it. When that person corrected me, I could _feel_ it in them.

In those clean moments—the fierceness with no contempt—I'd needed no calculation. But calculation was still okay there. Oh... *that's* what the medicine had been hinting me toward.

*That was the only time my calculations could be fully trusted.* The only time they weren't sullied by subtle rationalizations.

There was no way to figure out if I was in limbo by thinking harder about it. The whole cognitive apparatus was subtly compromised in a way that prevented detection. That's what made it so insidious: the deeper in I went, the more certain I was that I wasn't.

---

That's how the darkness had gotten me. I'd embraced my _ideas_ of right and wrong—my moral positions, my justified contempt, my righteous causes. And I'd abandoned the part of me that actually *knew* the difference between acting from light and acting from darkness.

That's what the limbo state was: a way to disorient me so I couldn't tell what was what. So I couldn't trust my own perception of right and wrong. So I'd have to rely on calculation instead—which was exactly what kept me trapped.

The clean moments had felt like _me_. More me than anything else. No justifications, no hiding necessary. The infected moments—those felt like something else. Something foreign to my nature. Somehow simultaneously me and yet not. I desperately needed to know what it was.

But for now, the mushrooms let that question linger.

---

I had known the right way. The clean fierceness with no contempt. And I'd chosen the other way anyway. Used it to shove people deeper into darkness. Then judged them for being there.

And a part of me had known I was doing this, even as I did it. It had been buried so deeply I'd convinced myself it would never be exposed. Yet here it was, all spilling out.

Didn't I know this day would come? 

*God, I'd even fooled myself about that.*

I was the biggest hypocrite of all.
