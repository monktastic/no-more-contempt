# Part II: The Infection

Then the medicine began to reveal more.

The darkness—I wasn't just spreading it through contempt for the "evil people."

---

At some point, I had begun to feel contempt for so many others—crazy people; stupid people; irrational people; bad drivers; you name it... all those morons ruining the world for good people like me.

It all felt so righteous—and it affected them all the same way. And not just them. The people around me. Why had I thought it was making them *better*?

Except I hadn't.

---

Sometimes other people's minds darkened in *resistance* to mine—those I felt superior _to_. But sometimes their minds darkened _alongside_ mine—those I felt superior _with_: my smart friends, political allies, etc.—bravely allied against the forces of stupidity, evil, etc.

We bonded over our contempt for our enemies. That self-righteous energy I stirred up... it felt almost like bloodlust. Why hadn't I noticed that before?

Except, of course, that I had. I had just been turned away from it.

Where did that dark energy go when we parted ways?

---

I watched as it rippled out to countless others.

A man I'd shamed—I watched him go home and take it out on his wife and kids. I knew I would never have to answer for that—let alone all the countless downstream effects as it spread through *their* networks.

In fact, if anything, I could use it as more proof that the world was dark, and desperately in need of my righteous anger.

Countless threads of darkness, weaving themselves into the world, in ways that could never be traced back to me.

---

I then saw that dark energy ripple out and reach an oil executive—exactly the kind of person I hated for destroying our precious planet. I watched as it tipped the balance on a crucial decision in the wrong direction. And I saw—unmistakably, unavoidably—the horrifying truth: my fingerprints were all over his decision.

I don't know how to put it any better than that. I'm not denying people agency. I'm not excusing anyone. Their choices are their own. And yet I watched, helplessly, as part of my very own hand signed that ink, sealing the fate on yet another ecological disaster.

All our contempt had subtly convinced him that *we* were the problem—those self-righteous assholes accusing him of evil even as they clawed over each other to choke down his product.

But even more strangely, I saw how that had secretly **been the point**. Just as when I mocked people face to face, I *wanted* him to sense my hypocrisy—because I knew it would nudge him closer to who I needed him to be to fit my tidy narrative. My darkness had reached him via much more convoluted channels, but it reached him all the same. I had somehow *relied* on it.

I was then shown the intense burden of his life; the hidden despair and abuse behind the squeaky clean image. Isn't that what it is to be human? 

I'd made his life just a tad bit worse, in ways that could never be linked back to me, just to prove he was inhuman.

And then, predictably, I used it to justify my own consumption; my unwillingness to change my habits.

The medicine wasn't asking me to forgive him. It was showing me how I'd used him—kept him trapped in his role so I could keep playing mine.

---

Then there was my general selfishness, hypocrisy, sense of superiority...

Angrily judging drivers for cutting me off, after I'd done the exact same thing.

Virtue signaling to remind myself how "good" I was, so that I didn't have to get my hands dirty and help out real people.

Calling it "sticking it to the man" when I was really justifying my own selfish behavior.

Calling people "sheeple." Subtly treating people as NPCs.

Even just carrying myself in a subtly superior way. Have you ever been in a room with someone like that? Doesn't it feel... dirty?

I wasn't directly harming anyone, so I didn't notice that I was almost constantly in a mild form of limbo—but I saw now that that's what it was. And it all subtly influenced people around me.

Even my "good deeds" were infected with subtle traces of ego. Projects that I could 100% *prove* would benefit the world, but that also "just happened" to benefit me. What a happy coincidence.

---

It's not actually possible to act selfishly without harboring some amount of contempt—the general sense that I'm somehow superior to others; more deserving. People feel that, and it licenses the same in them.

All of this subtly darkened the ambient environment, lowering the threshold for selfishness... which I would then, predictably, judge them for.

I thought I'd never have to answer for any of it.

---

All the benefits I was receiving from this behavior—were they worth all the darkness I was creating?

When I wasn't stopping to notice it, it certainly felt that way. This is just how the world works. Every man for himself. I wasn't doing anything that other people weren't. And look how much worse their behavior was! Those... oil executives, gleefully ruining our planet!

But when I was forced to confront it all?

*Fuck!*

It was a literal Faustian bargain. I didn't want this. I *couldn't* want it. A darker world in exchange for some personal benefit?

In that place, I saw it clear as day: the only way anyone *could* want this is by hiding the truth from themselves. From ignoring the full implications of their behavior, and the fact that other people were real, feeling humans like themselves. It requires active (but hidden) shielding.

And that's exactly what we were doing. Nearly all of humanity! We were all gleefully shoving each other deeper into the abyss! Shit!

Why had I never noticed this before?

But, of course... I had.

In that case, why was I still doing it?

---

Because I couldn't bear to face what was inside me.

Think back to that example in the prelude. That urge to make the "evil people" suffer, quite independent of any good it will do. Can you feel its texture? Set aside the question of whether it will accomplish good and just taste that raw quality. 

Can you taste how it's actually **pure malevolence**—the sheer essence of *all the evil there ever was*? Something hungry for pure, unbridled anguish. It's difficult to face, but that's what it is.

That lives in you. It lives in me.

That's what your enemy is recognizing in you when you feel contempt—and it's what that part of you **wants** them to feel. Because it knows this will make them reveal theirs, which will compel you to violently punish them for it.

I was taken back to countless moments where I'd done exactly that. Part of me—a *conscious* part—had always known I was leaking pure malevolence into the world in the name of justice. It was only by being forced to taste it—by not ignoring it—that I finally saw.

*All the darkness in the world... it's all made of the same stuff. The stuff I'd been gleefully spreading myself.*

The Nazis called their victims "vermin." The Tutsis, "cockroaches." All genocides—they're literally made of contempt. It's the dark engine that keeps evil running.

I wasn't just increasing the odds of selfish behavior in the people nearby. I was increasing the chances of **genuine atrocities** occurring in distant locations—places far away enough in time and space that I could point at the perpetrators and know, with complete certainty, that I had nothing to do with any of it. And what do you think I felt for them?

*Compassion?*

A deep part of me already knew all this. And it was doing everything in its power to cover it up.

But there was one thing in particular that was absolutely necessary to make it all work.

---

Evil people.

There had to be people who were not just different from me, but *inherently so.* Their evil had to be of a fundamentally different nature than mine—not just a worse version of it. That way, I'd always be able to explain why the world is so shitty, and be sure it had nothing to do with me. 

And I had to ensure that such people continued to exist. I especially had to make sure that none of them ever escaped from the dark place their minds were trapped—because what would it make me if they did?

It would prove that they were never fundamentally different from me. Which would mean I'd been keeping inherently redeemable people trapped in hell for my own benefit. It would mean that the blood of their victims was partially on my hands.

And that just couldn't be.

So some part of my mind had to ensure—absolutely *ensure*—that I could never see them as anything but pure evil.

## Shielding

Thinking back the Part 1 Interlude: do you remember how much more natural it feels to want to be of service to people than to harm them?

The desire to harm—including contempt—requires that you shield yourself from their humanity. It's not your natural condition. It's something your dark side **adds** your perception.

Can you imagine what it would be like if that shielding knob were turned up to its maximum?

You'd know what it's like to be evil.

Evil people don't do a different thing than the rest of us—theirs is just more extreme. They've been turned away from their Light so long that the very idea of such a thing feels insane.

But there's more.

---
## Parasite

Have you ever been so angry you didn’t care what it destroyed—as long as it made them _feel it_? In that moment, it felt like you. It felt like you were seeing more clearly than you ever had, right? And yet in retrospect, doesn't it feel like "*whoa, that wasn't me?*" It feels almost like *possession.*

When we turn away from our Light, we're turned away from ourselves—but *something* is still in control. And that "something" drives us to create a world we don't actually want—one in which people are more selfish, our enemies are dug in, etc.

This thing **needs** to stay hidden from me—for me to be in limbo—to survive.

It doesn't *feel* like me, until it takes over me—at which point it does, and pursues goals that benefit *it* but not the real me. What does that sound like?

It's a **parasite**. 

I have one, you have one. And when mine attacks you, it strengthens yours.

Our parasites aren't fighting—they're collaborating. Tricking us into *thinking* we're fighting as a way to gain more control over all of us.

And it's working.

---

The more often it takes control, the further our baseline state gets from the Light, and the less we remember that such a thing ever existed—and that it's the real us. The less power we have to rescue other people from theirs.

The more this happens, the more it takes over our whole identity—until one day it simply *is* us.

This is where the "evil people" are trapped. And as long as I'm not free of my parasite, I will feel the compulsion to keep them trapped there. And anyone who questioned this would be naive, stupid or... evil.

Before we go further, I need to address something: what do I mean by *parasite*?

## On the Metaphysics

I'm not claiming it's a *literal* parasite—at least, not in the sense most of us are used to. But I'm also not saying it's just a metaphor. There's something experientially precise here to discover, that I've found makes more sense of collective human behavior than other frameworks I've encountered. But I have no way of making it metaphysically precise.

I also don't think that's an accident. This thing survives by hiding in our blind spots—and trying to pin things down **always** creates blind spots. Let me give you some examples.

### Is it me?

If so, I'll become defensive when it's pointed out ("I'm not someone who would knowingly darken the world!"). I'll feel shame when I realize what I've done, preventing me from getting a closer look at it.

If not, then I'll absolve myself of responsibility for all the harm I've caused while under its sway.

### Is it you?

If so, why would I bother to look for any good in you? Harming you *is* harming it.

If not, I'll fail to act with the fierce resolve needed to actually stop you.

### Is it "real"?

If so, then (especially as I discover more of its bizarre cooperative behavior) I'll fall into age-old patterns. It's the Devil, and I'm God's (self-)righteous warrior. My team must win at any cost.

If not, then it's just psychology. I'll outsource the problem to science, never realizing that such abdication IS the problem.


Notice how every one of these lets it sneak in the back door. In fact—and this might be the deepest insight in this whole essay—the very origin of the parasite _is_ our desperate need to pin down reality—something impossible for any finite mind to do. But more on that later.

What I've found most useful is to bracket the whole issue and engage experientially. That said, the cleanest working model I have is: it **is** me, but not the **real** me.

For the rest of the book, I will switch between calling it your parasite / darkness / devil—or sometimes just "you." Context should make it clear what I mean.
