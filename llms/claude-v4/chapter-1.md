# Chapter I: Contempt
## Conscience

Have you ever done something you knew was wrong at the time, but couldn't fully admit it to yourself until later? Maybe you made a cruel comment to boost your ego, took credit for someone else's work, or cheated on a test (or even partner).

While you were doing it, wasn't one part of you—your conscience—telling you it was wrong, while another was busy producing justifications for why it wasn't *really* wrong?

Notice an asymmetry here: your conscience wasn't trying to justify itself. It just... *was*. The part providing justifications wasn't trying to convince *it*; it was trying to convince *you*—that your conscience was just one more voice among the noise.

But it isn't.

We *know* we can't win a direct confrontation with our conscience. All we can do is find better ways of ignoring it; of turning *away* from it.

So you did—and yet some part of you sensed this wouldn't end well, didn't it? 

---
## Limbo

You might have convinced yourself you didn't "really" know it was wrong, right up until you were able to admit it—at which point you saw that you *always had*.

Notice this: both halves—the undeniable wrongness and the conviction of rightness—were actually conscious **the entire time**. Not hidden in some unconscious realm waiting to emerge. Right there. You just kept your attention carefully turned away.

You were holding that knowledge in a "limbo state": a bizarre schism of mind in which we know something—*consciously*—and yet are **sure** we don't... until we retroactively discover that we always did.

It's a profound form of self-deception, but we don't do it because we're "bad people." We think we're protecting ourselves from a hostile world. When I do it, it feels like a necessary survival tactic. When you do it, it looks like character rot.

---
## Contempt and Integrity

Think back to a moment you felt contemptuously judged by another person. No matter how "right" they may have been; even if you *knew* you had done wrong, something felt *off* about them, didn't it? You could tell they weren't coming from a good place. How?

Now think of a time when someone set you straight with profound integrity—seemingly getting nothing out of it themselves. Even if it stung your ego; made you lose face, you had no desire to take revenge, did you? Why not? What could you tell they were serving?

Now turn it around.

Think of a time when *you* contemptuously judged someone. Even if you tried to hide your contempt, they still dug in their heels, didn't they? And somewhere inside, that resistance confirmed what you already believed.

And finally, a time when you corrected someone with integrity yourself. Perhaps you had to do it with more ferocity; more violence than in the previous case—and yet something in you knew it would ultimately bring *more* peace. *How* did you know?

---

That time you stood in integrity, and the time the person who corrected you did: even if you knew nothing else about them—their politics, their religion, their creed—didn't it feel like you were somehow serving the same thing? What is that?

And the time you stood in contempt, and were treated with contempt: didn't it feel like *those* were somehow serving the same thing? Not just your personal egos, either.

Integrity feels clean from both the inside and outside.

Contempt feels righteous inside but dark, dirty, insincere from the outside.

There's a reason for that distinction—and seeing it clearly changed everything for me.

---
## How Contempt Works

Here's what I saw.

When I mock or shame my enemies and they dig in, my response is mixed. On one hand, I feel dismayed: *damn, they really are as bad as I feared*. But on the other, there's a flicker of satisfaction: *see, they really are as bad as I feared!*

Did I go into it *expecting* to feel that satisfaction? Of course not—I'm not a bad person.

And yet, on the receiving end, you somehow feel it, don't you? That I want to prove how bad you are, even while I claim I'm only trying to help?

*Of course* I felt it while I was doing it. But it was a bit malicious, so I hid it from myself. It wasn't unconscious—**just in limbo**. That's why it feels like I didn't know.

Okay, so maybe I wanted this outcome—but it's not like I caused it. How would I even do that? "Hey you, dig in your heels so I can prove how evil you are!"

I would have to somehow make you see that I secretly wanted it, even as I myself believed I didn't. And I'm not nearly clever (or devious) enough to pull that off.

Except...

---

Have you ever been on the receiving end of a dehumanizing gaze? Doesn't the person seem somehow turned away from themselves, or perhaps from the "Light"? You can _feel_ the malice emanating from that state.

Contempt works the same way. I see you as fundamentally less than me, subhuman—the only difference being I'm also dressing it up as righteous.

I _know_ you can feel this.

By keeping it hidden from myself, I automatically accomplish both halves: showing it to you while appearing ignorant of it.

---

The unconscious mind does not perpetrate ruses this precise. This was conscious. But it was so dark I could only do it from deeper limbo.

Here's the story I told myself to cover it up: fine, maybe I wanted you to see my darkness. But it was only to frighten you into stopping!

But I've already admitted that I _wanted_ you to dig in, and that I knew this would cause it. Plus, I *know* there's a way of fighting evil that doesn't cause this.

Of *course* making you dig in was the real reason I wielded contempt. It didn't accomplish anything else. My feeling of dismay at the outcome was just a decoy to let me believe I wasn't responsible.

---

I *cannot* see you as "less than" without letting it leak somehow. Part of me knows this, and I still do it—which means I don't care if you see it.

It's not that I *want* you to hurt, per se, but I also don't care if you do—nor do I care if you see this about me. And on top of that, I dress it up as "righteous"—which means I'm not planning to stop. I will block any attempts from you to reach my conscience, and you can see that.

This pattern is so common that you recognize it instantly. Which means you don't start by asking me nicely to stop, or attempt to reach my conscience. You go straight for the jugular—and end up proving exactly what I needed you to prove: you're acting in bad faith and must be stopped at any cost.

---

I'm not just making you dig in; I'm screwing with your whole sense of reality and morality. I'm showing you that even the so-called "good people" are willing to harm you for a "good cause." This chips away at your faith in humanity; darkens your world—but I'm fine with that, because the ends justify the means.

I'm giving you license to embrace your own darkness.

Why on Earth would I do that?

---

Have you ever been so angry you didn't care what it destroyed—as long as it made them feel it?

While you were in that state, it felt like you. Like you were finally seeing clearly; cutting through all the noise, etc. But afterward, didn't it feel like "whoa, that wasn't me?" It felt almost like you were possessed.

There's an aspect of my mind that lures me away from my conscience with clever justifications. By falling for it, I "turn away from my (or the) Light." You can see it in my eyes. I've handed control over to this thing—that same "possession."

And while it's in control, look what it creates: a darker world, in which both me and my enemy both feel compelled to hand it *more* control. The "real me"—does it want that? Of course not.

So here we have something that doesn't feel like me, but lures me into giving it control—at which point it *does* feel like me, but works toward goals that benefit it, while harming me.

It does this by perpetrating an impossibly clever ruse: revealing itself to my enemy while hiding itself from me, causing them to see me as evil, which I then use against them.

And then afterward, it covers its tracks. I don't look back and think "shoot, I just darkened the world." I feel even more like the world's valiant savior, righteously battling the hordes of evil.

When I phrase it that way, doesn't it sound suspiciously like... a parasite?

---

The more we see this thing in action, the more we'll discover a sense in which it has its own agenda—one that's against not only mine, but all of humanity's.

For now, you can think of it as an aspect of yourself. There's an important sense in which it isn't "you" (which we'll explore more later), but you're certainly responsible for the harm you've caused while under its sway.

I'll sometimes call it "it" (or the parasite), and sometimes you. The meaning should be clear from context.

---
## In Too Deep

Let's look at how it covers itself up.

Part of me knew what I was doing, even as I was doing it. The harm it caused you was real and profound. Which means that I know how a perfectly decent human—me—can commit great evil while flawlessly convinced he's helping.

Which means that maybe I'm wrong about you. Maybe you're not fundamentally evil after all. Maybe you're just caught in a different version of the same trap. 

That would be devastating—because it would mean that I'm shoving an inherently redeemable person deeper into the abyss; into that dark place where evil feels *necessary.*

When you dug in, I knew you became worse, but I convinced myself I was merely exposing the darkness already latent in your mind, for all the world to see. Now I see I actually created *new* evil—which you will certainly spread to others.

And the worst part is, whether or not we call it "intentional," I did this all *consciously*.

That's *way* too dark to face. I must bury it so deep that even *I* will never know what I've done.

---

If I could recognize it as a parasite in that moment—something I'm responsible for yet which isn't "me"—I would still feel *remorse.* But I'd be able to make amends while also committing to never doing it again.

Instead, I feel profound guilt and shame—making me much less likely to recognize what actually happened. This makes me *more* susceptible to it in the future.

Shame is one of its most powerful protective mechanisms. It may feel virtuous—like I'm being honest about my flaws—but it makes me a worse person. It also has the same effect on my enemies.

---

The part of me unaware that I've caused this—the part I normally think of as just "me"—look at how it feels.

The world is a darker place. Filled with horrible people. So I'll be less likely to notice the self-serving aspects of my actions and agendas.

Let's be honest: nearly every political agenda has pieces



This is what I mean by "hand more control to my parasite": it has an easier time luring me away from my conscience, while making me less likely to recognize that this is what's happening.

And it's not just my thoughts it's manipulating.

Even before this encounter, I didn't just _think_ you were evil—I could _see_ it in your eyes, _feel_ it emanating from you. And now that perception has just been strengthened.

It's not arguing with me about whether you're evil. It's making me _perceive_ you as evil, at a level below conscious awareness.

It's gaining increasing control over the very cognitive apparatus needed to detect its subterfuge.

That doesn't seem good.

---





---

Contempt isn't just "what you're doing is bad." It's "what you *are* is bad. Defective."

You're not fully human. That gives me the right to use you as a prop in my moral theater.

---

Doesn't the person seem somehow turned away from themselves, or perhaps from the "Light"?

That's what you're feeling with my contempt—just with the added veneer of righteousness.

I already know there's a way to fight evil that doesn't cause this. So what does the contempt add? Nothing, except the right to do this to you without compunction.

But it gets worse.

---

Isn't there some part of you that already knows this is how it works—even if you've never seen it laid it out so clearly?

We all instinctively recognize it. Which means you not only know what I'm doing; you know that *I* know it. We both know I'm pulling a ruse—one I'll never own up to, even to myself.

Here you are, witnessing a self-proclaimed "good person" gaslighting you to prove how good they are. This screws with your sense of reality and morality; chips away at your faith in humanity. Part of me *knows* this will happen—and I do it anyway.

The harm didn't just come from the simple act of mockery—it came from the *profound malice* implicit in the whole ruse. Although that harm results from the *entirety* of the ruse, that malice was present at the *start* of it.

In other words, I harmed you by showing you how much I was willing to harm you. It was a self-fulfilling prophecy.

And that's not all.

---

Whatever compunction you may have felt about the dark aspects of your own ideologies—I've just given you permission to override those, too.

Again, I may never have put the pieces together in this way, but isn't it completely obvious once stated?

The part of my mind that lured me away from my conscience just strengthened itself in me—and it strengthened the *same* part in you.

That's interesting. Normally, my dark part and yours—insofar as I think of them that way—I expect them to be *fighting* each other. And yet when it's laid out so clearly, it's pretty obvious that it can't work that way, right?

And going forward, we will both be more likely to act in ways that strengthen the same part in others, won't we?

Is this really what I wanted? Sure, I got something out of it, but in exchange for what? A darker world? That sounds like a Faustian bargain.

The only reason I accepted it was that the vast majority of its implications were hidden from me. I mean, they were all right there for me to see if I had looked, but I was turned away.

---

This part of me: it's not my friend. Well, except when it's in control of me, at which point it's more than just my friend—it feels like *me.*

Have you ever been so angry you didn't care what it destroyed—as long as it made them feel it?

While you were in it, it felt like you. Like you were finally seeing clearly; cutting through all the noise, etc.

But afterward, didn't it feel like "whoa, that wasn't me?" It felt almost like you were possessed.

Every time we hand control over to this thing, it feels increasingly like us. We defend it with more vigor. And it gains increasingly clever ways of convincing us to give it control.

---

Consider: the fact that I behave this way this means I know exactly how it's possible for a fundamentally decent person—myself—to act with great malice. It doesn't require *inherent evil*.

And yet when I look at you, I don't just *think* you're bad, I can practically *see* it; *feel* it. Why?

Well, if I recognized you as having been overtaken by your dark part—a part that you don't ultimately want—I would be very careful not to shove you deeper into it, even if I had to fiercely put an end to your behavior, wouldn't I?

Which part of me doesn't want me to see you that way?

This part of me—it doesn't just lure me with justifications. It manipulates my very perception.

And after our encounter, I'll see you even *more* clearly this way, won't I?

This thing is colonizing my entire mind, bit by bit; gaining more control over my thoughts and perceptions—the only tools I have to detect the subterfuge in the first place.

That seems dangerous.

---


Can you feel how the person seems somehow turned away from themselves, or perhaps from the "Light"?


---


Have you ever been on the receiving end of a dehumanizing gaze? You can *see* the malice, can't you?

Well, my desire for you to dig in is a little malicious, isn't it? And yet I'm pretending it's righteous. That's the "off" feeling you're detecting, and it's what makes you dig in. Malice alone doesn't cause that.

But it's actually worse than that, because I *knew* it would make you dig in.



If I were too obvious about it—if you could see that I knew—you wouldn't fall for it, would you?

But if it's in limbo for me? I'm still conscious of it, so I can 



It's almost as if the part of me that wanted this outcome also wanted you to *see* that I wanted it. After all, that would actually make it happen, wouldn't it?

Now, I want to be clear about this: it's not that I *consciously* wanted you to see it, in the usual sense of that word. Except here's the thing: the medicine showed me exactly where this desire had been lurking in my conscious mind the whole time. The desire **was** conscious—just more deeply hidden than my mere *hope* that you'd dig in.

And it gets worse.

Anyone who's been on the receiving end of contempt knows that this unique combination—of appearing righteous on the surface yet secretly malicious underneath—is enough to make anyone dig in. So I also knew it on the delivering end. It wasn't just a desire—it was an *intent.*

This is what contempt **is**: the secret intention to make you worse while pretending it's not my fault.

---

But why on Earth would I want to make my enemies worse?




What happens when you do dig in?


Your digging in wasn't accidental, and it wasn't just an unfortunate side-effect of my good intentions: **it was secretly the whole point.** I was just telling myself pretty stories about how good it would be—and buying them so completely that they became "true" for me.

Which meant that when you did dig in, I could only see it as your fault. Because not only did you fight back against my righteous behavior—which only an evil person would do—you were implicitly accusing *me* of being evil. How *dare* you. This world is even worse than I thought—licensing me to ignore my conscience a little more. To fight for good, of course.

And in case you didn't see this coming: *part of me knew that, too. That the whole thing was a ruse designed to free me a little more from my conscience.*

Let that sit for a moment.

---
## Plausible Deniability

It's difficult to unfold all the layers of this trap. Just to give you a taste: for me to hold it against you, I couldn't know that I caused it. But at the same time, there's no way for me to cause it without part of me knowing that I am.

So there are two parallel (conscious) layers of mind operating simultaneously and semi-independently. The left hand doesn't know what the right is doing. One does the dirty work while the other is kept clean.

This is the origin of plausible deniability. It doesn't start in governments or organizations, but right here in the individual psychology of *good people.* The "dark operative" doing dirty work while the "official part" maintains innocence? That architecture doesn't get imposed top-down. It blossoms from the bottom up; the natural, inevitable result of millions of us doing exactly this.

And then what do we feel when we locate the people up top "responsible for it all?"

*Contempt.*

We'll come back to that later.

---

## Feeling Limbo

We left one important question unanswered: _how_ did that part of me reveal itself to you—especially given that it was hidden from myself?

Imagine (if you will) being on the receiving end of a dehumanizing gaze. Can you feel how the person is somehow turned away from themselves—or perhaps away from the "Light"?

As we'll see later, it's impossible for me to do this without hiding something from myself—basically, your humanity. So I **cannot** wish harm or act selfishly without entering limbo—and that's what you see. 

**My limbo state is generally visible to you**—if only subconsciously. Notice how peculiar this is: hiding it from myself **is** what reveals it to you.

---
## Hall of Mirrors

Now, malice alone may send a shudder down your spine, but it probably doesn't make you dig in. For that, an extra ingredient is necessary: the pretense of good. That pair is what contempt *is*.

This combination—malice with the pretense of good—is something we both instinctively recognize. And because we both know it, it gives rise to a peculiar back-and-forth:

At first, I'm hiding my malice while pretending it's good. But part of me knows you (correctly) recognize this combination as hypocrisy—and that sucks.

So now I must also hide that from myself. But you now (correctly) recognize it as a kind of ruse.

So I hide that, too. But now you recognize that I'm trying to cover it up...

Resulting in a kind of hall-of-mirrors effect. You feel it as a maddening sense of "we both know what I'm really doing, and that it cannot be proven from the outside—so I'll never be forced to admit it, even to myself." And **that** is what ultimately ensures you dig in.

Notice how bizarre this is: I made you lose a bit of faith in humanity by showing you that even the so-called "good people" (me) are willing to harm you for their own gain. But what was the actual harm? It was... showing you that good people are willing to harm you for their own gain. That's circular.

It is the whole recursive structure of **hiding** of my true intention that **reveals** it, turning it into a self-fulfilling prophecy—and it required a careful orchestration of our "conscious" and limbo parts. (Analytical readers will appreciate the full gory details in the Appendix: Hall of Mirrors.)

---
## Simplified

You can also choose to look at the whole thing more simply: my willingness to turn away from my Light is what licenses you to do the same. Embracing my darkness empowers you to embrace yours.

Put another way: when you see me—a "good person"—ignoring my own conscience, you realize this world is even shittier than you thought, licensing you to ignore yours.

These are all equivalent formulations. In each case, part of me wanted you to see it—but since I "don't know" that, I see *you* as the bad one, giving me permission to do it more. It results in a downward spiral we're all familiar with.

---
## Hijacking Goodness

Now I don't just accuse you of being a *bad person* for no reason at all. It's (usually) because I see *you* being out of integrity in some way. I see something dark in you, and I feel compelled to attack it. Morally obligated.

I'm not just accusing you of doing something wrong. It's as if I perceive that darkness as being *inherent to your very nature*. And, having finally caught hold of this essence of *what's wrong with the world*, I'm not going to let it get away. I must punish it.

But in that moment, I cannot separate *it* from *you.* The sense of your inherent badness is somehow baked into my very perception of you. I don't just *think* you're bad—I *see* it; *feel* it. 

Now, I suspect your friends and allies don't see you this way—which means that it's *my own mind* altering my perception of you.

If it didn't—if I recognized you as a confused human like me—I might be able to understand you better and find a healthier (and more effective) way to stop or correct you.

Now, ask yourself: which part of me has an incentive to prevent me from seeing you like that? From giving in to my darkness? Might it be related to the part that lures me away from my conscience with clever rationalizations?

Of course it's the same part. This part of me—it manipulates both my thoughts *and* perceptions to draw me away from my Light. That's what makes it so insidious.

And after this interaction, won't I see you as even more surely defective, and vice versa? It now has a **tighter grip** on my mind—and yet I'm left feeling even *more* righteous; more confident than before. That sounds like a slippery slope.

Notice how it accomplished all this through hijacking a genuinely good trait: my desire to fight evil. And now I've given it more power over me, which means it can lead me even further from my Light next time.

---
## Thinking Your Way to Good

Similarly, when contemptuously judging bad people, it doesn't just *feel* righteous: you could probably prove that it *is.* (In fact, if this is your first time encountering this whole thing, you might have to re-read the earlier sections to remind yourself that *part of you already knows that it's not.*)

The problem isn't just that first initial thought / perception that lured you away from your Light. Once you're separated from it, your *whole cognitive apparatus* is unknowingly hijacked in service of your dark side—which means that you can't simply think your way out of it, no matter how careful you think you're being.

Have you ever tried to talk someone out of being evil? How well did that work?

And it's not a binary thing: separation from our Light happens along a continuum. Which means you might be in some version of it right now.

In fact, here's a simple test: is it possible for you to feel even a trace malice, contempt, or self-righteousness toward anybody for any reason? If so, it would be very difficult to not let it leak out in their presence, wouldn't it? This means the darkness is still operating in you.

In fact, even if you were somehow free of those dark sentiments, there are still traces of it woven into your perception of reality itself. When you survey the destruction humans have wrought against nature, can you sense how it requires a kind of contempt? We'll unpack that later.

Remember: you already know how to stop bad behavior without contempt. You recalled doing so earlier. I'm not saying it's easy—especially the greater the evil we face—but the **only** reason we ever believe it may not be enough is to license ourselves to pull the above ruse.

---
## Responsibility

You might call this process "unconscious" or "subconscious," and there's something to that. Jung would say this material was repressed into the shadow, genuinely hidden from awareness. 

But when the medicine took me back to a time I'd done this, as much as I resisted seeing it—*and believe me, I resisted*—it was there in consciousness, clear as day. I had **always known it,** but hadn't let myself see it.

This isn't semantic hairsplitting. If it's unconscious, I can tell myself "I'll deal with that later"—it's buried somewhere I can't access right now. If it's limbo, it's conscious. And when I know something consciously and do it anyway, it is **intentional**—I'm just turning away from it. Which means I have a profound responsibility to stop doing that. Right now.

So there is a sense in which it wasn't the real me—and a sense in which it absolutely was. I'll unpack that paradox later, but for now: I'm responsible either way.

---
## Summary

There's something in us that needs our enemies to be fundamentally defective—so it manipulates us into treating them in ways that make both of us worse.

You already knew this. Maybe not explicitly, but it was there in limbo the whole time.

And that's true for everyone. We all have this part. We all know, on some level, what it's doing.

What allows it to keep operating is that it stays in the shadows, where we can pretend not to know.

It's about time we drag it into the Light.

---
## The Medicine

By exposing the deepest layers of my mind, the medicine taught me this: I couldn't run from my lies forever. The very idea that I could was the deepest lie of all.

But more importantly, it showed me _how much better_ it feels when I don't have to. And how, the closer I get to my Light, the more obvious it is that I never _wanted_ to—and neither do you.

That's what I rob from you when I treat you with contempt: I'm nudging you a little further from the part of you that doesn't _want_ to carry the burden of ignoring your Light.

But it showed me so much more.

What I'm about to share isn't easy to face. But if you've made it this far, there's a part of you that's ready to see it.

---
## Interlude

Have you ever treated someone unkindly—perhaps mocking, shaming, or contemptuously judging them—only to discover later that you'd been unfair? That there was something about their story that rendered their behavior more understandable—even if not excusable—and how, if you'd known it at the time, you couldn't have been cruel?

Your perception of them shifted, right? Nothing changed about their outward appearance, and yet you *saw* something you hadn't before. A part of them that just wanted to be free of the pain.

And when you see that, you *can't help* but want to serve it. Not because you're especially noble, or because you calculated it would be "good," but because... it's just... obvious.

The person who corrected you with integrity: they were serving your Light; the *real you*—and they did that by refusing to accept your internal narrative about who you were in that moment; the *false* you. It's like they were reminding you of something you'd temporarily forgotten about yourself—but how?

And they weren't just serving you; they were serving something larger. How did they know these two would go hand in hand—that helping you *would* help the Whole? After all, you may have had different religions, politics, etc. 

And which *part* of them was serving you? In exactly the same way you can't win against your own conscience, didn't it feel like you couldn't win against that part? More importantly: did you even want to?

If they had chosen to treat you with contempt instead: which part of you would that have served? And would that have served the world?

Can you feel how the closer you get to your Light, the easier it is to see in others? It doesn't make you want to fight evil *less*. If anything, it makes you *more* protective of others—but you feel less need to inject your own darkness into it.

Where does this process stop?
