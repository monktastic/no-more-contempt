# Chapter I: Contempt
## Conscience

Have you ever done something you knew was wrong at the time, but couldn't fully admit it to yourself until later? Maybe you made a cruel comment to boost your ego, took credit for someone else's work, or cheated on a test (or even partner).

While you were doing it, one part of you knew it was wrong, while another was busy producing justifications for why it wasn't "really" wrong.

Notice an asymmetry here: the part that *knew*—your conscience—wasn't trying to justify itself. It just... was. The part providing justifications wasn't trying to convince *it*; it was trying to convince you—that your conscience was just one more voice among the noise.

But it wasn't.

---
## Limbo

At some point, you realized you were fooling yourself—and yet this wasn't new information. Somehow you had *always* known, but had convinced yourself you didn't.

Knowledge of your wrongdoing existed in a kind of "limbo state": a bizarre schism of mind in which we simultaneously know something and yet are sure we don't. It's a profound form of self-deception, but we don't do it because we're "bad people." We do it as a form of self-protection.

The crucial part is that this knowledge was **not unconscious**. It was always consciously accessible, even as you were doing it. You had just kept your attention turned away.

Consider the implications: the intentions we *think* we have are sometimes not our "true" intentions. How often is this happening? What would a world look like in which humans were doing this nearly all the time?

How would we ever know? How could we ever stop?

---
## Contempt and Integrity

Think back to a moment you felt contemptuously judged by another person. No matter how "right" they may have been; even if you *knew* you had done wrong, something felt *off* about them, didn't it? You could tell they weren't coming from a good place. How?

Now think of a time when someone set you straight with profound integrity—seemingly getting nothing out of it themselves. Even if it stung your ego; made you lose face, you had no desire to take revenge, did you? Why not? What could you tell they were serving?

Now turn it around.

Think of a time when *you* contemptuously judged someone. Even if you tried to hide your contempt, they still dug in their heels, didn't they? And somewhere inside, that resistance confirmed what you already believed.

And finally, a time when you corrected someone with integrity yourself. Perhaps you had to do it with more ferocity; more violence than in the previous case—and yet something in you knew it would ultimately bring more peace. *How* did you know?

---

That time you stood in integrity, and the time the person who corrected you did: even if you knew nothing else about them—their politics, their religion, their creed—didn't it feel like you were somehow serving the same thing? What is that?

And the time you stood in contempt, and were treated with contempt: didn't it feel like *those* were somehow serving the same thing? Not just your individual egos, either.

Integrity feels clean from both the inside and outside.

Contempt feels righteous inside but dark, dirty, insincere from the outside.

There's a reason for that distinction—and seeing it clearly changed everything for me.

---
## How Contempt Works

When I correct you with integrity, I see your actions as bad, but I see you as redeemable. With contempt, I see *you* as bad—*fundamentally* defective; irredeemable. It's an attack on your very being.

Stripped of all justifications, how does that *feel* to deliver?

Try this. Find an innocent person, and try to convey—with body language, tone, gaze, etc.—that they are *inherently defective.* You can even couch it in sweet language if you like. But it still feels dirty, doesn't it? Both to you and to them.

Could that feeling ever make a person better? Or could it only make them feel:

>***Fuck** you. Being cruel while pretending it's righteous—and you think you're going to get away with this? Yeah, I'll show you who's dark.*

Isn't it obvious when you stop to think about it? Yet when I'm doing this to you, I *don't* stop and think about it, do I? 

Why not?

---

I'm in a kind of tunnel vision, driving toward a predetermined conclusion. If I did stop and reflect on it, could I still do it? It would be a lot harder, wouldn't it?

Even if I see you as an evil monster who must be stopped at any cost, the mere act of making myself fully aware of the darkness I'm projecting would soften its blow. I might have a brief glimmer of "*oh shit, what am I actually doing here?*", which would weaken it.

Pause and check if that's true for you.

I'd like to tell myself that this knowledge is unconscious, but is it really? Or is it the kind of thing I'd have to hide from myself—only to discover much later that I knew exactly what I was doing?

But what *am* I doing?

---

Let's take stock of the evidence.

There's a part of me that wants **nothing** more than to violently punish evil, and I've just nudged you one step closer to being the kind of person who can only be dealt with in that way—despite knowing there was a way that wouldn't cause this.

Does this seem like a coincidence to you? Or would I just tell myself it's a coincidence, because of how dark it is?

And am I going to treat you with *less* contempt next time? And the time after?

---

Suppose, for a moment, that there really were an aspect of my mind trying to drive me toward Armageddon—a situation in which I'm "forced" to unleash the full extent of my righteous wrath. How might it accomplish this?

Well first, it wouldn't come out and announce itself to me, or else I'd immediately put an end to it. It would have to hide itself very cleverly—so cleverly that even if someone pointed at it very directly, I would resist seeing it. "That couldn't possibly live in *me*..."

It would encourage me to see certain people as "bad"—as if their misbehavior was of a fundamentally different nature than mine. This way I couldn't *help* but treat them with contempt.

Then, when some part of me tried to warn me that this was a terrible idea, it would drown out that warning with rationalizations of how *righteous* it was; how naive my conscience is.

In other words, it would have to turn me away from my better nature, by making it feel *delicious.*

It would make sure my enemy saw this in my eyes, even as I was unable to feel it myself. It would make them think:

>*You fucking hypocrite! I can literally **see** the darkness in you, even as you pretend it's noble! And you're going to sit here and moralize me?*

It would make them feel like they were looking at everything wrong with the world—making them feel morally *compelled* to stop me.

And this would seal the trap shut. It would prove to me that they are, indeed, fundamentally defective—forcing me to escalate.

Then, we would both walk away feeling the need to give this part of ourselves *more* power in the future—while being *less* likely to notice that this is what we're actually doing.

It would increasingly just feel like... us.

---

## The Mechanism

Notice how the hiding-it-from-myself and the revealing-it-to-you aren't actually two separate things: my hiding is itself what's visible to you. It's what makes it so maddening. It's like we both know what I'm doing—but also that you can't name it.

In other words, the hiding **is** the revealing.

And I *need* to hide it from myself, both to be able to do it and to blame it on you.

Take stock of the mechanism.

There's an aspect of my mind that turns me away from my better nature, simultaneously revealing this to you while hiding it from me, which turns you away from yours, while letting me judge you for it, so that I'll be forced to escalate?

That's awfully precise, isn't it? It would be difficult to design a mechanism better suited to spreading darkness.

---

## Ego?

After this interaction, you're convinced that I'm irredeemably bad. You now live in a darker world.

In that world, are you likely to be more kind to others, or less? More likely to notice the self-serving aspects of your own actions and agendas, or to overlook them as necessary? What about all the people you pass this toxicity on to?

Maybe you recognize this mechanism as "ego." But I normally think of my ego as something meant to protect me, right? In that case, why is it creating a world in which not only are my enemies more dug in, but which is generically darker?

And my ego is supposed to *fight* yours, isn't it? Yet the world we're creating serves neither of us.

And this happens reliably.

---

## Fighting Evil

Make no mistake: evil must be fought—fiercely; even violently when necessary. But contempt isn't actually meant to fight evil. It's meant to create it while letting me *believe* I'm fighting it.

I need **so badly** to know that darkness exists only outside myself that part of me must find clever ways to create it—so that I can point at it and say "see?"

But I cannot perpetrate this ruse on "good people" because of my self-image. So this part of me searches for opportunities where it *can* unleash itself—situations that give me plausible deniability. 

Contempt for beliefs and behaviors can actually be helpful—so who can blame me if it "accidentally" spills over into contempt for the people themselves? What's the difference, anyway?

---

For this to achieve my goal, I must have *no idea* I'm doing it—and yet it cannot be completely unconscious either. If it were, I would be surprised or confused when my enemies accused me of it. Instead, I adapt my strategy in real-time to ensure I achieve my result.

> *I'm not trying to make them feel bad! Okay I am, but it's just to help them see how bad they are, so that they change! And if they don't change, that just proves me right! 
> 
> Okay, maybe I'm flashing them my own darkness—but it's only to show them what I'm really capable of! To frighten them into stopping.
> 
> Okay fine, maybe I'm provoking their darkness—but I'm only revealing what's already there, not creating more!
> 
> My darkness isn't real darkness; it's just strategic—the kind all "good people" must harbor to fight evil!*

That's not something an unconscious mind does. The knowledge is conscious-but-hidden. 

The "limbo state" isn't a bug—it's a feature.

And this is *far* from the only situation in which it operates.

---

## The Contagion

Any time any one of us skirts our conscience—say, by shaving off a little extra somewhere—we're subtly lowering the threshold for others to do the same. Think about it: in a society where such behavior is normalized, isn't everyone more likely to ignore their conscience *in general*? To say "fuck it, why should I be the lone chump following my 'better nature'?"

[not just about the actions, but the way people carry themselves.]

We may not think of cutting corners as "darkness," but it depends on the same mechanism— turning away from my better nature—and feeds the same part in others.

We also don't think of it as *contempt*, but can you sense how it carries the same flavor? I can only benefit myself at the world's expense by treating others as subtly "less than"; by elevating myself above them.

And this can be an incredibly subtle move. I've never literally thought of my partner as "inherently defective," but who hasn't felt that flash of "what's *wrong* with you" during a fight?

There's a reason contempt is the #1 predictor of divorce, and why divorces so often have that bitter feeling of scorched earth; total war. Each side feels like the exclusive victim/hero, and has zero compunction sticking it to the evil other. *Armageddon*.

Every one of these seemingly-unrelated behaviors—contempt for my enemies; skirting my conscience; contempt for my partner—makes the world a bit darker, and makes me more cynical. And under those conditions, each of us is *more* likely to do all those things—not less.

---

## The Scale

Helpless animals being brutalized in factory farms; prison inmates subjected to inhumane conditions; corporations plundering nature for profit—can you feel how each of these requires the same fundamental "turning away"? People must overlook the life; the sacredness in others to do them. And each becomes more frictionless in a darker, more cynical world.

Greedy bankers; corrupt politicians; hypocritical CEOs—doesn't their dirty work get easier in a world mired in darkness?

Nazis called their victims "vermin," and the Tutsis, "cockroaches." Every genocide depends on contempt to twist regular people into monsters.

The aspect of mind that makes it feel righteous to dehumanize you—can you feel how it's the same mechanism as all the above, even if not on the same scale?

When I treat my enemy with contempt, I'm not just making them dig in against *me*—I'm subtly darkening my ambient environment, making each of these things ever-so-slightly more likely.

And then, when that darker world results in more atrocities—against people, animals, nature—what do I feel for the perpetrators?

It's as if there's a life-denying, life-destroying force pushing us to the brink. Is that what I want?

---

## The Parasite

This part of me that hides itself from me to darken the world—why does it have to "turn me away from myself" to do its dirty deed?

Consider: have you ever been so angry you didn't care what it destroyed—as long as it made them feel it?

While you were in that state, it felt like you were finally seeing clearly; cutting through all the noise, etc., right? But afterward, didn't it feel like "whoa, that wasn't me?" It's almost like you were *possessed*.

So here we have something that hides from me and doesn't feel like me, and occasionally lures me away from my better nature. When I'm turned away, it takes control—at which point it *does* feel like me, but works toward a world that's more hospitable to it, and less hospitable to us.

**It is a parasite, and I am its host.**

This does **not** absolve me of responsibility for all the harm I've caused while under its sway—but it does point at a way out.

Because as I become more free of it—which I can actually do—not only do I cause less harm, but I become increasingly aware that _you_ can only cause harm for exactly the same reason. You're not _inherently_ defective; you're just lost in a different version of the same trap.

Which means that instead of treating you with contempt, I become increasingly aware of the conditions that enable you to fall under its sway, and more able to work with them.

Don't get me wrong—I still *stop* you, using as much force as necessary. But I no longer make the tragic mistake of gleefully driving the parasite deeper into your mind; feeding our nemesis.

And you *feel* this difference, don't you? It's like I'm reminding you of something you've temporarily forgotten in yourself. That *this darkness isn't you*.

The part of me that lies beneath my parasite—my "better nature"—it begins to link up with yours. They remember where the true fight lies—exactly what the darkness doesn't want us to see.

That doesn't mean we agree on everything, or even like each other. We might still have different ideas on how to help the world, but the bitterness evaporates. We're both working against the darkness—and we recognize this in each other.

---

It's not just a matter of thinking differently or donning rose-colored glasses.

If I pretend to see the good in Hitler, I'm liable to cause a lot more harm than if I'd just shot him. (Though depending on the *way* I shoot him, I can still elicit either bloodlust or integrity in others.)

Learning to actually see and reach the aspect under the darkness in others—their Light—is a skill. And skills take time to develop.

And it's not an independent skill from learning to evict the darkness from my own mind: finding all the pain, confusion, insecurity, etc.—all the "hooks" it uses to draw me away from my better nature—and healing them. This *automatically* makes it easier for me to see the Light in others.

To whatever degree I haven't done this work, there will *always* be areas in my life where I'm pumping darkness into the world while flawlessly convinced I'm helping.

And nearly every one of us is doing this without having any idea that we are. *That* is why the world is in the state it's in.

---

Try and recall how *certain* you feel when wielding contempt against your enemies. You can't just reason yourself out of that state, can you?

The darkness doesn't just draw you away with a single thought and then stop. It continually manipulates your thoughts, so that they act in *service* of your darkness.

And you don't just *think* your enemy is evil: you practically *see* it; *feel* it. It's the same reason that dehumanizing can feel righteous.

So it doesn't just manipulate your thoughts, but your feelings and perceptions. It hijacks your *entire cognitive apparatus*—all the tools you'd need to detect that you're lost.

And after that interaction with your enemy, don't you see them as *more* surely defective? And not just them, but people *like* them, who you're then also forced to contemn?

It's not just manipulating your perceptions while you're in the state of contempt. Your baseline state has shifted—but you have no way of detecting this. It just feels... normal. Righteous.

This is why you cannot simply talk a person out of being evil. Their entire perceived reality is internally consistent in a way that powerfully resists all attempts to puncture it.

How would you know whether you're lost in some (lesser) version of that right now? A state in which you cannot trust your own thoughts to guide you toward what is good?

Would you be surprised to learn that narly *all* of us are? That it's a matter of degree, and not kind?

---

## Collaboration

Your parasite and mine—they're not independent.

I don't just attack you randomly. The darker my own state, the more I go *hunting* for darkness in others—almost like mine is sensing its way toward yours. And when it finds you? It *reveals* itself to you, knowing this will help yours ingratiate itself to you further—almost like a kind of secret handshake between the two; an agreement to keep this world bound in darkness.

You can actually learn to feel this as you become more sensitive. And it's not subtle.

When I gather with my "allies" to foster contempt for our enemies behind closed doors—something about the energy of the room feels a bit "off," doesn't it? My darkness recognizes it as a safe space to come out and play with the others.

And ours somehow work together to keep the Light out. Have you felt that? Maybe you sense that "your team" is using the same dirty tricks you ruthlessly judge your enemies for—but do you dare speak up in the presence of that energy? You know you'll be excommunicated if you name what's happening, don't you?

But by whom—or *what*? Any one of these people, in different circumstances, might be safe to confide in. But as a group? There's a dark synergy there that's difficult to grapple with.

It's almost like our parasites are *conspiring*—yet there's no explicit coordination. In fact, any attempt to make it explicit would destroy the veil of plausible deniability that it requires. It's somehow operating in our shared blind spot; harnessing our shared intelligence.

And then, when we all walk away, and that temporary pattern dissolves, none of us will be consciously aware of the darkness we've infused into the world.

What would our world look like if this kind of "conspiracy" were happening all over the place, in countless seemingly-unrelated contexts, at every scale up to the civilizational? Water-cooler conversations, locker room talk, boardroom meetings, political rallies, military war rooms, ...

---

It's almost like there's a singular distributed malevolent entity, relentlessly driving humanity toward catastrophe—one that we can never quite pin down, because it's so amorphous and yet seemingly-intelligent.

It has "control centers" in each of our minds that it periodically calls upon—yet each of us feels certain that we're uniquely immune to it; free of it. It's only *other people* that are the problem. We never recognize that this feeling of being the valiant one fighting the conspiracy **is** the conspiracy.

So what do we do? We spend all our time finding clever ways to defeat others—so that our pure agendas and ideologies come out on top. Not because they benefit us in countless ways we can't yet admit, of course, but because they're uniquely noble—the only way to save the world.

---

Here's the core problem: the more unmoored I become from my Light, the less I'm able to notice that I am. The more I begin to accept substitutes as the real thing.

Correcting with integrity feels "righteous," and violently punishing evil feels "righteous"—but they don't feel the same at all, do they?

How can one word have two nearly-opposite meanings? Why didn't anyone at the dictionary stop and say "you know what guys, maybe this isn't such a great idea?"

It wouldn't have mattered, would it? Any way I try to define or pin down "goodness," the darkness will usurp it for its own purposes.

Reasoning can be used in service of the Light—obviously. But the more my cognition is hijacked by my darkness—a condition I can't identify by thinking harder about it—the more I tell myself *stories* of how good my agendas, ideologies, projects, etc. are; and the more I believe it.

This is the condition that nearly all of humanity is lost in—and we will not think our way out of it.

There was only *one thing* that could warn me that my contempt would darken the world, and my thinking mind wrote it off as naive or "mere intuition" because it had no way to justify itself.

What would happen if all of humanity wrote off this part of ourselves as mysticism or "woo," fetishizing rationality and intellect above all else? If that became our dominant worldview?

What would the world look like then?

And which part of us would benefit from that?

---

The biosphere isn't collapsing because we're not thinking hard enough. It's collapsing because we've convinced ourselves that thinking harder is enough to save it.

## Interlude

How deep does the limbo state go? How much of what I've described is stuff that you could have noticed by yourself if you'd just looked harder?

I'll share what I found for myself.

All of this is consciously accessible in the moment of contempt—but at progressively deeper layers of hiding.

I know, even while contemning you, that you're only able to cause harm for the same reason I am—that it's not the "real you."

Which means that I'm harming a fundamentally innocent person. Someone who's just lost in countless layers of pain and confusion.

And at that layer of knowledge, my behavior feels *malevolent*—like the distilled essence of *all the evil there ever was.*

Which is why I have to hide it from myself so. Fucking. Hard.

And part of you senses that I'm doing this—which is why you rebel so hard yourself.

And I *know* that's why you're rebelling. Which is why I have to smother your cries in such a way that nobody will recognize them for what they really are.

**That's** the darkness you're seeing in my eyes. It's a recursive hiding—like a hall of mirrors.

I'm genuinely sorry to have to do this to you.

But I don't know how to stop.
