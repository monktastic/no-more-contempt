# Chapter I: Contempt
## Conscience

Have you ever done something you knew was wrong at the time, but couldn't fully admit it to yourself until later? Maybe you made a cruel comment to boost your ego, took credit for someone else's work, or cheated on a test (or even partner).

While you were doing it, one part of you knew it was wrong, while another was busy producing justifications for why it wasn't "really" wrong. Notice the asymmetry: the part that knew—your conscience—wasn't trying to justify itself. It just... was.

The justifications weren't there to convince *it* (which never really works), but to convince *you*—that your conscience was just another voice in the sea of noise, equal to all the rest. That way, you could look back later and pretend you had no way of knowing.

Didn't you know you were deceiving yourself even in the moment? Yet you forged ahead anyway...

---
## Limbo

At some point, knowledge of your self-deception broke through into conscious awareness.

Where had it been hiding until then?

Was it *unconscious?* No. Looking back, can you see that it had always been available to your conscious mind? You just weren't... looking at it.

Consider how strange this is—that there can be knowledge hidden in your *conscious mind* that you somehow aren't seeing. Not because you *can't*, but because you *won't*.

Such knowledge exists in a kind of *limbo state*—a bizarre, paradoxical schism of mind in which we simultaneously *know* and yet somehow *don't*... until one day we realize we always did. 

And it's not just passively sitting there either. It's actively shaping your words, your gestures, your decisions—and on some level, you know this is happening. There are two parallel tracks running in your mind: the story you're telling yourself, and the truth you're hiding from. One is acknowledged, the other denied.

This state lies on a continuum. There are little white lies we tell ourselves, and then much bigger ones—and the bigger they are, the more strongly we resist seeing them. Not because they're any less available to consciousness, but because we're shielding it harder.

What would the world look like if all of humanity were lost in some version of limbo nearly all the time—if we weren't being completely honest with ourselves about our true intentions? How would this manifest in our systems, our culture, our civilization?

What would happen if we stopped?

---
## Contempt and Integrity

Think back to a moment you felt contemptuously judged by another person. No matter how "right" they may have been; even if you *knew* you had done wrong, something felt *off* about them, didn't it? You could tell they weren't coming from a good place. How?

Now think of a time when someone set you straight with profound integrity—seemingly getting nothing out of it themselves. Even if it stung your ego; made you lose face, you had no desire to take revenge, did you? Why not? What felt different about them?

Now turn it around.

Think of a time when you judged someone, whether out loud or not. Something in you wanted them to feel a bit of a sting, right? Even if you tried to hide that intention, they still dug in their heels, didn't they? Why do you think that is?

And finally, a time when you corrected someone with integrity yourself. Perhaps you had to do it with more ferocity; more violence than in the previous case—and yet something in you knew it would ultimately bring more peace. *How* did you know?

---

That time you stood in integrity, and the time the person who corrected you did: even if you knew nothing else about them—their politics, their religion, their creed—didn't it feel like you were somehow serving the same thing, beyond personal interests? What is that?

And the time you stood in contempt, and were treated with contempt: didn't it feel like *those* were somehow serving the same thing? Not just your individual egos, either.

Integrity feels clean from both the inside and outside.

Contempt feels righteous inside but dark, dirty, insincere from the outside.

There's a reason for that distinction—and seeing it clearly changed everything for me.

---
## How Contempt Works

When you contemptuously judge someone, you want them to feel the sting—of being wrong, stupid, bad, etc. Stripped of all justifications, how does that *feel* to deliver?

Try this. Find an innocent person, and try to deliver that same experience to them—through body language, tone, gaze, etc. Even if you couch it in sweet language, it still feels dirty, doesn't it? Why?

Because it's *malicious.*

Now imagine delivering it to a "bad person." It suddenly feels *righteous*, doesn't it?

What changed? Did the malice magically disappear? They still feel it, don't they?

It hasn't gone away—you've just re-branded it as *goodness,* so that it wouldn't feel dirty to you.

You're displaying a combination of malice and moral superiority. Could that ever make a person better? Or could it only make them feel:

>***Fuck** you! Trying to disguise your malice as righteous? You may have fooled yourself, but you're not fooling me. You want darkness, I'll give you darkness.*

And how does that reaction make you see them? What kind of person would respond to your noble intentions in such a vile manner?

They've left you no choice—the kid gloves must come off.

---

Both sides are now more dug in. Couldn't you have seen this coming? Why didn't you?

Is it just because you were caught up in the moment? Or does it benefit you in some way?

Your target has just proven themselves to be the despicable person you feared they were. Don't you feel at least a *twinge* of vindication, or relief, or satisfaction? It helps you confirm your worldview, in which you're valiantly fighting the hordes of evil and stupidity—right?

Turn it around: on the receiving end, doesn't it feel like the person cares more about proving you're bad than about the truth? That they're throwing you under the bus for their own benefit?

And how does that make you feel—not just about them, but the world? It feels like a darker place, doesn't it? One that's more clearly "every man for himself"? In that world, are you more likely to obey your conscience, or to write it off as naive?

They've just darkened your mind. Caused genuine harm. They're doing it for their own benefit—and part of them knows it.

---

The truth is, when I contemn you, part of me knows I'm doing this—that I'm flashing you my darkness, knowing it will provoke yours, so that I can be right about you.

Of *course* I'd have to hide this from myself—both to be willing to do it, and to blame the result on you. And there's a third, more subtle reason, too: this unique combination of knowing-yet-hiding makes it especially maddening. If I displayed open malice without hiding behind righteousness, I would just look cartoonishly evil.

What I'm doing is showing you that genuine goodness is a myth; that even the so-called "good people" are ultimately frauds, willing to embrace the darkness when they know they can get away with it. And that is uniquely damaging to your psyche.

For all these reasons, I cannot be fully aware of it. 

On the other hand, it can't be unconscious, either—or else when you accused me of it, I would be confused or embarrassed. Instead, I adapt my responses in real-time, to ensure that I achieve my goal. That's not something the unconscious can do. Moreover, it wouldn't feel to you like I'm hiding something.

So it must be conscious, and it must be hidden. Limbo.

But it gets worse.

---

By doing this, I begin to see how a fundamentally decent person—me—can cause great harm by simply turning away from what they know is right. It doesn't require *inherent evil.* And that makes me wonder: might this not explain *your* misbehavior?

*Fuck.* Of course it does.

So I might be darkening the mind of a fundamentally innocent being—someone who's only lost in a deeper version of the very trap I'm caught in *right now*. I'm shoving them deeper into the abyss that enables wrongdoing in the first place; extinguishing hope from their mind.

That's impossibly dark. Which means that... I must bury the truth *harder.*

Because if I'm honest, this is not the first time I've suspected this. Part of me has always kind of known it—that all the cruelty, all the self-righteousness I've been spewing... has been darkening the world... feeding exactly the problems I claim to oppose.

The greedy bankers, hypocritical CEOs, lying politicians, all the people I hate... it would mean they're not doing a *different* thing than me. They're just caught in a deeper version of the *same* thing—and I'm making them more likely to do it, just to prove how different I am.

And that just cannot be.

So that must **not** be what I'm doing. My contempt is **righteous**, and I must do it *harder*.

---

What would it look like if the whole world were lost in some version of this trap?

If we were all avoiding something dark in ourselves, causing us to project it onto others, where we're "forced" to attack it—thereby keeping us trapped in an endless cycle of contempt and retribution?

It would look like all the animosity, political division, etc. we see—but it would explain a lot more, too.

---

Notice how you don't just *think* your enemies are bad; you can practically *see* it; *feel* it. So you can't simply reason your way out of this state—and after every such interaction, it gets harder.

And it doesn't just make you treat those people with contempt directly. It makes you more likely to foster contempt amongst your allies, who are all but guaranteed to spread that toxicity.

You're more likely to overlook the self-serving aspects of *all* your behaviors and agendas. They don't seem so bad in comparison to what *those people* do. In fact, they're not self-serving at all—they're simply necessary, and "just happen" to benefit you as a happy coincidence.

And anyway, isn't this what everyone else is doing—even the so-called "normal" people? Why should you be the lone chump?

And slowly, this becomes the norm.

In that kind of shitty world, don't the rainforests start to matter less? Inhabitants who once found them sacred—faced with the encroaching meaninglessness and selfishness of the world, might they have to sacrifice those lofty values for more practical concerns, like feeding their families?

The CEOs of the conglomerates hiring those people—don't they feel more justified?

The shareholders of those companies; the pension funds that invest in them—aren't they more likely to turn a blind eye, because regular people are hurting, too?

My desperate need to avoid confronting the darkness within—it doesn't just darken the world in some abstract sense. It has actual, physical consequences.

---

The solution is not "try to be a better person"—in fact, that's part of the problem.

Because if there are better people, then there are worse people—and what am I going to feel toward them?

The actual solution is far more radical.

See, at the very deepest level, I don't want to be doing any of this. I actually want a more beautiful world. That's authentic.

But this authentic desire has been hijacked. Some part of my mind is using it as an excuse to create more darkness.

And as I gain more insight into how it's manipulating me, the more clearly I see it happening in you. The more I become able to free you of yours, instead of reinforcing it.

And don't worry, this isn't some kum-ba-ya thing—it still requires fierce, determined action. Holding people accountable. If anything, it requires *more,* as I recognize my true responsibility.

And I begin to see more—how this pattern doesn't just manipulate us individually, but somehow synergistically. How there are complex interactions between ours, giving the overall system an eerie sense of being alive; even intelligent.

By learning to see what I am beneath all my darkness, I increasingly discover my role in bringing down this dark system that almost seems to be enslaving humanity.

---







My desire to fight evil—that's authentic. I actually want to see this world flourish. In fact, that's my *deepest* purpose.

But I also know that I'm not always in alignment with this deepest desire—to put it mildly.

And I'm afraid of the world finding that out. What would people say if they knew I'd been knowingly harming people—*fundamentally innocent* people!—for my own benefit? What would my enemies say?

But even worse, what does it mean about me? Might I be... *dark*?

My willingness to harm you, even knowingly—it's not actually malice. It's the result of a profound terror that I'm unable to confront

Evil is what that mistake looks like from the *outside.*

---







We've already established that there's a part of you that finds *nothing* more viscerally satisfying than violently punishing evil, and you've just nudged your enemy one step closer to being the kind of person who can only be dealt with like that—despite knowing there was a better way.

Does that seem like a coincidence to you?

But why do you want that?




There are uncomfortable aspects of each of us that we're not ready to admit to ourselves—let alone let the world see. A world full of corrupt and despicable people—as much as we hate it, does such a world make it easier or harder to keep those aspects of ourselves hidden?

So there's clearly an aspect of us that benefits from this outcome—the same aspect that we try to keep hidden. And isn't it also the part that *caused* it?

Think about it. We've already established that there's a dark part of you that finds *nothing* more primally satisfying than violently punishing evil, and you've just nudged your enemy one step closer to being the kind of person who can only be dealt with that way—despite knowing there was a way that wouldn't cause this.

Does that seem like a coincidence?

Let's ask it another way. If that part of you somehow wanted to achieve its goal—a darker world in which to hide itself—what better way than this? Than attacking a "bad person" in a way that appears unmistakably righteous, so that you'd never realize what you'd done?

---









You gave them a chance, and look what they did. This world is even shittier than you thought.

In a darker world, aren't you more likely to overlook the self-serving aspects of your own actions and agendas? Don't they feel more justified, given all the nonsense you have to put up with? After all, they're nothing compared to what these other idiots are doing.

Think back to that part of you that lures you away from your conscience with rationalizations. Might that not be the same part of you that produced this outcome, by making your malice feel righteous? And it has just gotten stronger—better at convincing you.

Let's spell it out.

The part of you that wants to be selfish, but needs excuses to do so—it has just manufactured an ideal situation in which to give you those excuses, by blinding you to the fact that you caused it.

And it did this by harming another human being.

Think about what this looks like from their perspective. Here you are, a self-proclaimed good person, willing to throw them under the bus for your own benefit—while pretending it's righteous.

What does that do to a mind?

---




What does that do to a person? Doesn't it make their world slightly darker—chip away at their faith in humanity? And does that make them feel _more_ justified in whatever story is driving their misbehavior, or less? More likely to obey their conscience in the future, or to ignore it?

Couldn't you have predicted this, if you'd stopped and thought about it? 

Why *didn't* you?

---



Might you be getting something out of it—from your enemy digging in, proving them to be the monster you always knew they were?

---

As much as I don't actually want dug-in enemies, something about them proving themselves irredeemable is *vindicating* or *satisfying* or *relieving* in a way that's hard to admit, isn't it?

But why?

Because it lets me avoid questioning my worldview. See, if they're redeemable, then I've just made them worse people—more cynical, more defensive, more likely to cause harm. And I could have easily seen that, but chose instead to focus on my ideas of all the good it would do.

Which means that a person doesn't have to be "evil" to *knowingly* cause genuine harm—they just have to be willing to look away from the harm they're causing, in favor of their *ideas* of right and wrong. Which means that...

*Shit.*

Maybe other people are also just lost, desperately trying to hold together their worldviews. Confident they're doing good, because it's too painful to confront what they're actually doing. And I've just made it *harder* for them. Which would mean that the people they go on to harm—directly or indirectly—some of their blood is now on my hands.

And that just can't be.

So the fact that they're resisting me so viciously—it's definitely not because I'm projecting hypocrisy to reinforce their darkness and uphold my worldview. No, I'm just exposing the darkness already latent in their minds, for all the world to see—a veritable benefit to humanity!

That is the only story I will allow into my mind from now on.

---

If you're recognizing anything in these words, it's not because I'm teaching you something new—it's because part of you has always known it. Can you see that?

And it's terrifying to admit that we've always known this, because what would it mean about us that we continued to do it anyway?

So we must never let it fully into conscious awareness.

And it is **this**—this refusal to fully confront what we know—that is contagious.

When I treat you with contempt, you can see that I'm doing this. That's the "off" feeling you're sensing—and it powerfully licenses you to do the same; to turn away from what *you* know.

And at a deeper layer, I know it does this to you, but I'm turned away from that. And you can sense this, too.

It results in a kind of hall-of-mirrors effect, where we both know, at some level, what's really happening—but also that you can't name it without sounding crazy.

That's what makes contempt so uniquely maddening.

If I were being purely malicious, you could easily point at my malice and garner sympathy or understanding from others. You could easily prove that I'm the bad guy, and my trap would backfire.

But I cut off that escape route. I'm only trying to help—and if you fight back against that, well, it only proves me right about you.

Contempt is *weaponized hypocrisy*.

---

How did I know that part of you already knew it?

It's something we all instinctively understand, to one degree or another.

As conscious beings, we don't want to hurt. And to the degree we sense consciousness in others, we know *they* don't want to, either. It's like we can partly see ourselves in them.

Hurting them hurts *us*—so the only way we can do it is by partly shielding ourselves from feeling our commonality; from "othering" them.

And by symmetry, we sense that they probably have to do something similar.

If you've ever been on the receiving end of a dehumanizing gaze, you know what this feels like. There’s something distant in their gaze—like they’re looking at you without actually seeing you. Have you ever felt that?

It's the same thing I have to do to you to treat you with contempt. I have to forget our commonality—and that's an active process, because without any distractions, I naturally feel it. Think about it: in moments where your mind is calmest; in deepest peace—do you feel *more* connected to others, or less?

The contagion—it's a contagion of *othering.* When I do it to you—no matter how "evil" you may be—I strengthen that same tendency in you.

And I'm not just making you more likely to do it in occasional moments: when your world feels darker, your baseline level of "othering" gets stronger. You're more likely to skirt your conscience in general, because you're less able to feel how it affects others.

And because this convinces me that you're defective, *my* world looks darker, too. Which means I'm less likely to notice the self-serving aspects of my own actions and agendas, and more likely to feel that they're justified or even necessary.

---

Again, none of this is actually new information—it's something we can see if we take the time to look.

Our perception of the world as dark—of there being *inherently defective* people whom we must valiantly defeat—ensures that we will behave with contempt, and by doing so, darken the world further. We will then use that as justification to do it *more*, while being less likely to realize it's a justification.

What would it look like if the whole world were somehow caught in this spiral?

How could we break free?

---






It also retroactively justifies your contempt. If they expressed hurt or sadness, and you saw them as fully human, you might feel bad for wanting to hurt them, right? But if they reveal their own darkness, then you know you did the right thing—so you have a powerful incentive to draw it out.

I don't just want you to feel the sting; I need to know you're the kind of person who deserves it.

But it's even more fiendishly clever than that.

Why do I want it to look like I'm only trying to help? Sure, it lets me avoid guilt—but what does it do to *you*? If I were being purely malicious, you could easily point at my malice and garner sympathy or understanding from others, right? You could easily prove that I'm the bad guy, and my trap would backfire.

But by expressing malice and righteousness simultaneously, I look like a hypocrite, don't I? And that's maddening as hell—because you can sense that part of me knows this, even though I won't admit it.

Either you try to call me out and look stupid for it, or else you silently accept it. Either way, I win.

It is *weaponized* hypocrisy. Of course I'd want to hide this fact from myself.

---

Does this sound like something an unconscious mind does? Design astonishingly clever traps, and tune them in real time?

No. Something in you knows exactly what it's doing—even while hiding that knowledge from yourself.

---

Even if you were a fundamentally decent person, how would this behavior affect you? What would it do to your faith in humanity? Would you feel a greater resolution to stand by your own conscience, or defeated in a way that gives you permission to ignore it?

How many iterations of this before I could prove to myself that you don't *have* a conscience?

And once that happens, how will I get to feel about all my behavior leading up to that point?

What if it *doesn't* happen? What if, after several rounds of this, I'm still able to perceive something redeemable in you? It would mean I've been torturing innocence, and that... wouldn't feel great.

So the more I treat you this way, the more I need to be *damn sure* I get you all the way to the end.

What would the world look like if we were all busy doing this to each other, in some form or another?

---

If this were true, it would be the last possible thing I would want to know about myself. Because don't forget, this isn't accidental or unconscious. I'm doing this *consciously*, in a meaningful sense. And that just can't be.

So you can imagine how hard it would be to write a book whose whole point is to show it to you.

That's why I need your help.

---

Here's the core paradox.

You're a good person. Not as in everything you do is golden—but as in, at the very deepest level of your mind, you don't actually want to be doing this.

Is that true?

And yet there's a part of you that almost can't help it. It doesn't know how to stop.

So here you are, a fundamentally decent person, knowingly reinforcing evil in the world. And although this may be the first time you've brought that knowledge into full awareness, it was never truly hidden from you, was it?

So fundamentally decent people can knowingly commit great evil. What does that tell you about our culture's moral system—the fact that we harbor this collective belief that such evil can only be committed by *fundamentally defective* people?

Do you think it's about serving the truth—or perhaps serving our dark sides?

Maybe you're balking at the phrase "great evil." Sure, we may be reinforcing evil in others, but does that really qualify as great evil?

But you're starting to suspect that even the worst people may simply be lost in a deeper version of the same trap as the rest of us, right? And again, am I actually giving you new information here—or has part of you perhaps always known this, on some level?

If you somehow already knew this, it would mean that you've knowingly been keeping the most "vulnerable" people trapped for your own benefit.

Now is it starting to take shape?

---

## The Conspiracy

That cultural belief about morality—the one that enables our darkness, and prevents this whole sordid system from being exposed—how does it get so reliably maintained? Is there a secret cabal somewhere actively enforcing it? It's certainly not accidental, is it?

Let's ask it this way. If you *did* suspect an evil cabal, what would you feel about the people in charge? What would you spend your time doing? Working on the piddling amount of darkness in *yourself*? Why, when there are so much bigger fish to fry?

Think about this. If every one of us had an aspect of mind that desperately needed the truth to stay hidden—and that part were as devious and strategic as we've already laid out, with access to our conscious minds—is it a stretch to imagine that these parts could collectively find ways to remain hidden? Like how ants build colonies without explicit blueprints?

I'm not saying that no conspiracies exist. Obviously some do, and the people in charge are far more trapped in darkness than most. But the feeling of being the one standing outside it all, valiantly fighting it? That's the root conspiracy—the one from which all the rest are birthed, and which protects and sustains them all.

It's a distributed, emergent, self-organizing system—and you're one of its control nodes.

---

## Compassion

It's crucial to introduce some nuance at this point.

The most "evil" people—we've been calling them the most "vulnerable" or "trapped." Does this mean we're supposed to be *nice* to them?

No.

"Nice" is a trap. It doesn't hold people accountable.

Contempt says "you're knowingly doing this because you're inherently defective." Nice says "you didn't know, so you're innocent."

Both are missing the point. It's:

> *You're knowingly doing this, and I will do everything in my power to not only make you stop, but to make you see it.* 

And the only way to do that is by withholding all trace of cruelty—to give the dark part of others **absolutely nothing** to latch onto, to justify itself.

That's called compassion. It is the **only** weapon we have against the darkness—which is why we misunderstand it as something soft or weak. That part of our mind *needs* us to misunderstand it.

---

Here's what makes compassion so hard.

When confronting a "bad person," you don't just *think* they're bad—you can practically *feel* it; *see* it, can't you? And after contemning them, it's even more palpable.

You're not seeing *them*; you're seeing your projection of them.

Which part of you would have an incentive to alter your perception in this way?

And while you're contemning them, can you talk yourself out of it? No—all your thoughts seem to validate your perspective.

The part of our minds that enables evil: it does so by hijacking our entire cognitive apparatus—the very tools you would normally turn to to *detect* the subterfuge.

Thinking back on the "evil people" throughout history—isn't it obvious that this is where they were stuck?

You cannot think your way out of it, no matter how smart or clever or careful you think you're being. In fact, the more you think you can, the more surely you are trapped.

And yet there's a part of you that always knows. We've just learned to ignore it. In fact, we probably hardly even learned about it—except, perhaps, in Sunday school.

Again: which part of us would have an incentive to write this part off as religion or "woo"—the one part that could actually end the madness?

---

This is why our culture fetishizes intellect and rationality to such an extent—and why those tools don't seem to be up to the task of solving many of humanity's greatest challenges.

To the degree we're not connected to a deeper part of ourselves—one we'll explore soon, but that you can already intuit—those faculties are only in service to our delusions. They help us benefit ourselves at the world's expense, while giving us plausible deniability.

In other words, to the degree we're not free of the darkness in our own minds, it tends to infect basically everything we do.

---






When I correct you with integrity, I see your actions as bad, but I see you as redeemable. With contempt, I see *you* as bad—*fundamentally* defective; beyond help. It's an attack on your very being.

Stripped of all justifications, how does that *feel* to deliver?

Try this. Find an innocent person, and try to convey—with body language, tone, gaze, etc.—that they are *inherently defective.* Even if you couch it in sweet language, it still feels dirty, doesn't it? Both to you and to them.

Yet when you do it to a "bad person," it magically becomes *righteous*. But they still feel it as dirty, don't they?

Could that ever make a person better? Or could it only make them feel:

>***Fuck** you! Being nasty while pretending it's righteous—and you think you're going to get away with this? Yeah, I'll show you who's dark.*

And when they do, what does that tell you about them? What kind of person responds to righteousness in such a vile manner?

---

Okay, so maybe you let something dark slip that they picked up on—but surely that's an accident, right?

Well, let's see.

We've already established there's a part of you that wants **nothing** more than to violently punish evil, and you've just nudged your enemy one step closer to being the kind of person who can only be dealt with in that way—despite knowing there was a way that wouldn't cause this.

Does that seem like a coincidence? That there's a dark part of your mind that secretly wants this outcome, and a part that reliably creates it while telling you that you have no other choice?

And how are you going to treat them next time? With *less* contempt? And the time after?

---

Suppose there were an aspect of my mind that wanted this outcome—that was driving me toward situations in which I'd be "forced" to unleash the full extent of my righteous wrath.

It wouldn't come out and announce itself to me, would it? It would have to hide itself very cleverly—so cleverly that even if someone pointed at it very directly, I would resist seeing it.

It would encourage me to see certain people as "bad"—as if their misbehavior were of a fundamentally different nature than mine. This way I couldn't *help* but treat them with contempt.

Then, when some part of me tried to warn me that this was a terrible idea, it would drown out that warning with rationalizations of how *righteous* it was; how naive my conscience is. If it did this well enough, my dark behavior would literally *feel* righteous.

In other words, this part would lure me away from my better nature with clever seductions.

It would make sure my enemy saw this in my eyes, even as I was unable to recognize it myself. This would make them think:

>*You fucking hypocrite! I can literally **see** the darkness in you, even as you pretend it's something noble! And you're going to sit here and moralize me? Game on.*

This would drive them crazy; make them feel like they were looking at everything wrong with the world—so that they would feel morally *compelled* to stop me at any cost.

And this would tell me everything I needed to know about them.

My conscience really *was* naive to think that I could reason with such people. Maybe in an ideal world, but not out here in the real one.

---

## Ego?

Maybe you recognize this mechanism as "ego." But we normally think of my ego as something meant to protect me, right? Yet look at what it has caused.

My world has just become a bit darker. I will be more likely to hand this part of myself control in the future, while being less likely to notice that this is what I'm doing.

My enemy's world has become darker, too. In that world, are they more likely to be kind to others, or less? More likely to notice the self-serving aspects of their own behaviors, or to overlook them as necessary? And how will it affect all the people they pass this toxicity on to?

Why would my ego create a world in which not only are my enemies more dug in, but one which is generically darker? A world that authentically serves no one, but benefits all of our dark parts?

So it's not quite that—at least in the usual sense.

---

## The Parasite

Have you ever been so angry you didn't care what it destroyed—as long as it made them feel it?

While you were in that state, it felt like you were finally seeing clearly; cutting through all the noise, etc., right? But afterward, didn't it feel like "whoa, that wasn't me?" It's almost like you were *possessed*.

Here we have something that hides from me and doesn't feel like me, but occasionally lures me away from my better nature. When I'm turned away, it "possesses" me—at which point it *does* feel like me, so that I gladly create a world that's more hospitable to it, but less hospitable to us.

What does that sound like to you?

**It is a parasite, and I am its host.**

When I treat you with contempt, my parasite is revealing itself to you while hiding itself from me—and this powerfully invites yours to take control of you, which it reliably does. The result is that they each colonize our minds further; increasingly feeling like *us*—while leaving us more certain that *we're* the ones in charge.

In other words, yours and mine aren't fighting—they're secretly allied, while making us *believe* we're fighting.

---

You don't just *think* your enemies are bad; you can practically *see* it; *feel* it. And the worse they become, the more obvious this is, right?

And what's going through your mind as you're contemning them? Even if you *know* it's a bad idea, isn't your mind overrun with thoughts about how good it will be?

Your parasite doesn't just lure you away from your better nature with a single thought and then stop—it is continually manipulating your thoughts and perceptions, so that you can't help but do what it wants.

And it doesn't just do this while you're in the state of contempt. Even right now, you're primed to feel it for your enemies, aren't you? And to think of them in a certain way? It's in partial control right now.

A person stuck in a very deep version of that trap—what would they look like?

How could they ever think themselves out of it?

How would the world treat them?

And how would they be likely to react?

---









Let's leave aside the question of the nature of this parasite—whether it's a "real thing" or just an aspect of our psyches—and return to it later. For now, let's explore how it works.

---

## The Mechanism

Have you ever been on the receiving end of a dehumanizing gaze? Doesn't it feel like the person is somehow "turned away from themselves?" Malice naturally emanates from that state, doesn't it? They don't have to *do* anything to project it. 

What you're seeing is their parasite in control.

Do they know they're in this state?

Well, do *you* know it when delivering contempt?

---

The answer is *yes and no.*

There's a part of you that knows perfectly well what you're doing—and yet that knowledge is somehow not accessible to you. Limbo.

Yet I can see in your eyes that you know—because you *do*. But you refuse to admit it, and this maddens me to no end.

The fact that you're hiding from yourself *is* what's revealed to me.

*The hiding is the revealing.*

Which means that—unless I'm aware of this trap—you handing your parasite control is enough to make me do the same.

*This is how the darkness spreads.*

---

Try and recall how *certain* you feel when contemning your enemies. You can't just reason yourself out of that state, can you? Why not?

You don't just *think* your enemies are bad; you can practically *see* it; *feel* it. And the worse they become, the more obvious this is.

The parasite doesn't just lure you away with a single thought and then stop—it continually manipulates your thoughts and perceptions. It hijacks your entire cognitive apparatus—which are also the very tools you'd need to detect the subterfuge. 

The more it's in control, the more certain that *you* are—and anyone who tries to talk you out of it seems naive, stupid, or... evil.

The manipulation is strongest while it's actively in control, but it doesn't just stop when it goes dormant—it changes your baseline. It is *always* influencing how you see and think about the world.

---

If a person were *fully* infected—so that they were flawlessly convinced that their incredibly harmful behavior was actually righteous—how would they look? How would I treat them?

They would look evil, of course—and I would gleefully shove them deeper in.

If they were truly, inherently evil, then why would they look "turned away"? Why would they need to turn away from what they truly are to cause harm? What are they turning away *from*?

If I were lost in that state myself, how would I ever know it?

Could it be a matter of degree, and not kind?

---

## Fighting Evil

Make no mistake: evil must be fought—fiercely; even violently when necessary. But to the degree I perceive myself as *inherently superior* to others, I cannot help but create more evil while convinced I'm valiantly fighting it.

We'll look at how to address that later, but for now: if part of me (consciously) knows I'm doing this, why do I let it continue? What am I getting out of it? Sure, I crave that delicious feeling of violently punishing evil, but even that lies downstream of a much deeper need.

Let's ask it this way: are there uncomfortable aspects of yourself that you're not ready to admit to yourself—let alone let the world see?

A world full of corrupt and despicable people—as much as you hate it, does such a world make it easier or harder to keep those aspects of yourself hidden?

How painful would it be to learn that the worst people of the world—the ones you hate—are in a profound sense not all that different from you?

---

The truth is, I need **so badly** to know that darkness exists only outside myself that I will do anything to prove it—including creating it in others, so that I can point at them and say "see?"

But I cannot do this to just anybody. My self-image as a *good person* prevents it. I must divide the world into the *fundamentally* good and bad people; those who deserve my compassion and those who deserve my contempt. That way, I know who it's good to harm.

Deep down, I know this line is arbitrary—that we're all caught in different versions and depths of the same trap, and that it's horrible to shove anyone deeper into it. In fact, if anything, it's *worse* to shove the "bad people" in, because they're the most lost of all of us, and most likely to remain trapped.

But I must never allow this knowledge into conscious awareness, because what would it say about me if I've always known this? So my only option is to double down on my self-deception. As awful as it is to keep the "bad people" trapped, it's the only way I can prove that this deep aspect of mind—the one that sees our similarity—is **wrong**.

I must block people from reaching the light to prove that they never had any hope of finding it.

---

I must never become fully aware I'm doing this, for obvious reasons. But if I weren't conscious of it at all, how could I even do it? It can't be handed off to my unconscious mind, because the unconscious cannot strategize and adapt in real time, like I need it to.

That is the purpose of the limbo state. One part of me must consciously know what I'm doing, while it's hidden behind countless layers of justification—the only things I "consciously" hear.

> *I'm not trying to make them hurt! Okay I am, but it's just to help them see how bad they are, so that they change!
>  
> Okay, maybe I'm flashing them my own darkness—but it's only to show them what I'm really capable of! To frighten them into stopping.
> 
> Okay fine, maybe I'm provoking their darkness—but I'm only revealing what's already there, not creating more! That's helpful!
> 
> And anyway, my darkness isn't real darkness; it's just strategic—the kind all "good people" must harbor to fight evil!*

The limbo state is a feature, not a bug.

## The Specific Harm

There's something uniquely insidious about contempt.

Look at it this way: what's the actual harm it causes? It's not physical pain. It's not even emotional pain. It's not that I make you feel bad.

By revealing my darkness to you while pretending it's good, I convey a subtle message:

> *See? Even the so-called "good people" are ultimately frauds, willing to abandon the light when they know they can get away with it. We all know where the **real** power lies.*

I'm showing you that true goodness is a myth. What makes it land so hard is that you can see the part of me that is actively doing this—that it's not an accident. If it were accidental or unconscious, I would be confused or embarrassed when you pointed it out. Instead, I actively work to maintain the facade.

This produces a kind of hall-of-mirrors effect, where we both know what's really happening, and that the other knows, etc., but neither of us can name it. Have you felt that before?

It's like I've opened a channel directly into the deepest part of your psyche, and am injecting darkness in a way that nobody can prove. I've got plausible deniability, and we both know it.

It is the *perfect crime*—how the parasite transmits itself without leaving a trace of evidence behind. It is a *covert* form of evil—making it much harder to eradicate than overt forms.

---

When phrased this way, it makes me sound pretty evil, doesn't it?

But the deepest part of me—the part *beneath* the parasite—does **not** want to be doing this. To the degree I think of this as who I really am, I will always feel a deep shame—because part of me knows I *am* doing it—which will prevent me from getting a closer look at what's really happening. This is why the parasite wants me to believe that it *is* me—it is how it stays hidden.

That dark message I conveyed doesn't come from me, but from *it*. Its purpose is not to harm you, but to give yours a reason to ingratiate itself further to you. In this way, it is like a *secret handshake* between yours and mine—and this is something you can learn to sense.

And this doesn't just happen between me and my enemies. When I'm in the state of contempt in the presence of my "allies"—don't I induce the same state in them? My parasite doesn't care whose mind it's darkening, as long as it's darkening minds; making them forget who they are.

---

## The Light

On the other hand, when someone fights you with integrity, doesn't it feel like they're reminding you of something you've temporarily forgotten? It's like they're showing you: *this isn't who you really are.* They're refusing to see the parasite as you—and *that* is what breaks you free of its spell.

Doesn't it feel almost like such a person is an external manifestation of your own conscience?Something you know you can't win against—and more importantly, that you don't *want* to? They can only do this to the degree that they're free of their own parasite. They can't give what they don't have.

It is like a secret handshake between the aspect of Light in each of us. This is how it begins to mount a defense against our true nemesis.

The reason it feels like ours are pulling in the "same direction," even if we have different ideologies, is that they're encouraging us to see the world through fewer filters—and the more clearly we see the world, the more we naturally feel gratitude and awe for it all. In this state, we can't help but desire what's best for all—and to have humility in finding the best path forward.

We'll explore this more fully later.

## The Real Fight

The mythical fight between good and evil—it's very much real, but it doesn't work like in the storybooks. It's not a fight between fundamentally good and bad people: in fact, that framing is a key trick of the darkness. It's fought between these aspects within each of us—our "true selves" and our impostors.

My true allies aren't the people who share my beliefs and agendas—it's the Light in everyone. My true enemies aren't actually other people—it's this dark "force" encouraging us all to forget.

Every action you take is in service to one side or the other, and the only way to know for sure which one you're serving is to remember the deepest part of yourself—a part that the parasite can imitate, but never truly supplant.

---
---

## Interlude

Nothing we've said in this chapter—except perhaps for the framing devices—is actually new to you. If you recognize it, it's because it's been there in limbo for you the whole time.

All of it is consciously accessible in the moment of contempt—but at progressively deeper layers of hiding.

I know, even while contemning you, that you're only able to cause harm for the same reason I am—that it's not the "real you."

Which means that I know I'm harming a fundamentally innocent person—someone who's lost in countless layers of pain and confusion, just as I am.

What does it feel like to take active pleasure in harming innocence? It feels **malevolent**—like the distilled essence of *all the evil there ever was.*

Which is why I have to hide it from myself so. Fucking. Hard.

And part of you senses that I'm doing this—which is why you must rebel.

And I *know* that's why you're rebelling. Which is why I have to smother your cries in such a way that nobody will recognize them for what they really are.

**That's** the darkness you're seeing in my eyes. It's a recursive hiding—that hall of mirrors.

This is how my desperate need to see you as "other" becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy.
