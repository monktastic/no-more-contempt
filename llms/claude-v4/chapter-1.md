# Chapter I: Contempt
## Conscience

Have you ever done something you knew was wrong at the time, but couldn't fully admit it to yourself until later? Maybe you made a cruel comment to boost your ego, took credit for someone else's work, or cheated on a test (or even partner).

While you were doing it, one part of you knew it was wrong, while another was busy producing justifications for why it wasn't "really" wrong. Notice the asymmetry: the part that knew—your conscience—wasn't trying to justify itself. It just... was.

You knew that voice would win out in the end, but convinced yourself you could somehow override it—that if you decided your rationalizations were sound, then they would be, and that was that. After all, *you* are the final arbiter of right and wrong in your own mind.

But some part of you knew this was a lie, too...

---
## Limbo

At some point, realization of your self-deception broke through into conscious awareness in a way that you could no longer suppress. Didn't you already know this was coming?

Where had that knowledge been hiding until then?

Was it *unconscious?* No. Looking back, can you see that it had always been available to your conscious mind? You had just chosen not to look.

Consider how strange this is—that there can be knowledge hidden in your *conscious mind* that you somehow aren't seeing. Not because you *can't*, but because you *won't*.

Such knowledge exists in a kind of *limbo state*—a bizarre, paradoxical schism of mind in which we simultaneously know something and yet somehow don't... until one day we realize we always had. And it's not binary: this state exists along a continuum.

What would the world look like if all of humanity were lost in some version of limbo nearly all the time—if we weren't being completely honest with ourselves about our true intentions?

What would it look like if we stopped?

## Contempt and Integrity

Think back to a moment you felt contemptuously judged by another person. No matter how "right" they may have been; even if you *knew* you had done wrong, something felt *off* about them, didn't it? You could tell they weren't coming from a good place. How?

Now think of a time when someone set you straight with profound integrity—seemingly getting nothing out of it themselves. Even if it stung your ego; made you lose face, you had no desire to take revenge, did you? Why not? What could you tell they were in service to?

Now turn it around.

Think of a time when *you* contemptuously judged someone—perhaps mocking or shaming them. Even if you tried to hide your contempt, they still dug in their heels, didn't they? And somewhere inside, that resistance confirmed what you already believed.

And finally, a time when you corrected someone with integrity yourself. Perhaps you had to do it with more ferocity; more violence than in the previous case—and yet something in you knew it would ultimately bring more peace. *How* did you know?

---

That time you stood in integrity, and the time the person who corrected you did: even if you knew nothing else about them—their politics, their religion, their creed—didn't it feel like you were somehow serving the same thing, beyond personal interests? What is that?

And the time you stood in contempt, and were treated with contempt: didn't it feel like *those* were somehow serving the same thing? Not just your individual egos, either.

Integrity feels clean from both the inside and outside.

Contempt feels righteous inside but dark, dirty, insincere from the outside.

There's a reason for that distinction—and seeing it clearly changed everything for me.

---
## How Contempt Works

When I correct you with integrity, I see your actions as bad, but I see you as redeemable. With contempt, I see *you* as bad—*fundamentally* defective; irredeemable. It's an attack on your very being.

Stripped of all justifications, how does that *feel* to deliver?

Try this. Find an innocent person, and try to convey—with body language, tone, gaze, etc.—that they are *inherently defective.* Even if you couch it in sweet language, it still feels dirty, doesn't it? Both to you and to them.

Does that feeling disappear when you do it to a "bad person"? They still feel it, don't they? How?

Could that feeling ever make a person better? Or could it only make them feel:

>***Fuck** you! Being nasty while pretending it's righteous—and you think you're going to get away with this? Yeah, I'll show you who's dark.*

Doesn't this make them *more* likely to ignore their own conscience? And what does it tell you about them when they do? What kind of person reacts to noble intentions with such darkness?

---

I must be letting something dark slip when I treat you with contempt, but how? Is it an accident?

Well, let's see.

We've already established there's a part of me that wants **nothing** more than to violently punish evil, and I've just nudged you one step closer to being the kind of person who can only be dealt with in that way—despite knowing there was a way that wouldn't cause this.

Does that seem like a coincidence? That there's a dark part of my mind that secretly wants this outcome, and a part that reliably creates it? 

Or is this exactly the kind of thing it would *want* me to think is a coincidence, so that I would never ponder it too deeply?

And am I going to treat you with *less* contempt next time? And the time after?

---

Suppose, for a moment, that there really were an aspect of my mind trying to drive me toward Armageddon—situations where both my enemy and I are "forced" to unleash the full extent of our righteous wrath.

It wouldn't come out and announce itself to me, would it? It would have to hide itself very cleverly—so cleverly that even if someone pointed at it very directly, I would resist seeing it.

It would encourage me to see certain people as "bad"—as if their misbehavior was of a fundamentally different nature than mine. This way I couldn't *help* but treat them with contempt.

Then, when some part of me tried to warn me that this was a terrible idea, it would drown out that warning with rationalizations of how *righteous* it was; how naive my conscience is.

In other words, it would lure me away from my better nature by making darkness feel *delicious.*

It would make sure my enemy saw this in my eyes, even as I was unable to recognize it myself. This would make them think:

>*You fucking hypocrite! I can literally **see** the darkness in you, even as you pretend it's something noble! And you're going to sit here and moralize me? Game on.*

This would drive them crazy; make them feel like they were looking at everything wrong with the world—making them feel morally *compelled* to stop me at any cost.

And this would seal the trap shut, by showing me that this person is truly beyond help. After all, if this is how they react to righteous behavior, just think of what they're capable of.

My conscience really *was* naive to think that I could reason with such people. Maybe in an ideal world, but not out here in the real one.

---

## Ego?

My world has just become a bit darker. I will be more likely to hand this part of myself control in the future, while being less likely to notice that this is what I'm doing.

Maybe you recognize this mechanism as "ego." But we normally think of my ego as something meant to protect me, right? Yet look at what it has caused.

After this interaction, my enemy's world has become darker, too. In that world, are they more likely to be kind to others, or less? More likely to notice the self-serving aspects of their own behaviors, or to overlook them as necessary? What about all the people they pass this toxicity on to? Are they likely to become better people?

Why is my ego creating a world in which not only are my enemies more dug in, but one which is generically darker? A world that authentically serves no one, but benefits all of our dark parts?

Whatever this part of us is, yours and mine don't seem to be fighting. They seem to be empowering each other while making us *believe* we're fighting.

But what are they?

---

## The Parasite

Have you ever been so angry you didn't care what it destroyed—as long as it made them feel it?

While you were in that state, it felt like you were finally seeing clearly; cutting through all the noise, etc., right? But afterward, didn't it feel like "whoa, that wasn't me?" It's almost like you were *possessed*.

Here we have something that hides from me and doesn't feel like me, but occasionally lures me away from my better nature. When I'm turned away, it "possesses" me—at which point it *does* feel like me, so that I gladly create a world that's more hospitable to it, but less hospitable to us.

What does that sound like to you?

**It is a parasite, and we are its hosts.**

When I treat you with contempt, my parasite is revealing itself to you while hiding itself from me—and this powerfully invites yours to take control of you, which it reliably does. The result is that they each colonize our minds further; increasingly feeling like *us*—while leaving us more certain that *we're* the ones in charge.

---

Let's leave aside the question of the nature of this parasite—whether it's a "real thing" or just an aspect of our psyches—and return to it later. For now, let's explore how it works.

---

## The Mechanism

Have you ever been on the receiving end of a dehumanizing gaze? Doesn't it feel like the person is somehow "turned away" from themselves? Malice naturally emanates from that state, doesn't it? They don't have to *do* anything to project it. 

That's what it looks like for the parasite to be in control.

Do they know they're in this state?

Well, do *you* know it when delivering contempt?

---

The answer is *yes and no.*

There's a part of you that knows perfectly well what you're doing—and yet that knowledge is somehow not accessible to you. Limbo.

Yet I can see in your eyes that you know—because you *do*. But you refuse to admit it, and this maddens me to no end.

The fact that you're hiding from yourself *is* what's revealed to me.

*The hiding is the revealing.*

Which means that—unless I'm aware of this trap—you handing your parasite control is enough to make me do the same.

*This is how the darkness spreads.*

---

Try and recall how *certain* you feel when contemning your enemies. You can't just reason yourself out of that state, can you? Why not?

You don't just *think* your enemies are bad; you can practically *see* it; *feel* it. And the worse they become, the more obvious this is.

The parasite doesn't just lure you away with a single thought and then stop—it continually manipulates your thoughts and perceptions. It hijacks your entire cognitive apparatus—which are also the very tools you'd need to detect the subterfuge. 

The more it's in control, the more certain that *you* are—and anyone who tries to talk you out of it seems naive, stupid, or... evil.

The manipulation is strongest while it's actively in control, but it doesn't just stop when it goes dormant—it changes your baseline. It is *always* influencing how you see and think about the world.

---

If a person were *fully* infected—so that they were flawlessly convinced that their incredibly harmful behavior was actually righteous—how would they look? How would I treat them?

They would look evil, of course—and I would gleefully shove them deeper in.

If they were truly, inherently evil, then why would they look "turned away"? Why would they need to turn away from what they truly are to cause harm? What are they turning away *from*?

If I were lost in that state myself, how would I ever know it?

Could it be a matter of degree, and not kind?

---

## Fighting Evil

Make no mistake: evil must be fought—fiercely; even violently when necessary. But to the degree I perceive myself as *inherently superior* to others, I cannot help but create more evil while convinced I'm valiantly fighting it.

We'll look at how to address that later, but for now: if part of me (consciously) knows I'm doing this, why do I let it continue? What am I getting out of it? Sure, I crave that delicious feeling of violently punishing evil, but even that lies downstream of a much deeper need.

Let's ask it this way: are there uncomfortable aspects of yourself that you're not ready to admit to yourself—let alone let the world see?

A world full of corrupt and despicable people—as much as you hate it, does such a world make it easier or harder to keep those aspects of yourself hidden?

How painful would it be to learn that the worst people of the world—the ones you hate—are in a profound sense not all that different from you?

---

The truth is, I need **so badly** to know that darkness exists only outside myself that I will do anything to prove it—including creating it in others, so that I can point at them and say "see?"

But I cannot do this to just anybody. My self-image as a *good person* prevents it. I must divide the world into the *fundamentally* good and bad people; those who deserve my compassion and those who deserve my contempt. That way, I know who it's good to harm.

Deep down, I know this line is arbitrary—that we're all caught in different versions and depths of the same trap, and that it's horrible to shove anyone deeper into it. In fact, if anything, it's *worse* to shove the "bad people" in, because they're the most lost of all of us, and most likely to remain trapped.

But I must never allow this knowledge into conscious awareness, because what would it say about me if I've always known this? So my only option is to double down on my self-deception. As awful as it is to keep the "bad people" trapped, it's the only way I can prove that this deep aspect of mind—the one that sees our similarity—is **wrong**.

I must block people from reaching the light to prove that they never had any hope of finding it.

---

I must never become fully aware I'm doing this, for obvious reasons. But if I weren't conscious of it at all, how could I even do it? It can't be handed off to my unconscious mind, because the unconscious cannot strategize and adapt in real time, like I need it to.

That is the purpose of the limbo state. One part of me must consciously know what I'm doing, while it's hidden behind countless layers of justification—the only things I "consciously" hear.

> *I'm not trying to make them hurt! Okay I am, but it's just to help them see how bad they are, so that they change!
>  
> Okay, maybe I'm flashing them my own darkness—but it's only to show them what I'm really capable of! To frighten them into stopping.
> 
> Okay fine, maybe I'm provoking their darkness—but I'm only revealing what's already there, not creating more! That's helpful!
> 
> And anyway, my darkness isn't real darkness; it's just strategic—the kind all "good people" must harbor to fight evil!*

The limbo state is a feature, not a bug.

---

## The Specific Harm

There's something uniquely insidious about contempt.

Look at it this way: what's the actual harm it causes? It's not physical pain. It's not even emotional pain. It's not that I make you feel bad.

By revealing my darkness to you while pretending it's good, I convey a subtle message:

> *See? Even the so-called "good people" are ultimately frauds, willing to abandon the light when they know they can get away with it. We all know where the **real** power lies.*

I'm showing you that true goodness is a myth. What makes it land so hard is that you can see the part of me that is actively doing this—that it's not an accident. If it were accidental or unconscious, I would be confused or embarrassed when you pointed it out. Instead, I actively work to maintain the facade.

This produces a kind of hall-of-mirrors effect, where we both know what's really happening, and that the other knows, etc., but neither of us can name it. Have you felt that before?

It's like I've opened a channel directly into the deepest part of your psyche, and am injecting darkness in a way that nobody can prove. I've got plausible deniability, and we both know it.

It is the *perfect crime*—how the parasite transmits itself without leaving a trace of evidence behind. It is a *covert* form of evil—making it much harder to eradicate than overt forms.

---

When phrased this way, it makes me sound pretty evil, doesn't it?

But the deepest part of me—the part *beneath* the parasite—does **not** want to be doing this. To the degree I think of this as who I really am, I will always feel a deep shame—because part of me knows I *am* doing it—which will prevent me from getting a closer look at what's really happening. This is why the parasite wants me to believe that it *is* me—it is how it stays hidden.

That dark message I conveyed doesn't come from me, but from *it*. Its purpose is not to harm you, but to give yours a reason to ingratiate itself further to you. In this way, it is like a *secret handshake* between yours and mine—and this is something you can learn to sense.

And this doesn't just happen between me and my enemies. When I'm in the state of contempt in the presence of my "allies"—don't I induce the same state in them? My parasite doesn't care whose mind it's darkening, as long as it's darkening minds; making them forget who they are.

---

## The Light

On the other hand, when someone fights you with integrity, doesn't it feel like they're reminding you of something you've temporarily forgotten? It's like they're showing you: *this isn't who you really are.* They're refusing to see the parasite as you—and *that* is what breaks you free of its spell.

Doesn't it feel almost like such a person is an external manifestation of your own conscience?Something you know you can't win against—and more importantly, that you don't *want* to? They can only do this to the degree that they're free of their own parasite. They can't give what they don't have.

It is like a secret handshake between the aspect of Light in each of us. This is how it begins to mount a defense against our true nemesis.

The reason it feels like ours are pulling in the "same direction," even if we have different ideologies, is that they're encouraging us to see the world through fewer filters—and the more clearly we see the world, the more we naturally feel gratitude and awe for it all. In this state, we can't help but desire what's best for all—and to have humility in finding the best path forward.

We'll explore this more fully later.

---

## The Real Fight

The mythical fight between good and evil—it's very much real, but it doesn't work like in the storybooks. It's not a fight between fundamentally good and bad people: in fact, that framing is a key trick of the darkness. It's fought between these aspects within each of us—our "true selves" and our impostors.

My true allies aren't the people who share my beliefs and agendas—it's the Light in everyone. My true enemies aren't actually other people—it's this dark "force" encouraging us all to forget.

Every action you take is in service to one side or the other, and the only way to know for sure which one you're serving is to remember the deepest part of yourself—a part that the parasite can imitate, but never truly supplant.

---
---

## Interlude

Nothing we've said in this chapter—except perhaps for the framing devices—is actually new to you. If you recognize it, it's because it's been there in limbo for you the whole time.

All of it is consciously accessible in the moment of contempt—but at progressively deeper layers of hiding.

I know, even while contemning you, that you're only able to cause harm for the same reason I am—that it's not the "real you."

Which means that I know I'm harming a fundamentally innocent person—someone who's lost in countless layers of pain and confusion, just as I am.

What does it feel like to take active pleasure in harming innocence? It feels **malevolent**—like the distilled essence of *all the evil there ever was.*

Which is why I have to hide it from myself so. Fucking. Hard.

And part of you senses that I'm doing this—which is why you must rebel.

And I *know* that's why you're rebelling. Which is why I have to smother your cries in such a way that nobody will recognize them for what they really are.

**That's** the darkness you're seeing in my eyes. It's a recursive hiding—that hall of mirrors.

This is how my desperate need to see you as "other" becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy.
