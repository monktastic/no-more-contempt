# Part 1: The Mechanism

When someone's genuinely working for the benefit of others, you can tell—whether they're doing it gently or using great force. How?

And when someone's only *telling* themselves they're doing good, that has a distinct flavor too. It feels *contemptuous*, even if only very subtly.

From the inside, both people might describe feeling "righteous." Yet from the outside, one feels transparent and authentic, while the other feels dirty, disingenuous.

Why the discrepancy?

---

Two people acting out of complete integrity—yet with different politics, religions, or creeds—seem oriented toward the same larger goal, don’t they? What is that?

And two people acting out of contempt: they may be bitter rivals on the surface, yet they, too, are serving the same thing—something that slowly degrades the social fabric.

Now notice how two behaviors that look nearly identical from the outside—say, scolding someone with integrity vs. contempt—are likely to produce dramatically different long-term results, even if both solve the short-term problem.

So: if feeling righteous is no indicator of what we're serving, and it's nearly impossible to detect by behavior—how can we be sure which one we're serving?

---

There's no way you can simply *talk* someone out of being evil, right? There's a kind of internal coherence to their worldview that prevents them from detecting the problem.

Which means that if we were in that state, there'd be no way to simply think ourselves out of it. 

And what if it's not binary, but a continuum? What if every one of us is in some version of it right now?

---

These difficulties—the inability to detect our own darkness through feelings, thoughts, or behaviors—are not by accident. Just consider how much harder it would be for you to cause harm if it were obvious to you.

So whatever it is in our minds that enables it—if you'll allow me to anthropomorphize it—has a different agenda from yours and evades detection.

Moreover: when you treat others with contempt, are they *more* or *less* likely to do the same to others? So this thing also spreads itself. 

It's beginning to sound almost like a parasite.

So the whole thing isn't as simple as: "Okay, so I create a little darkness sometimes. I'll work on it."

I want to show you how mine wasn't just creating a little darkness here and there—it was continually scanning for opportunities to reinforce it in others, while keeping itself hidden from me.

These difficulties—the inability to detect our own darkness through feelings, thoughts, or behaviors—are not by accident. The dark part of our minds depends on them to evade detection. That's the only way it can survive in us.

And this isn't just an individual problem: methods exist for detecting the darkness in ourselves, but none have really taken root in our culture, have they? In fact, you might not even be aware that such things exist. That's not an accident.

It's obvious that there's darkness operating at scale in our society. If that collective darkness worked similarly to how it does in individuals, wouldn't it have an "incentive" to evade detection, too?

---



Think of a time someone scolded you with contempt. No matter how "right" they were; even if you knew you were in the wrong, you could tell they weren't coming from a good place, right? How?

What about a time someone set you straight with integrity? Even if it stung your ego; made you lose face: you had no desire for revenge, did you? What could you tell they were serving?

Now flip it around.

Think of a time you felt contempt for someone—when you were *sure* they were wrong, bad, deserved to feel it. Even if you tried to be civil about it, they still dug in their heels, didn't they? What did that tell you about them?

And finally, a time you corrected someone out of fierce integrity. Even if you had to use force—maybe even violence—something in you knew this would lead to more peace, not less. How did you know?

---

What you were serving in your moment of integrity, and what the person who set you straight was serving: even if you knew nothing else about them—their politics, their religion, their creed—didn't it feel like you were both serving the same thing? What is that?

And in those moments of contempt—didn't those feel like they were serving the same thing, too? What's *that*?

Integrity feels clean from the inside and outside.

Contempt feels righteous on the inside, but dark, dirty, manipulative on the outside.

Why the discrepancy?

---

It's almost as if there are two different "forces" we can serve in any moment: the Light or the darkness. (The reason for the difference in capitalization will become clear later. It's not just an affectation.)

It's not always obvious which force is being served when. Serving the Light often looks "nice," but sometimes being nice secretly serves the dark—such as when we're aiding and abetting. Violence is usually a sign of darkness, but there are times it's needed by the Light.

There's no simple rule you can follow—no behavioral checklist that guarantees you're serving the Light. Can you feel how that ambiguity serves only the darkness?

Our minds are sometimes filled with justifications of the form "wellll... I can tell myself this isn't *really* wrong, because..." But are they ever filled with "welll... I can pretend this isn't really *right*, because...?"

Of course not. And do you think there's anyone who lies to themselves so they can sneak around doing *good*? Why the asymmetry? 

And does the lack of an explicit guidance system mean there's *no* way to know whether we're really serving the Light?

---

When you were corrected with integrity, didn't it feel like they were *reminding* you of something—something you already knew about yourself but temporarily forgot? There was a feeling of "*I know you're better than this*."

But when treated with contempt, it's more like they're trying to *convince* you of something.

You *know* you're not bad—even if you sometimes do wrong. And it's not even that you're a mixture of good and bad parts, exactly. It's more like the deepest part of you wants to serve the Light, but sometimes this awful world makes that really hard, right?

What if it ultimately works that way for *everyone?*

No, I'm not about to tell you to be nice to Hitler, or that everyone should be treated the same. I want to show you why *not* recognizing this is how the darkness gets its foot in the door, and how, from there, it begins to imitate the Light—until you can no longer tell them apart.

---

Notice I said not *recognizing* this. I didn't say not *believing* it. If you simply *believe* that everyone is basically good, you can end up enabling a lot of evil.

But the more connected you are to your own Light, the more clearly you can see it in others. Not as an idea, but as a kind of perception.

For example, the more you know about someone's story, the easier it is to see why their poor choices aren't the result of some inherent moral deficiency, right? Nothing shifted outwardly, but it's as if you literally *see* something in them you couldn't before—a part of them that wants to be *free* of the confusion. It's not mystical, but completely natural.

And the more kinds of people you do this with, the more this perception extends beyond just those particular people. You begin to see patterns of pain, confusion, insecurity that are common across humanity. 

This kind of empathy doesn't make you more naive, but quite the opposite: you're much more effective at combating misbehavior, because you're able to get to root causes.

But this isn't just a book about how to be kind, so let's take this deeper.

---

If you laid out all humans from most saintly to most evil, there's some point beyond which you can no longer see any Light in them. At that point, the desire to even *look* for the Light fades into the background—and something dark takes over.

You don't just want to *stop* them anymore. You want them to *suffer.* To feel the weight of how bad they are.



---






Because once you believe someone is *fundamentally* different from you—not just confused or lost, but inherently bad—then treating them as less important becomes justified. Not just tactically (sometimes you do have to stop people), but morally. And that justification? That's the seed of every atrocity. That's the move that lets ordinary people participate in genocides while feeling righteous.
