## Conscience

Have you ever done something you knew was wrong at the time, but couldn't fully admit it to yourself until later? Maybe you made a cruel comment to boost your ego, took credit for someone else's work, or cheated on a test (or even partner).

While you were doing it, wasn't one part of you—your conscience—telling you it was wrong, while another was busy producing justifications for why it wasn't *really* wrong?

Notice an asymmetry here: your conscience wasn't trying to justify itself. It just... *was*. The part providing justifications wasn't trying to convince *it*; it was trying to convince *you*—that your conscience was just one more voice among the noise.

But it isn't.

We *know* we can't win a direct confrontation with our conscience. All we can do is find better ways of ignoring it.

So you did—and yet some part of you sensed this wouldn't end well, didn't it?

## Limbo

You might have convinced yourself you didn't "really" know it was wrong, right up until you were able to admit it—at which point you saw that you *always had*.

Notice this: both halves—the undeniable wrongness and the conviction of rightness—were actually conscious **the entire time**. Not hidden in some unconscious realm waiting to emerge. Right there. You just kept your attention carefully turned away.

That knowledge existed in a kind of "limbo state": a bizarre schism of mind in which we know something—*consciously*—and yet are **sure** we don't... until we retroactively discover that we always did.

It's a profound form of self-deception, but we don't do it because we're "bad people." Ignoring our conscience is a kind of defense against a world we perceive as hostile, rightly or wrongly. In ourselves, it feels like an innocent flaw—forgivable, given all we've seen and faced. But when others do it? We see them as inherently bad.

## Contempt and Integrity

Think back to a moment you felt contemptuously judged by another person. No matter how "right" they may have been; even if you *knew* you had done wrong, something felt *off* about them, didn't it? You could tell they weren't coming from a good place. How?

Now think of a time when someone set you straight with profound integrity—seemingly getting nothing out of it themselves. Even if it stung your ego; made you lose face, you had no desire to take revenge, did you? Why not? What could you tell they were serving?

Now turn it around.

Think of a time when *you* contemptuously judged someone. Even if you tried to hide your contempt, they still dug in their heels, didn't they? And somewhere inside, that resistance confirmed what you already believed.

And finally, a time when you corrected someone with integrity yourself. Perhaps you had to do it with more ferocity; more violence than in the previous case—and yet something in you knew it would ultimately bring *more* peace. *How* did you know?

---

That time you stood in integrity, and the time the person who corrected you did: even if you knew nothing else about them—their politics, their religion, their creed—didn't it feel like you were somehow serving the same thing? What is that?

And the time you stood in contempt, and were treated with contempt: didn't it feel like *those* were somehow serving the same thing? Not just your personal egos, either.

Integrity feels clean from both the inside and outside.

Contempt feels righteous inside but dark, dirty, insincere from the outside.

There's a reason for that distinction—and seeing it clearly changed everything for me.

## How Contempt Works

Here's what I saw.

When I mock or shame my enemies and they dig in, my response is mixed. On one level, I feel dismayed: *damn, they really are as bad as I feared*. But on another, I feel a certain satisfaction: *see, they really are as bad as I feared!*

Did I go into it expecting this satisfaction? Of course not—that would make me a bad person!

And yet, on the receiving end, you somehow feel it, don't you? That I want to prove how bad you are, even while I claim I'm only trying to help?

*Of course* there was a part of me that wanted this outcome, even as I did it—I just couldn’t admit it to myself. I'd like to call it "unconscious," but that's not quite right. It was just in limbo.

And lo and behold: it worked: my *hidden intention* for you to dig in was enough to bring it about. 

But how? How did you perceive something about me that I barely knew about myself—unless *part of me was somehow showing it to you?*

Now, I want to be clear about this: it's not that I *consciously* wanted you to see it. Except here's the thing: the medicine showed me exactly where this knowledge had been lurking in my conscious mind the whole time. My intention for you to see it *was* conscious—just more deeply hidden than my mere *hope* it would happen.

And it gets worse.

Anyone who's been on the receiving end of contempt knows that this will be the result—that it makes us feel worse. So we also know it on the delivering end—it's just more deeply hidden. Part of me (consciously) knew in advance it was going to work, and I did it anyway. Doesn't that sound like an *intention*?

Moreover, don't I already know there's a way to correct people that *doesn't* cause this to happen?

So what did my contempt *add*, exactly?

Your digging in wasn't accidental, and it wasn't just an unfortunate side-effect of my good intentions: **it was secretly the whole point.** I was just telling myself pretty stories about how good it would be—and buying them so completely that they became "true" for me.

Which meant that when you did dig in, I could use it against you. Because not only did you fight back against my righteous behavior—proving how bad you are—you were implicitly accusing *me* of being the bad one. How *dare* you. This world is even worse than I thought—licensing me to ignore my conscience even more.

And in case you didn't see this coming: *part of me knew that, too. The whole thing was a fiendish ruse that would allow me to feel less guilty about disobeying my own conscience. That was the big payoff.*

*Something in me revealed itself to you to license more darkness in me.*

And, to cinch the trap: part of me knows this, too—and it's so dark that I must **never** allow it into conscious awareness.

Let that sit for a moment.

## Plausible Deniability

It's difficult to unfold all the layers of this trap. Just to give you a taste: for me to use it against you, I couldn't know that I caused it. But at the same time, there's no way for me to cause it without part of me knowing that I am.

There are multiple (conscious) layers of mind operating simultaneously and semi-independently. The left hand doesn't know what the right is doing. One is doing the dirty work while the other is kept clean.

**This** is the origin of plausible deniability. It doesn't start in governments or organizations, but right here in the individual psychology of *good people.* The "dark operative" doing dirty work while the "official part" maintains innocence? That architecture doesn't get imposed top-down. It blossoms from the bottom up; the natural, inevitable result of millions of us doing exactly this.

And then what do we feel when we locate the people up top "responsible for it all?"

*Contempt.*

But we'll get to that later.

## Hall of Mirrors

We left one important question unanswered: *how* did that part of me reveal itself to you, especially when it was hidden from myself?

Imagine (if you will) being on the receiving end of a dehumanizing gaze. Can you feel how the person is somehow turned away from themselves—or perhaps away from the "Light"?

**That** is what you are feeling when I treat you with contempt: my limbo state.

The act of turning away is invisible to me but visible to you—and not by accident. Both halves are crucial for the effect it induces. If I were fully aware of it, I couldn't do it. (Try giving someone a dehumanizing gaze in public yourself. Why is it so hard?) And if you weren't, then it would have no effect on you.

Contempt adds something on top of this basic pattern of malice: the pretense that I'm not doing it.

With pure malice, there's a (limbo) part of me that knows you're receiving it. With contempt, there's also the knowledge that you receive it as *hypocrisy.* But knowing that would defeat its purpose, so I'm forced to hide it—which you *also* see. So I'm forced to hide *that*...

Resulting in a kind of hall-of-mirrors effect. And paradoxically, this recursive structure of **hiding** is what accomplishes the **revealing** that the *other* part of me needed.

What you feel is something like "we both know what I'm really doing, and that it cannot be proven from the outside—so I'll never be forced to admit it to myself."

We've created what game theorists call "common knowledge": each party knows that the other knows that the other knows... *ad infinitum*. The reason such a bizarre thing is possible will become clear later.

Or, if you want to think of it more simply: my willingness to turn away from my Light licensed you to do the same. Embracing my darkness empowered you to embrace yours.

Or: when you saw me—a "good person"—ignoring my own conscience, you realized this world is even shittier than you thought, licensing you to ignore yours.

These are all equivalent formulations. In each case, part of me caused it—but since I "don't know" that, I take it as permission for me to do the same, resulting in a downward spiral we're all familiar with.

## Hijacking Goodness

Now I don't just accuse you of being a *bad person* for no reason at all. It's (usually) because I see *you* being out of integrity in some way. I see something dark in you, and I feel *compelled* to attack it. Morally obligated.

I'm not just accusing you of doing something wrong. It's as if I perceive that darkness as being *inherent to your very nature* somehow. And, having finally caught hold of the essence of *what's wrong with the world*, I'm not going to let it escape so easily.

In that moment, I cannot separate *it* from *you.* That perception of your inherent badness is somehow baked into my very perception. I don't just *think* it—I *see* it; *feel* it. If it didn't, I'd probably have a better chance of finding a way to correct you without making you worse.

And I suspect your friends and allies don't see you this way—which means that it's *my own mind* altering my perception of you.

Now, ask yourself: which part of me might have an incentive to make me see you in a way that causes me to behave this way? Might it be related to the part of me that lures me away from my conscience using justifications?

And after this interaction, won't I see you as even more surely defective?

And it accomplished all this through hijacking a genuinely good intention—to fight evil wherever I see it.

---

## A Self-Fulfilling Prophecy

This part of me—it *needs* me to see (some) people as inherently defective, because that's how it stays alive in me, and colonizes my mind more completely. That's a painful thing to confront.

But notice something astonishing about how it worked:

1. I have a deep, primal need to see other people as "what's wrong with the world."
2. This need is so dark I must hide it from myself, but so primal I can't help but reveal it to others.
3. That combination alone is enough to cause it.

It is a self-fulfilling prophecy. Its form **is** its function. Simply by existing, it spreads itself.

## Conclusion

Something in us *needs* our enemies to be the bad guys, and it finds ways to make them worse while carefully hiding our own role in it.

You might call this process "unconscious" or "subconscious," and there's something to that. Jung would say this material was repressed into the shadow, genuinely hidden from awareness. 

But when the medicine took me back to a time I'd done this, as much as I resisted seeing it—*and believe me, I resisted*—it was there in consciousness, clear as day. I had **always known it,** but hadn't let myself see it.

This isn't semantic hairsplitting. If it's unconscious, I can tell myself "I'll deal with that later"—it's buried somewhere I can't access right now. If it's limbo, it's conscious. And when I know something consciously and do it anyway, it is **intentional**—I'm just turning away from it. Which means I have a profound responsibility to stop doing that. Right now.

So there is a sense in which it wasn't the real me—and a sense in which it absolutely was. I'll unpack that paradox later, but for now: I'm responsible either way.

---

By exposing the deepest layers of my mind, the medicine taught me this: I couldn't run from my lies forever. And the very idea that I could was the deepest lie of all.

But more importantly, it showed me *how much better* it feels when I don't have to. And how, the closer I get to my Light, I more I see that I never *wanted* to.

That's what I rob from you when I treat you with contempt: I'm nudging you a little further from the part of you that doesn't *want* to carry the burden of ignoring your Light.
