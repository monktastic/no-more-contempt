# Part I: Contempt
## Conscience

Have you ever done something you knew was wrong at the time, but couldn't fully admit it to yourself until later? Maybe you made a cruel comment to boost your ego, took credit for someone else's work, or cheated on a test (or even partner).

While you were doing it, wasn't one part of you—your conscience—telling you it was wrong, while another was busy producing justifications for why it wasn't *really* wrong?

Notice an asymmetry here: your conscience wasn't trying to justify itself. It just... *was*. The part providing justifications wasn't trying to convince *it*; it was trying to convince *you*—that your conscience was just one more voice among the noise.

But it isn't.

We *know* we can't win a direct confrontation with our conscience. All we can do is find better ways of ignoring it.

So you did—and yet some part of you sensed this wouldn't end well, didn't it?

## Limbo

You might have convinced yourself you didn't "really" know it was wrong, right up until you were able to admit it—at which point you saw that you *always had*.

Notice this: both halves—the undeniable wrongness and the conviction of rightness—were actually conscious **the entire time**. Not hidden in some unconscious realm waiting to emerge. Right there. You just kept your attention carefully turned away.

That knowledge existed in a kind of "limbo state": a bizarre schism of mind in which we know something—*consciously*—and yet are **sure** we don't... until we retroactively discover that we always did.

It's a profound form of self-deception, but we don't do it because we're "bad people." Ignoring our conscience is a kind of defense against a world we perceive as hostile, rightly or wrongly. In ourselves, it feels like an innocent flaw—forgivable, given all we've seen and faced. But when others do it? We see them as inherently bad.

## Contempt and Integrity

Think back to a moment you felt contemptuously judged by another person. No matter how "right" they may have been; even if you *knew* you had done wrong, something felt *off* about them, didn't it? You could tell they weren't coming from a good place. How?

Now think of a time when someone set you straight with profound integrity—seemingly getting nothing out of it themselves. Even if it stung your ego; made you lose face, you had no desire to take revenge, did you? Why not? What could you tell they were serving?

Now turn it around.

Think of a time when *you* contemptuously judged someone. Even if you tried to hide your contempt, they still dug in their heels, didn't they? And somewhere inside, that resistance confirmed what you already believed.

And finally, a time when you corrected someone with integrity yourself. Perhaps you had to do it with more ferocity; more violence than in the previous case—and yet something in you knew it would ultimately bring *more* peace. *How* did you know?

---

That time you stood in integrity, and the time the person who corrected you did: even if you knew nothing else about them—their politics, their religion, their creed—didn't it feel like you were somehow serving the same thing? What is that?

And the time you stood in contempt, and were treated with contempt: didn't it feel like *those* were somehow serving the same thing? Not just your personal egos, either.

Integrity feels clean from both the inside and outside.

Contempt feels righteous inside but dark, dirty, insincere from the outside.

There's a reason for that distinction—and seeing it clearly changed everything for me.

## How Contempt Works

Here's what I saw.

When I mock or shame my enemies and they dig in, my response is mixed. On one level, I feel dismayed: *damn, they really are as bad as I feared*. But on another, I feel a certain satisfaction: *see, they really are as bad as I feared!*

Did I go into it expecting this satisfaction? Of course not—that would make me a bad person!

And yet, when you're on the receiving end, you somehow feel it, don't you? That I want to prove how bad you are, even while I claim I'm only trying to help?

*Of course* there was a part of me that wanted this outcome, even as I did it—I just couldn’t admit it to myself. I'd like to call it "unconscious," but that's not quite right. It was just in limbo.

And lo and behold: it worked: my *hidden intention* for you to dig in was enough to bring it about. 

But how? Really pause and reflect on this. How did you perceive something in me that I barely knew myself—unless *part of me was somehow showing it to you?*

Now, I want to be clear about this: it's not that I *consciously* wanted you to see it in the usual sense of that word. Except here's the thing: the medicine showed me exactly where this knowledge had been lurking in my conscious mind the whole time. My desire for you to see it **was** conscious—it was just more deeply hidden than my mere hope that you'd dig in.

And it gets worse.

Anyone who's been on the receiving end of contempt knows that this will be the result—that it makes us feel worse. So we also know it on the delivering end—it's just more deeply hidden. Part of me (consciously) knew in advance it was going to work, and I did it anyway. Doesn't that sound like an *intention*?

Moreover, don't I already know there's a way to correct people that *doesn't* cause this to happen?

So what did my contempt *add*, exactly?

Your digging in wasn't accidental, and it wasn't just an unfortunate side-effect of my good intentions: **it was secretly the whole point.** I was just telling myself pretty stories about how good it would be—and buying them so completely that they became "true" for me.

Which meant that when you did dig in, I could use it against you. Because not only did you fight back against my righteous behavior—which only an evil person would do—you were implicitly accusing *me* of being the evil one. How *dare* you. This world is even worse than I thought—licensing me to ignore my conscience a little more. To fight for good, of course.

And in case you didn't see this coming: *part of me knew that, too. The whole thing was a fiendish ruse that would allow me to feel less guilty about disobeying my own conscience. That was the big payoff.*

Let that sit for a moment.

*Something in me revealed itself to you to license more darkness in me.*

And, to cinch the trap: part of me knows this, too—and it's so dark that I must **never** allow it into conscious awareness.

That's why we have no idea we're doing this.

---
## Plausible Deniability

It's difficult to unfold all the layers of this trap. Just to give you a taste: for me to hold it against you, I couldn't know that I caused it. But at the same time, there's no way for me to cause it without part of me knowing that I am.

There are two parallel (conscious) layers of mind operating simultaneously and semi-independently. The left hand doesn't know what the right is doing. One does the dirty work while the other is kept clean.

This is the origin of plausible deniability. It doesn't start in governments or organizations, but right here in the individual psychology of *good people.* The "dark operative" doing dirty work while the "official part" maintains innocence? That architecture doesn't get imposed top-down. It blossoms from the bottom up; the natural, inevitable result of millions of us doing exactly this.

And then what do we feel when we locate the people up top "responsible for it all?"

*Contempt.*

But we'll get to that later.

## Hall of Mirrors

We left one important question unanswered: _how_ did that part of me reveal itself to you—especially given that it was hidden from myself?

Imagine (if you will) being on the receiving end of a dehumanizing gaze. Can you feel how the person is somehow turned away from themselves—or perhaps away from the "Light"?

As we'll see later, it's impossible for me to do this without hiding something from myself—basically, your humanity. So I **cannot** wish harm or act selfishly without entering limbo—and that's what you see. 

**My limbo state is generally visible to you**—if only subconsciously. Notice how peculiar this is: hiding it from myself **is** what reveals it to you.

Now, malice alone may send a shudder down your spine, but it probably doesn't make you dig in. For that, an extra ingredient is necessary: the pretense of good. That pair is what contempt *is*.

This combination—malice with the pretense of good—is something we both instinctively recognize. Moreover, we both know that the *other* knows it, and that they know *that*, etc. It is thus what game theorists call *common knowledge.* (The reason for this will become clear later.)

Now, watch how that allows this game to unfold.

I'm hiding my malice while pretending it's good. But part of me knows you (correctly) recognize the pair as hypocrisy, which I must also hide from myself. But you now (correctly) recognize it as a ruse, which I must hide. So you now see it as a plausibly deniable ruse, which I must hide...

And the whole thing results in a kind of hall-of-mirrors effect. You feel it as a maddening sense of "we both know what I'm really doing, and that it cannot be proven from the outside—so I'll never be forced to admit it, even to myself." And **that** is what ultimately ensures you dig in.

It is the whole recursive structure of **hiding** of my true intention that **reveals** it[0].

You can also choose to look at it more simply: my willingness to turn away from my Light is what licenses you to do the same. Embracing my darkness empowers you to embrace yours.

Put another way: when you see me—a "good person"—ignoring my own conscience, you realize this world is even shittier than you thought, licensing you to ignore yours.

These are all equivalent formulations. In each case, part of me wanted you to see it—but since I "don't know" that, I see *you* as the bad one, giving me permission to do it more. It results in a downward spiral we're all familiar with.

## Hijacking Goodness

Now I don't just accuse you of being a *bad person* for no reason at all. It's (usually) because I see *you* being out of integrity in some way. I see something dark in you, and I feel compelled to attack it. Morally obligated.

I'm not just accusing you of doing something wrong. It's as if I perceive that darkness as being *inherent to your very nature*. And, having finally caught hold of this essence of *what's wrong with the world*, I'm not going to let it get away. I must punish it.

But in that moment, I cannot separate *it* from *you.* The sense of your inherent badness is somehow baked into my very perception of you. I don't just *think* you're bad—I *see* it; *feel* it. 

Now, I suspect your friends and allies don't see you this way—which means that it's *my own mind* altering my perception of you.

If it didn't—if I recognized you as a confused human like me—I might be able to understand you better and find a healthier (and more effective) way to stop or correct you.

Now, ask yourself: which part of me has an incentive to prevent me from seeing you like that? From giving in to my darkness? Might it be related to the part that lures me away from my conscience with clever rationalizations?

Of course it's the same part. This part of me—it manipulates both my thoughts *and* perceptions to draw me away from my Light. That's what makes it so insidious.

And after this interaction, won't I see you as even more surely defective, and vice versa? It now has a **tighter grip** on my mind—and yet I'm left feeling even *more* righteous; more confident than before. That sounds like a slippery slope.

Notice how it accomplished all this through hijacking a genuinely good trait: my desire to fight evil. And now I've given it more power over me, which means it can lead me even further from my Light next time.

---
## Thinking Your Way to Good

Similarly, when contemptuously judging bad people, it doesn't just *feel* righteous: you could probably prove that it *is.* (In fact, if this is your first time encountering this whole thing, you might have to re-read the earlier sections to remind yourself that *part of you already knows that it's not.*)

The problem isn't just that first initial thought / perception that lured you away from your Light. Once you're separated from it, your *whole cognitive apparatus* is unknowingly hijacked in service of your dark side—which means that you can't simply think your way out of it, no matter how careful you think you're being.

Have you ever tried to talk someone out of being evil? How well did that work?

And it's not a binary thing: separation from our Light happens along a continuum. Which means you might be in some version of it right now.

In fact, here's a simple test: is it possible for you to feel even a trace malice, contempt, or self-righteousness toward anybody for any reason? If so, your perception is being manipulated without your knowledge.

In fact, even if you were somehow free of those dark sentiments, there are still traces of it woven into your perception of reality itself. It's the reason humanity is so cavalier about ravaging nature. But we'll get to that later.

Remember: you already know how to stop bad behavior without contempt. You recalled doing so earlier. And whether fierce integrity is **always** sufficient or darkness is sometimes necessary: that's hard to answer right now—but notice there's a part of you that *needs* the latter to be true.

## Responsibility

You might call this process "unconscious" or "subconscious," and there's something to that. Jung would say this material was repressed into the shadow, genuinely hidden from awareness. 

But when the medicine took me back to a time I'd done this, as much as I resisted seeing it—*and believe me, I resisted*—it was there in consciousness, clear as day. I had **always known it,** but hadn't let myself see it.

This isn't semantic hairsplitting. If it's unconscious, I can tell myself "I'll deal with that later"—it's buried somewhere I can't access right now. If it's limbo, it's conscious. And when I know something consciously and do it anyway, it is **intentional**—I'm just turning away from it. Which means I have a profound responsibility to stop doing that. Right now.

So there is a sense in which it wasn't the real me—and a sense in which it absolutely was. I'll unpack that paradox later, but for now: I'm responsible either way.

---
## Summary

There's something in us that needs us to see our enemies as fundamentally defective, so that it can lure us into treating them in ways that make both of us worse.

This knowledge isn't unconscious; we've just buried it so deeply that it *feels* like we don't know it. And it needs us to feel that way, because otherwise we would feel the urgency of putting an end to it.

---
## Conclusion

By exposing the deepest layers of my mind, the medicine taught me this: I couldn't run from my lies forever. And the very idea that I could was the deepest lie of all.

But more importantly, it showed me *how much better* it feels when I don't have to. And how, the closer I get to my Light, I more I see that I never *wanted* to.

That's what I rob from you when I treat you with contempt: I'm nudging you a little further from the part of you that doesn't *want* to carry the burden of ignoring your Light.

---
## Interlude

Have you ever treated someone unkindly—perhaps mocking, shaming, or contemptuously judging them—only to discover later that you'd been unfair? That there was something about their story that rendered their behavior more understandable—even if not excusable—and how, if you'd known it at the time, you couldn't have been cruel?

Your perception of them shifted, right? Nothing changed about their outward appearance, and yet you *saw* something you hadn't before. A part of them that just wanted to be free of the pain.

And when you see that, you *can't help* but want to serve it. Not because you're especially noble, or because you calculated it would be "good," but because... it's just... obvious.

The person who corrected you with integrity: they were serving your Light; the *real you*—and they did that by refusing to accept your internal narrative about who you were in that moment; the *false* you. It's like they were reminding you of something you'd temporarily forgotten about yourself—but how?

And they weren't just serving you; they were serving something larger. How did they know these two would go hand in hand—that helping you *would* help the Whole? After all, you may have had different religions, politics, etc. 

And which *part* of them was serving you? In exactly the same way you can't win against your own conscience, didn't it feel like you couldn't win against that part? More importantly: did you even want to?

If they had chosen to treat you with contempt instead: which part of you would that have served? And would that have served the world?

Can you feel how the closer you get to your Light, the easier it is to see in others? It doesn't make you want to fight evil *less*. If anything, it makes you *more* protective of others—but you feel less need to inject your own darkness into it.

Where does this process stop?

## Footnotes

[0] Notice how bizarre this is: I made you lose a bit of faith in humanity by showing you that even the so-called "good people" (me) are willing to harm you for their own gain. But what was the actual harm? It was... showing you that good people are willing to harm you for their own gain.
