# The Pattern: How Evil Hijacks Our Goodness

> _For so long as the root of wickedness is hidden, it is strong. But when it is recognized, it is dissolved. When it is revealed, it perishes. ... It is powerful because we have not recognized it._ — The Gospel of Philip

# Prelude

The world is tearing itself apart.

Political division in the US is at historic highs. Authoritarian movements are rising globally. Trust in institutions is collapsing. And beneath it all, civilizational crises—climate, AI, nuclear proliferation—that would be nearly impossible to solve even if we _were_ working together.

We all know the obvious culprits: governments and corporations hiding dark agendas behind plausible deniability and sophisticated manipulation. The corruption is real. The evil is real.

But here's what keeps me up at night: **they know exactly what they're doing. And simultaneously—in a way that seems impossible—they don't.**

Before you close this thinking I'm making excuses for evil, let me be clear: we **must** stop them. But what I discovered is that our normal way of fighting them—with contempt, with righteous anger, with the certainty that we're fundamentally different from them—isn't just failing.

**It's making things worse.**

That same manipulativeness—the scheming, the bad faith, the willful blindness—exists in me too. And every time I engage in it, I strengthen theirs.

Carl Jung called this the _shadow_—that part of ourselves we'd rather not face. He spoke of how our individual shadows contribute to a collective darkness that makes atrocities possible.

So what makes this new? Here's the first thing I saw with devastating clarity:

**It's not accidental.**

Part of me has always _known_ that my choices to be out of integrity have lent strength to the very evils I claim to oppose. Not because I'm a bad person. I'm not, and neither are you. But because **this part of me benefits when the world gets darker.** When trust breaks down. When contempt spreads. When everyone becomes a little more like the "bad people" we're fighting.

And then the other shoe dropped:

**It's not truly unconscious.**

I can't blame it on an unconscious part of myself. It has always been accessible to my conscious mind. I had just chosen not to look. *We're all making that choice, to one degree or another.*

Here's what makes it so insanely difficult to see: **it hides this from me in the cleverest possible ways.** It convinces me I'm fighting evil, that I'm one of the good ones, that my contempt is justified and righteous and _working_. All while it's doing the opposite.

**This is why everything we're trying isn't working.** Not because we're not fighting hard enough. Not because the other side is too powerful. But because something operating through us is doing the darkness's work while we think we're fighting it.

**Fair warning:** 

The insight arrived on a "heroic dose" of psilocybin two decades ago, and has been slowly congealing ever since. Given that, why should you trust it?

You shouldn't. Blindly trusting me would be worse than useless. But you *can* look and discover it for yourself, if you're willing. Why would you want to?

**Because understanding this mechanism is the only way to actually stop it.**

Every major wisdom tradition has pointed at it: something that hijacks human consciousness while tricking us into believing it hasn't—at least, not in _us._ It's moving through all of us, using our attempts to fight it as fuel. 

I'd always considered it a metaphor, until I saw how concrete it really was. And once you see how it works, you can't unsee it.

I want to share my own way of pointing it out—one that might work better for modern people.

**What to expect:**

This is for you if you're willing to look at your own darkness without collapsing into shame. If you sense that spiritual traditions are pointing at something real—even if you can't stand the bypassing and platitudes. If you're aching for someone to finally name what you've already sensed but couldn't quite articulate.

I'm going to use language like "Light" and "darkness." Not as metaphors, but as the most precise terms I have for what's actually happening. If that language bothers you, feel free to translate it. But I'm going to ask you to hold something as a working hypothesis:

What if, at your core, you are Light itself? And what if everyone else is too—even the people doing terrible things?

If that feels impossible or naive right now, that's okay. Just stay curious about _why_ it feels impossible. There's something important in that resistance. We'll get there.

---

I'm probably wrong about parts of it, definitely still caught in it myself, and this is going to sound grandiose, but—I think the stakes are high enough that I need to try anyway.

You'll see the pattern operating in how I write this—the subtle positioning, the satisfaction of "figuring something out," the tone that sometimes slips into teaching-mode. I can feel it happening as I type. I haven't transcended this, and I'm not going to wait until I do—because that waiting feels like another form of it.

# Part 0

> _The earth is not dying, it is being killed, and those who are killing it have names and addresses._ —Utah Phillips

Can you feel it—the _evil people_ out there, ruining it for the rest of us?

How do they make you feel? How do you want _them_ to feel? Be totally honest.

Would some tiny part of you be disappointed to discover they're not _fundamentally_ evil—that they're just badly confused but inherently redeemable people like the rest of us? Would that part feel robbed of the right to deliver the righteous vengeance they so richly deserve?

Here's a test: if you had to choose between delivering that vengeance and offering them a pill that would instantly enlighten them—which would you choose? Forget about the "right" answer. Is there a tiny flicker in there that's itching to mash that first button?

What is that part of you trying to accomplish?

What is it _actually_ accomplishing?

That part of you, and that part of me—they're _working together._

I don't know you. My politics may be diametrically opposite yours.

And yet it doesn't matter. They're still working together.
