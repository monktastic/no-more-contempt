# Chapter III: The Parasite

## Shielding

Thinking back to the Part 1 Interlude: do you remember how much more natural it feels to want to be of service to people than to harm them?

The desire to harm—including contempt—requires that you shield yourself from their humanity. It's not your natural condition. It's something your dark side **adds** to your perception.

Can you imagine what it would be like if that shielding knob were turned up to its maximum?

You'd know what it's like to be evil.

Evil people don't do a different thing than the rest of us—theirs is just more extreme. They've been turned away from their Light so long that the very idea of such a thing feels insane.

But there's more.

## Parasite

Have you ever been so angry you didn't care what it destroyed—as long as it made them _feel it_? In that moment, it felt like you. It felt like you were seeing more clearly than you ever had, right? And yet in retrospect, doesn't it feel like "_whoa, that wasn't me?_" It feels almost like _possession._

When we turn away from our Light, we're turned away from ourselves—but _something_ is still in control. And that "something" drives us to create a world we don't actually want—one in which people are more selfish, our enemies are dug in, etc.

This thing **needs** to stay hidden from me—for me to be in limbo—to survive.

It doesn't _feel_ like me, until it takes over me—at which point it does, and pursues goals that benefit _it_ but not the real me. What does that sound like?

It's a **parasite**.

I have one, you have one. And when mine attacks you, it strengthens yours.

Our parasites aren't fighting—they're collaborating. Tricking us into _thinking_ we're fighting as a way to gain more control over all of us.

And it's working.

The more often it takes control, the further our baseline state gets from the Light, and the less we remember that such a thing ever existed—and that it's the real us. The less power we have to rescue other people from theirs.

The more this happens, the more it takes over our whole identity—until one day it simply _is_ us.

This is where the "evil people" are trapped. And as long as I'm not free of my parasite, I will feel the compulsion to keep them trapped there. And anyone who questioned this would be naive, stupid or... evil.

Before we go further, I need to address something: what do I mean by _parasite_?

## On the Metaphysics

I'm not claiming it's a _literal_ parasite—at least, not in the sense most of us are used to. But I'm also not saying it's just a metaphor. There's something experientially precise here to discover, that I've found makes more sense of collective human behavior than other frameworks I've encountered. But I have no way of making it metaphysically precise.

I also don't think that's an accident. This thing survives by hiding in our blind spots—and trying to pin things down **always** creates blind spots. Let me give you some examples.

### Is it me?

If so, I'll become defensive when it's pointed out ("I'm not someone who would knowingly darken the world!"). I'll feel shame when I realize what I've done, preventing me from getting a closer look at it.

If not, then I'll absolve myself of responsibility for all the harm I've caused while under its sway.

### Is it you?

If so, why would I bother to look for any good in you? Harming you _is_ harming it.

If not, I'll fail to act with the fierce resolve needed to actually stop you.

### Is it "real"?

If so, then (especially as I discover more of its bizarre cooperative behavior) I'll fall into age-old patterns. It's the Devil, and I'm God's (self-)righteous warrior. My team must win at any cost.

If not, then it's just psychology. I'll outsource the problem to science, never realizing that such abdication IS the problem.

Notice how every one of these lets it sneak in the back door. In fact—and this might be the deepest insight in this whole essay—the very origin of the parasite _is_ our desperate need to pin down reality—something impossible for any finite mind to do. But more on that later.

What I've found most useful is to bracket the whole issue and engage experientially. That said, the cleanest working model I have is: it **is** me, but not the **real** me.

For the rest of the book, I will switch between calling it your parasite / darkness / devil—or sometimes just "you." Context should make it clear what I mean.
