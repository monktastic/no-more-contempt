My willingness to turn away from myself is giving you license to do the same, and part of me knows this. It's like 


Until you see how contempt is secretly designed to darken other people's minds—and how you hide this knowledge from yourself to enable it—you will never understand how *other* people can do wrong. You will always make the mistake of using contempt to fix it, which will only worsen it.



[Its key trick is to make us believe we're fighting each other—or to misunderstand what it means to fight each other. Conflict will always be inevitable. But it doesn't have to be a vehicle for supporting our primal nemesis.]

I'll briefly describe what I see as the solution—but I'm not enlightened, so I'm sure I've got some of it wrong.

The truth is, I can never actually know whether another person is irredeemable. But I can certainly *convince* myself they are, so that I don't notice anything "off" when I'm busy shoving their mind deeper into the abyss.

[until one day it IS me]

[Maybe you can calculate... but what about the assumptions that go into it? Those assumptions are themselves infected.]

---
---

It feels like it's helping *somehow*. I'm rubbing their noses in how *bad* they are. Maybe that will help them finally get it and change their ways! And if they don't, well, that just proves me right!

Okay fine, I'm flashing them my own darkness—but that's only to show them what I'm really capable of! To frighten them into stopping. *My* darkness isn't real darkness; it's just strategic—the kind all "good people" must harbor to fight *real* evil.

I'm literally harming someone by telling myself stories of how righteous it is. That delicious hit of self-righteousness? It's just my thirty pieces of silver.

---

Forget about the metaphysics for a moment—whether this is a "real thing" with its own agenda. Is it not an eerily precise description of an impossibly dark and fiendishly clever pattern?

When I see "evil" in you—might I not be looking at exactly this same thing in *your* mind?

Obviously the details of yours differ. The justifications it uses on you are custom-tailored to your psyche, and the way you act it out may be different. But isn't the result the same—a world more fit for this thing to survive, and *less* fit for humanity?

That person who corrected you with fierce integrity: didn't it feel like they were reminding you of something in yourself that you had temporarily forgotten? A sense of: *this isn't you?*

And the same way you can't argue with your own conscience—didn't it feel like you couldn't really argue with them? That any justifications would fall flat? Almost like they were an external manifestation of something in you—something deeper than your parasite.

So there *is* something that fights the darkness—and it can do so fiercely; even violently. 

The crucial distinction is: it never mistakes the person for their parasite. And this one "little" change makes *all* the difference in the world.

## The Hitler Objection

Maybe you're thinking "fine, maybe this works for most people—but some people really *are* fundamentally irredeemable."

But the truth is, you can't ever really know, can you—whether there's some tiny spark still in there?

And yet there is one thing you can know, through direct experience: any time you view someone that way, you *will* find darkness at the helm. You may not recognize it at the time, but look.

The *only* reason I ever believe this about someone is that some part of me knows I can sneak something dirty in. Usually there's some agenda of my own that I secretly suspect is self-serving, and "proving" this person irredeemable suddenly renders it justified.

Was Hitler "irredeemable" in the sense that there's absolutely no reason for me to waste my time trying to "redeem" him? Yeah, I'd definitely shoot him.

But there's a kind of... ontological, fundamental, inherent, etc. irredeemability that's different from the functional kind. And when I see people that way—even if I don't realize I am—that's contempt.

And if I shoot Hitler with contempt—with *bloodlust*—it feels different to you, doesn't it?

In one case, I'm serving justice in the only way I know how, and not taking violent pleasure in it. In the other, I'm feeding *your* bloodlust.

You may *think* that bloodlust can somehow stay contained to Hitler, or to Nazis, or maybe just to your political enemies... who are basically Nazis, anyway...

---

It's incredible how subtle contempt can be and still accomplish its job.

For example, nobody has probably ever thought of their partner as "ontologically morally defective"—and yet, during an argument, it's common to feel a twinge of "what's wrong with you?" That's contempt—and it's the leading predictor of divorce, for good reason.

When I skirt my conscience—say, shaving off a little extra for myself somewhere—I'm showing a kind of contempt for humanity; putting myself above others. And in a culture where that's normalized, doesn't it invite people to disobey their consciences more generally?

---
---

## The Score

The reason I need to "turn away" to treat you with contempt is that part of me knows exactly what I'm doing to you—that I'm darkening your world; making you lose a bit of faith in humanity. But it gets worse.

The only reason it has this effect on you is that you're ultimately just like I am—and I *know* this. You're lost and confused. That's the human condition, isn't it? And I'm shoving you deeper *into* that horrible abyss. Of *course* I'd have to hide that from myself.

And this isn't the first time I've done something like this. I *know* this darkness lives in me—and that's genuinely horrifying. In fact, it's so awful that I have no option but to bury it so deeply that even *I* don't know about it.

But that doesn't make it go away. Far from it. It makes me act out in ways that actually *increase* the darkness "out there"—because a darker world provides cover for my own. That way, I can focus all my energy on attacking the darkness in others—which just happens to be the primary way mine spreads itself.

But it's the *mechanism* by which it does this that's truly astonishing.

When I turn away from my "better nature," it is *automatically* visible to you and yet hidden from me. I don't have to do anything extra for these to happen. In that state, it's almost as if my darkness is *resonating* with yours. You feel yourself drawn into that same condition.

And this doesn't just happen if you're my enemy. If you're an ally and we're bonding over shared contempt for our enemy, I'm drawing you into it, too. Can you feel that?

Isn't it a little strange that such a transmission mechanism exists? That simply by *entering* my "dark state"—something I'm not even aware of doing—it somehow spreads itself?

And it doesn't even require direct interaction. When I skirt my conscience in other ways—say I shave off a little extra for myself somewhere—I'm treating humanity with a kind of contempt. And in an atmosphere where that's normalized, aren't you more willing to skirt your own conscience in general?

The thing is, I don't actually *want* a darker world. If I could clearly see the tradeoff I was making, I couldn't make it. 


See, I don't actually *want* a darker world. Not when I stop and think about it. So even if it feels like I'm "getting away with something" every time I skirt my conscience, I'm actually acting against my own best interests.

It's more like this part of me—us?—is making me *believe* it's worth it, by shielding me from the full implications of my behavior. I mean, even the elites don't want the pitchforks to come out, or the biosphere to collapse, right?

So who's ultimately benefiting from all these little "deals with the Devil"?

The darkness itself.



Actually, "viciously" is too strong. Sometimes I sneak just a *tiny* bit of contempt into an otherwise-innocuous joke or comment—so that I know I'm not one of those *bad* people. If it just happens to darken the minds around me, well, that says something about them, not me.






These are all forms of "turning away from myself."

When other people do this—say, when they shave off a little extra for themselves because "what's the big deal"—don't I feel more licensed to do the same?

So don't I already suspect that my doing it licenses the same in them?

Maybe I begin to notice: hmm, being selfish requires the same fundamental gesture—*turning away*—as contempt. And that move—dehumanization—is also at the root of the world's worst atrocities.

They're not at all the same in terms of scale or impact, of course. But they all have something fundamental in common, and they all seem to feed each other.

So if I now suspect that my minor indiscretions may somehow be connected—however tenuously—to the great horrors of the world... might that not make me a tiny bit uncomfortable?

I *need* to know there's no connection there. That the monsters who commit genocides aren't just lost in a deeper form of the same self-deception I am. Because what would that say about me?

It would mean that I wasn't merely misguided in thinking that hatred would help—I've actually been *reinforcing* the problem.


—in which case my own misbehavior may be supporting the conditions that enable them. I must know that they're *inherently* evil. 

Their darkness must be of a *fundamentally different nature* than mine, or else I am complicit. And I cannot. Fucking. Be. Complicit in *genocides*.

So what do I do? I hold the firm, righteous intention to see them as irredeemably evil. That way, I never question whether the behavior that results from this decision might be creating exactly the outcome I so desperately need to uphold my worldview.

---

To be honest, sometimes I *know* I'm flashing you my darkness, but I tell myself that it will somehow help. 

I'm just showing you what I'm really capable of, so that you'll stop. Or maybe it will provoke your darkness—but I'm not *creating* it; I'm just revealing what was already there. Okay fine, maybe I *am* creating it—but I couldn't do that unless you already wanted it. So again, you're the bad one.

Any way you slice it, it's a genuine service to the world.

The justifications are literally endless.

---
## The Light

If we're calling turning away from my better nature "darkness," maybe we can tentatively call my better nature my "Light."

I know this can evoke religious or spiritual connotations, but I find it accurate to the experience. Because as long as the entirety of my field of awareness is illuminated—there's nothing hidden from myself—I find it difficult to cause harm or be selfish.

And when others seem to be in full integrity, we seem to be oriented in the "same direction." Again, it's not that the particulars are the same—we might still have different goals or ways of achieving them—but we're somehow both attuned toward... goodness? Something I can't quite pin down and yet know clearly.

Conflict still inevitably arises, but it's not bitter in the same way, and that makes things easier.

So sometimes I may call it "the" Light instead of "my" Light. We'll explore reasons why such alignment may exist later.

---
## The Medicine Reveal

The medicine took me back to a time when I'd "righteously" shamed my enemy. 

The knowledge of what I was doing had always been right there, hiding in plain sight. I'd just been looking away. But in this replay, the option to hide it or turn away had somehow been removed.

In this state, I saw that I had *always* known they were painfully lost and confused, just as I was—not inherently evil.

I saw clearly how my own decision to "turn away"—one enabled by my own confusion—just compounded theirs. I was chipping away at their faith in humanity; giving them a reason to be cynical. The dark message being conveyed felt like:

>*See? Even the so-called "good people" are ultimately frauds, willing to abandon the Light when it suits them. We both know where the **real** power lies in this world. So why fight it?*

*Shudder.*

**That's** what my conscience had been warning me about. It wasn't being naive. It wasn't telling me to be *nice.* It was warning me not to fall for my own devastating lies.

I created the exact thing I thought I was fighting. By ignoring the one thing that could have stopped me.

---

It's not that contempt accidentally makes things worse. It's that it *exists* to create the thing it condemns—because then the self-elevating retroactively justifies itself. And as we'll see, most of humanity (myself included) lives in a state of perpetual low-grade contempt.

Any time I skirt my conscience—telling a cruel joke and pretending it's “just honesty” or a white lie to “protect them”; skimming a little extra because “I deserve it”; cutting corners when I know no one will notice—I’m in a mild state of contempt. I'm elevating myself above others so that I feel entitled to more.

When I express casual cruelty—"Darwin awards!" when a stranger dies in an easily-preventable way; "fuck around and find out"; "play stupid games, win stupid prizes"; etc—I'm savoring the suffering of others while pretending it's just neutral observation. Inviting you to savor it with me. "*What? Is what I said technically wrong? Stop being such a killjoy.*"

It doesn't even require taking action. Just walking around feeling a subtle sense of *inherent superiority*—morally, intellectually, whatever—I'm subtly darkening the minds around me. Or if I carry around a sense of wanting to take others down a notch; put them in their place; teach them a lesson; etc.

All of it is meant to slightly degrade the world—because the degraded world, in turn, protects that same dark part of me. The more frayed the moral fabric becomes, the easier it is for my own small betrayals to disappear into the noise.

---

So turning away from "myself"; my "better nature"; my "Light"—all seem to be pointing at the same thing. It's like my "better nature" feels closer to what I *am*.

My darkness, by contrast, feels foreign.

---
## The Parasite

I don't want more entrenched enemies. Plus, will they be more or less likely to treat others with kindness? That toxicity ripples, and I don't want a darker world.

When I skirt my conscience, sure, maybe I get a little more for myself—but is it worth the degraded social fabric? In the moment it may feel like it, but not when I have time to reflect.

So this "thing"—it doesn't share my deepest values.

When I'm fully aware of its operation—when I can't hide it from myself—can it still do its job? No. It can *only* operate in my blind spots; by hiding itself from me.

And while it is operating, what does it feel like?

Well, have you ever been so angry you didn't care what it destroyed—as long as it made them feel it?

While you were in that state, it felt like you were finally seeing clearly; cutting through all the noise, etc., right? But afterward, didn't it feel like "whoa, that wasn't me?" It's almost like you were *possessed*.

So here we have something that I don't want and that doesn't feel like me. But sometimes it lures me away from myself, which creates a gap, in which it takes control. Yet I still feel like me. From inside that state, I somehow can't tell that I'm turned away.

It then works toward a world that doesn't truly benefit me, but clearly benefits *it*—a world which both my enemy and I perceive as more threatening, so that we give it *more* control in the future.

What does that sound like to you?

It's a *parasite.*

After it gives back control, part of me knows what I've done—but it's too dark to face, so I bury that knowledge. I convince myself that no such thing happened—or that if it did, it was unconscious or accidental. That way, I never get a close look at the mechanism that enabled it.

It uses shame to hide itself.

---
---


## The Mechanism

If you were trying to design a quirk that would spread evil through humanity, it would be hard to do better than this, wouldn't it?

That's interesting: the very thing that makes my limbo state invisible to me makes it visible to you. Which means that even if I'm the one licensing you to misbehave, I won't realize it. In fact, I'll see *you* as the problem.

---


Let's recap.

There's something in me that lures me away from my conscience with clever justifications. It prevents me from noticing this, while simultaneously announcing it to others—thereby licensing them to abandon their own integrity, which reinforces the same mistake in me.

Each turn of this wheel makes me less likely to notice what's happening. The world just looks darker, and so I'm forced to fight dirtier. I'm not *ignoring* my conscience, I'm just gently... correcting it to keep up with the reality of the situation. After all, it can be a bit naive sometimes.

I don't just *think* my enemies are bad—I can practically *see* it; *feel* it. And after each interaction, it becomes more palpable; harder to talk me out of.

It's almost like this thing is driving us toward Armageddon—and manipulating my perception so that the whole thing feels natural; justified; *righteous*.

If it just came out and announced itself as a dark force creating Hell on Earth, we wouldn't exactly agree, would we? It would *have* to hide itself so perfectly that we'd never suspect we were being manipulated.

In fact, even speaking about it in these terms—as though it were an entity with its own agenda and intelligence—would set off alarm bells. We'd dismiss it as "woo" and return to quietly serving it.

---

If you don't like the entity framing yet, that's fine. For now let's explore the phenomenology and effects.

When I feel contempt, I'm perceiving you as *fundamentally morally defective*; subhuman.

Without any other context, I would feel that dehumanizing you is deeply wrong. The only reason I don't is that I've convinced myself it's somehow righteous in this particular case.

Sound familiar? The part that knows it's wrong—it's not trying to justify itself. And the justifications don't really convince it—they just convince me not to notice it.

Of *course* I'm disobeying my conscience. I already know there's a way to stop you that doesn't provoke your dark side, and I'm choosing one that obviously will.

The reason I don't notice that is something like this: I know in the abstract that disobeying my conscience is "wrong," and I've convinced myself that what I'm doing is "right." Therefore, by definition, I cannot be ignoring it.

I'm playing word games to arrive at a foregone conclusion, and not being honest with my experience.


---


Have you ever been on the receiving end of a dehumanizing gaze? Malice practically emanates from that state, doesn't it? The person doesn't have to try to reveal it, it just naturally... leaks.

And what is contempt if not dehumanizing? I see you as fundamentally morally defective; subhuman. It's just covered with a veneer of righteousness. Of *course* you're going to feel that.

But in the moment, I'm not noticing that. I'm focused on all the ways my behavior will be a net good.

You feel that energetic mismatch—the dehumanization paired with the supposed righteousness—and you instinctively know what's going on. People feel clean when they're acting in accordance with their conscience. But I'm clearly rationalizing. Overriding my conscience.

And if I'm going to ignore mine, why should you follow yours? Fuck that.

---

I've just given license to your dark side.

But of course, I don't know that I've done this—or at least, I think I don't. Which means I can only read your reaction as recalcitrance. You're digging in your heels against pure goodness—which means you must be evil. You leave me no option but to escalate.

I won't discover my mismatch myself until later—at which point I'll realize, in retrospect, that part of me always knew. And if I knew it but didn't stop, that would make it intentional. It would mean I was provoking your dark side just to prove how evil you are. And that would be painful to admit.

So instead of owning it, I bury that knowledge even deeper.

---

Okay, but was it actually intentional? Let's see.

There's a part of me that finds **nothing** more satisfying than violently punishing evil, and I just nudged you one step closer to being the kind of person who can only be dealt with that way.

Okay, that screams "intention" but how would this part of me—call it my "dark part"—execute on such a plan?

All it would really have to do is reveal itself to my enemies while hiding itself from me.




Surely that's not a coincidence—especially because there's a way I could have stopped you that wouldn't have caused this, and I already know it.




That's way too precise to be accidental, isn't it?

The part of me with that dark urge—call it my darkness—doesn't it seem like exactly the kind of thing that would lure my away from my conscience? That would "conveniently" make me forget there was a better way in the moment?

And look at how it accomplished this. It hid itself from me while revealing itself to you. Both halves were necessary.


It couldn't just come out and announce itself as evil. For one, I'd put an end to it; and for another, it wouldn't give you that eerie "knowing but not knowing" quality that makes you dig in.

The limbo state isn't incidental; it's a functional requirement of this thing.

And after it has done its dirty deed, it grows stronger in me. Now that I see how "evil" my enemies really are, I'm more likely to ignore my naive conscience in the future.

[**Together** they create something new: "I was intentionally doing this (in limbo), and the thing doing it through me has agency that's separate from but operating through my conscious mind, which means I'm responsible for it while also being its victim."]

---

But if something like this existed, surely it would have garnered widespread attention by now.

Or would it?

Are humans really ready to give up all the places where we skirt our consciences?

Are we really ready to discover that our enemies aren't the inherently evil people we've thought?

Of course wisdom traditions have been pointing at this thing for millennia. I'd even studied some of it myself—but there were angles to it that I hadn't considered.[x]

---



Here's the story I tell myself about my enemies instead.

I'm done with their bullshit, and I'm going to make them show their true faces so everyone can see them for what they are. Sure, my method may be a bit underhanded, but sometimes that's what's required to fight evil.

I know I could listen to my naive conscience and take the "integrity" route, but what would be the point? They're evil, so they'll eventually reveal their darkness anyway. But it'll take longer, and by that time innocent people could get hurt. 

So I better speed things along. Flash them a bit of my dark side. You know, just to draw theirs out of hiding. What could be wrong with that?

It's not like I'm not *creating* their darkness—just revealing it! And anyway, the darkness I'm flashing them isn't *real* darkness. It's strategic—you know, the kind all good people must harbor to keep real evil in check.

---

It's always the same lie, and it always ends the same way.

---



---

In that state, verses from the Bible started coming to mind—and I'm not even Christian!

>*Judge not, lest ye be judged.* —Matthew 7:1

>*Let he who is without sin cast the first stone.* —John 8:7

The meaning was so obvious in retrospect. It wasn't meant to make us passive. Not to stop us from evaluating others' behavior, or from fiercely acting against them. It was about *contemptuous* judgement—the pretense that I'm made of *better stuff*.

And it wasn't out of some abstract religious principle—but because, if we really looked at what we were doing in that moment, we would discover ourselves *creating evil.*

Why wasn't this already obvious to me? Of *course* "don't judge" didn't mean "don't use wise discernment!" How could we ever accomplish genuine good without it?

And that's when I saw it. It's not that I'd misunderstood. I'd just conveniently *pretended* not to understand, so that I could dismiss it as naive. So that I could keep ignoring the warnings and then throw my hands up later and ask: "*how could I possibly have known?*!"

---






---

If I could see this part operating in me while it was happening, I'd be forced to put an end to it. That's why it requires me to be in limbo—a state where I'm slightly turned away.

But it's also not unconscious. That way, it's still "me," and so I feel profound shame once I realize what I've done.


---

Notice how it makes *both* parties worse. I see you as more evil, you see me the same way, and we both feel licensed to ignore our "naive" consciences more in the future.

And this isn't happening just once or twice, is it? It's a pattern we see endlessly repeated across humanity, pretty much constantly. Contempt is the #1 predictor of divorce. It's driving political parties in the US toward civil war. Genocides famously start with the perpetrators seeing their victims as "vermin" (Nazis), "cockroaches" (Tutsis), etc.


---


That's what contempt for my enemies is.



---




---

Here's the thing: I don't actually want a shittier world. At least, not when I have time to stop and reflect. So what's actually happening?


---

And it doesn't just manipulate my thoughts.

Consider: I don't just *think* my enemies are evil; I *see* it; *feel* it. And after I've reinforced their darkness, I see it even more clearly. They become easier to harm.

This thing is manipulating my perceptions—and not just while it's in control. My baseline state is shifted, making the world seem darker. It's not gone; it's just dormant, biding its time.

But even that's not quite correct. Have you ever met an especially self-righteous or aggressive person? Something in them is *scanning* for opportunities to strike. It's not passively waiting.

In the same way, something in me is *itching* for an excuse to "give it to" the bad guys.

Every time I hand it control, it colonizes my mind a little more fully. Each time, it feels more and more like "me." It becomes harder and harder to convince me that it's not—until one day, it simply *is.*

This is where the "evil people" are stuck—not in a fundamentally different state than the rest of us; just a far more complete version of the same one.

Their cognitive apparatus has been hijacked to such an extent that there's basically no way to talk them out of it—or for them to even notice that they're in it. Their Light has never stopped trying to warn them—they're just so far turned away that they basically no longer hear it.

Their parasite has taken over so completely that they think they *want* it—almost like a form of Stockholm Syndrome.

---

So my parasite hides itself perfectly from me while loudly displaying itself to others.


---



But it's not just them. Every one of us—except, perhaps, for the enlightened—lives in some version of this state. If you can feel even the slightest trace of malice, contempt, or self-righteousness toward *anybody*, 




---

In all the above examples, I'm disconnected from that authentic desire. That's what it means to turn away from my conscience—or from the Light. And I don't do it because I'm a _bad person_. Something in my mind has replaced my North Star with a simulacrum.

I'm telling myself *stories* about how I'm making things better—and I can't tell them apart from genuine integrity. But others can sense it.

That's the darkness you feel leaking out. It's most obvious in malice—when you (or your allies) are on the receiving end, anyway. But it's there even in my smaller betrayals.

The darkness always leaks.

Now that it's been pointed out, it's obvious in retrospect, isn't it?

And the truth is, we've *always* known. Not unconsciously. Just hidden in limbo.

---

What happened, in essence, was that by stepping away from my own Light, I licensed them to step away from theirs.

---








Here's what I saw.

When I mock or shame my enemies and they dig in, my response is mixed. On one hand, I feel dismayed: *damn, they really are as bad as I feared*. But on the other, there's a flicker of satisfaction: *see, they really are as bad as I feared!*

Did I go into it *expecting* to feel that satisfaction? Of course not—I'm not a bad person.

And yet, on the receiving end, you somehow feel it, don't you? That I want to prove how bad you are, even while I claim I'm only trying to help?

*Of course* I felt it while I was doing it. But it was a bit malicious, so I hid it from myself. It wasn't unconscious—**just in limbo**. That's why it feels like I didn't know.

Okay, so maybe I wanted this outcome—but it's not like I caused it. How would I even do that? "Hey you, dig in your heels so I can prove how evil you are!"

Of course not. But there is a simpler way...

---

Have you ever been on the receiving end of a dehumanizing gaze? Doesn't the person seem somehow turned away from themselves, or perhaps from the "Light"? A person doesn't have to *try* to convey malice. It simply... leaks.

Contempt works the same way. I see you as fundamentally less than me, subhuman—the only difference being I'm also dressing it up as righteous.




The part of me that wants

By keeping it hidden from myself, I automatically accomplish both halves: showing it to you while appearing ignorant of it.

---

The unconscious mind does not perpetrate ruses this precise. This was conscious. But it was so dark I could only do it from deeper limbo.

Here's the story I told myself to cover it up: fine, maybe I wanted you to see my darkness. But it was only to frighten you into stopping!

But I've already admitted that I _wanted_ you to dig in, and that I knew this would cause it. Plus, I *know* there's a way of fighting evil that doesn't cause this.

Of *course* making you dig in was the real reason I wielded contempt. It didn't accomplish anything else. My feeling of dismay at the outcome was just a decoy to let me believe I wasn't responsible.

---

I *cannot* see you as "less than" without letting it leak somehow. Part of me knows this, and I still do it—which means I don't care if you see it.

It's not that I *want* you to hurt, per se, but I also don't care if you do—nor do I care if you see this about me. And on top of that, I dress it up as "righteous"—which means I'm not planning to stop. I will block any attempts from you to reach my conscience, and you can see that.

This pattern is so common that you recognize it instantly. Which means you don't start by asking me nicely to stop, or attempt to reach my conscience. You go straight for the jugular—and end up proving exactly what I needed you to prove: you're acting in bad faith and must be stopped at any cost.

---

I'm not just making you dig in; I'm screwing with your whole sense of reality and morality. I'm showing you that even the so-called "good people" are willing to harm you for a "good cause." This chips away at your faith in humanity; darkens your world—but I'm fine with that, because the ends justify the means.

I'm giving you license to embrace your own darkness.

Why on Earth would I do that?

---



---

The more we see this thing in action, the more we'll discover a sense in which it has its own agenda—one that's against not only mine, but all of humanity's.

For now, you can think of it as an aspect of yourself. There's an important sense in which it isn't "you" (which we'll explore more later), but you're certainly responsible for the harm you've caused while under its sway.

I'll sometimes call it "it" (or the parasite), and sometimes you. The meaning should be clear from context.

---
## In Too Deep

Let's look at how it covers itself up.

Part of me knew what I was doing, even as I was doing it. The harm it caused you was real and profound. Which means that I know how a perfectly decent human—me—can commit great evil while flawlessly convinced he's helping.

Which means that maybe I'm wrong about you. Maybe you're not fundamentally evil after all. Maybe you're just caught in a different version of the same trap. 

That would be devastating—because it would mean that I'm shoving an inherently redeemable person deeper into the abyss; into that dark place where evil feels *necessary.*

When you dug in, I knew you became worse, but I convinced myself I was merely exposing the darkness already latent in your mind, for all the world to see. Now I see I actually created *new* evil—which you will certainly spread to others.

And the worst part is, whether or not we call it "intentional," I did this all *consciously*.

That's *way* too dark to face. I must bury it so deep that even *I* will never know what I've done.

---

If I could recognize it as a parasite in that moment—something I'm responsible for yet which isn't "me"—I would still feel *remorse.* But I'd be able to make amends while also committing to never doing it again.

Instead, I feel profound guilt and shame—making me much less likely to recognize what actually happened. This makes me *more* susceptible to it in the future.

Shame is one of its most powerful protective mechanisms. It may feel virtuous—like I'm being honest about my flaws—but it makes me a worse person. It also has the same effect on my enemies.

---

The part of me unaware that I've caused this—the part I normally think of as just "me"—look at how it feels.

The world is a darker place. Filled with horrible people. So I'll be less likely to notice the self-serving aspects of my actions and agendas.

Let's be honest: nearly every political agenda has pieces



This is what I mean by "hand more control to my parasite": it has an easier time luring me away from my conscience, while making me less likely to recognize that this is what's happening.

And it's not just my thoughts it's manipulating.

Even before this encounter, I didn't just _think_ you were evil—I could _see_ it in your eyes, _feel_ it emanating from you. And now that perception has just been strengthened.

It's not arguing with me about whether you're evil. It's making me _perceive_ you as evil, at a level below conscious awareness.

It's gaining increasing control over the very cognitive apparatus needed to detect its subterfuge.

That doesn't seem good.

---





---

Contempt isn't just "what you're doing is bad." It's "what you *are* is bad. Defective."

You're not fully human. That gives me the right to use you as a prop in my moral theater.

---

Doesn't the person seem somehow turned away from themselves, or perhaps from the "Light"?

That's what you're feeling with my contempt—just with the added veneer of righteousness.

I already know there's a way to fight evil that doesn't cause this. So what does the contempt add? Nothing, except the right to do this to you without compunction.

But it gets worse.

---

Isn't there some part of you that already knows this is how it works—even if you've never seen it laid it out so clearly?

We all instinctively recognize it. Which means you not only know what I'm doing; you know that *I* know it. We both know I'm pulling a ruse—one I'll never own up to, even to myself.

Here you are, witnessing a self-proclaimed "good person" gaslighting you to prove how good they are. This screws with your sense of reality and morality; chips away at your faith in humanity. Part of me *knows* this will happen—and I do it anyway.

The harm didn't just come from the simple act of mockery—it came from the *profound malice* implicit in the whole ruse. Although that harm results from the *entirety* of the ruse, that malice was present at the *start* of it.

In other words, I harmed you by showing you how much I was willing to harm you. It was a self-fulfilling prophecy.

And that's not all.

---

Whatever compunction you may have felt about the dark aspects of your own ideologies—I've just given you permission to override those, too.

Again, I may never have put the pieces together in this way, but isn't it completely obvious once stated?

The part of my mind that lured me away from my conscience just strengthened itself in me—and it strengthened the *same* part in you.

That's interesting. Normally, my dark part and yours—insofar as I think of them that way—I expect them to be *fighting* each other. And yet when it's laid out so clearly, it's pretty obvious that it can't work that way, right?

And going forward, we will both be more likely to act in ways that strengthen the same part in others, won't we?

Is this really what I wanted? Sure, I got something out of it, but in exchange for what? A darker world? That sounds like a Faustian bargain.

The only reason I accepted it was that the vast majority of its implications were hidden from me. I mean, they were all right there for me to see if I had looked, but I was turned away.

---

This part of me: it's not my friend. Well, except when it's in control of me, at which point it's more than just my friend—it feels like *me.*

Have you ever been so angry you didn't care what it destroyed—as long as it made them feel it?

While you were in it, it felt like you. Like you were finally seeing clearly; cutting through all the noise, etc.

But afterward, didn't it feel like "whoa, that wasn't me?" It felt almost like you were possessed.

Every time we hand control over to this thing, it feels increasingly like us. We defend it with more vigor. And it gains increasingly clever ways of convincing us to give it control.

---

Consider: the fact that I behave this way this means I know exactly how it's possible for a fundamentally decent person—myself—to act with great malice. It doesn't require *inherent evil*.

And yet when I look at you, I don't just *think* you're bad, I can practically *see* it; *feel* it. Why?

Well, if I recognized you as having been overtaken by your dark part—a part that you don't ultimately want—I would be very careful not to shove you deeper into it, even if I had to fiercely put an end to your behavior, wouldn't I?

Which part of me doesn't want me to see you that way?

This part of me—it doesn't just lure me with justifications. It manipulates my very perception.

And after our encounter, I'll see you even *more* clearly this way, won't I?

This thing is colonizing my entire mind, bit by bit; gaining more control over my thoughts and perceptions—the only tools I have to detect the subterfuge in the first place.

That seems dangerous.

---


Can you feel how the person seems somehow turned away from themselves, or perhaps from the "Light"?


---


Have you ever been on the receiving end of a dehumanizing gaze? You can *see* the malice, can't you?

Well, my desire for you to dig in is a little malicious, isn't it? And yet I'm pretending it's righteous. That's the "off" feeling you're detecting, and it's what makes you dig in. Malice alone doesn't cause that.

But it's actually worse than that, because I *knew* it would make you dig in.



If I were too obvious about it—if you could see that I knew—you wouldn't fall for it, would you?

But if it's in limbo for me? I'm still conscious of it, so I can 



It's almost as if the part of me that wanted this outcome also wanted you to *see* that I wanted it. After all, that would actually make it happen, wouldn't it?

Now, I want to be clear about this: it's not that I *consciously* wanted you to see it, in the usual sense of that word. Except here's the thing: the medicine showed me exactly where this desire had been lurking in my conscious mind the whole time. The desire **was** conscious—just more deeply hidden than my mere *hope* that you'd dig in.

And it gets worse.

Anyone who's been on the receiving end of contempt knows that this unique combination—of appearing righteous on the surface yet secretly malicious underneath—is enough to make anyone dig in. So I also knew it on the delivering end. It wasn't just a desire—it was an *intent.*

This is what contempt **is**: the secret intention to make you worse while pretending it's not my fault.

---

But why on Earth would I want to make my enemies worse?




What happens when you do dig in?


Your digging in wasn't accidental, and it wasn't just an unfortunate side-effect of my good intentions: **it was secretly the whole point.** I was just telling myself pretty stories about how good it would be—and buying them so completely that they became "true" for me.

Which meant that when you did dig in, I could only see it as your fault. Because not only did you fight back against my righteous behavior—which only an evil person would do—you were implicitly accusing *me* of being evil. How *dare* you. This world is even worse than I thought—licensing me to ignore my conscience a little more. To fight for good, of course.

And in case you didn't see this coming: *part of me knew that, too. That the whole thing was a ruse designed to free me a little more from my conscience.*

Let that sit for a moment.

## Plausible Deniability

It's difficult to unfold all the layers of this trap. Just to give you a taste: for me to hold it against you, I couldn't know that I caused it. But at the same time, there's no way for me to cause it without part of me knowing that I am.

So there are two parallel (conscious) layers of mind operating simultaneously and semi-independently. The left hand doesn't know what the right is doing. One does the dirty work while the other is kept clean.

This is the origin of plausible deniability. It doesn't start in governments or organizations, but right here in the individual psychology of *good people.* The "dark operative" doing dirty work while the "official part" maintains innocence? That architecture doesn't get imposed top-down. It blossoms from the bottom up; the natural, inevitable result of millions of us doing exactly this.

And then what do we feel when we locate the people up top "responsible for it all?"

*Contempt.*

We'll come back to that later.

---

## Feeling Limbo

We left one important question unanswered: _how_ did that part of me reveal itself to you—especially given that it was hidden from myself?

Imagine (if you will) being on the receiving end of a dehumanizing gaze. Can you feel how the person is somehow turned away from themselves—or perhaps away from the "Light"?

As we'll see later, it's impossible for me to do this without hiding something from myself—basically, your humanity. So I **cannot** wish harm or act selfishly without entering limbo—and that's what you see. 

**My limbo state is generally visible to you**—if only subconsciously. Notice how peculiar this is: hiding it from myself **is** what reveals it to you.

---
## Hall of Mirrors

Now, malice alone may send a shudder down your spine, but it probably doesn't make you dig in. For that, an extra ingredient is necessary: the pretense of good. That pair is what contempt *is*.

This combination—malice with the pretense of good—is something we both instinctively recognize. And because we both know it, it gives rise to a peculiar back-and-forth:

At first, I'm hiding my malice while pretending it's good. But part of me knows you (correctly) recognize this combination as hypocrisy—and that sucks.

So now I must also hide that from myself. But you now (correctly) recognize it as a kind of ruse.

So I hide that, too. But now you recognize that I'm trying to cover it up...

Resulting in a kind of hall-of-mirrors effect. You feel it as a maddening sense of "we both know what I'm really doing, and that it cannot be proven from the outside—so I'll never be forced to admit it, even to myself." And **that** is what ultimately ensures you dig in.

Notice how bizarre this is: I made you lose a bit of faith in humanity by showing you that even the so-called "good people" (me) are willing to harm you for their own gain. But what was the actual harm? It was... showing you that good people are willing to harm you for their own gain. That's circular.

It is the whole recursive structure of **hiding** of my true intention that **reveals** it, turning it into a self-fulfilling prophecy—and it required a careful orchestration of our "conscious" and limbo parts. (Analytical readers will appreciate the full gory details in the Appendix: Hall of Mirrors.)

---
## Simplified

You can also choose to look at the whole thing more simply: my willingness to turn away from my Light is what licenses you to do the same. Embracing my darkness empowers you to embrace yours.

Put another way: when you see me—a "good person"—ignoring my own conscience, you realize this world is even shittier than you thought, licensing you to ignore yours.

These are all equivalent formulations. In each case, part of me wanted you to see it—but since I "don't know" that, I see *you* as the bad one, giving me permission to do it more. It results in a downward spiral we're all familiar with.

---
## Hijacking Goodness

Now I don't just accuse you of being a *bad person* for no reason at all. It's (usually) because I see *you* being out of integrity in some way. I see something dark in you, and I feel compelled to attack it. Morally obligated.

I'm not just accusing you of doing something wrong. It's as if I perceive that darkness as being *inherent to your very nature*. And, having finally caught hold of this essence of *what's wrong with the world*, I'm not going to let it get away. I must punish it.

But in that moment, I cannot separate *it* from *you.* The sense of your inherent badness is somehow baked into my very perception of you. I don't just *think* you're bad—I *see* it; *feel* it. 

Now, I suspect your friends and allies don't see you this way—which means that it's *my own mind* altering my perception of you.

If it didn't—if I recognized you as a confused human like me—I might be able to understand you better and find a healthier (and more effective) way to stop or correct you.

Now, ask yourself: which part of me has an incentive to prevent me from seeing you like that? From giving in to my darkness? Might it be related to the part that lures me away from my conscience with clever rationalizations?

Of course it's the same part. This part of me—it manipulates both my thoughts *and* perceptions to draw me away from my Light. That's what makes it so insidious.

And after this interaction, won't I see you as even more surely defective, and vice versa? It now has a **tighter grip** on my mind—and yet I'm left feeling even *more* righteous; more confident than before. That sounds like a slippery slope.

Notice how it accomplished all this through hijacking a genuinely good trait: my desire to fight evil. And now I've given it more power over me, which means it can lead me even further from my Light next time.

---
## Thinking Your Way to Good

Similarly, when contemptuously judging bad people, it doesn't just *feel* righteous: you could probably prove that it *is.* (In fact, if this is your first time encountering this whole thing, you might have to re-read the earlier sections to remind yourself that *part of you already knows that it's not.*)

The problem isn't just that first initial thought / perception that lured you away from your Light. Once you're separated from it, your *whole cognitive apparatus* is unknowingly hijacked in service of your dark side—which means that you can't simply think your way out of it, no matter how careful you think you're being.

Have you ever tried to talk someone out of being evil? How well did that work?

And it's not a binary thing: separation from our Light happens along a continuum. Which means you might be in some version of it right now.

In fact, here's a simple test: is it possible for you to feel even a trace malice, contempt, or self-righteousness toward anybody for any reason? If so, it would be very difficult to not let it leak out in their presence, wouldn't it? This means the darkness is still operating in you.

In fact, even if you were somehow free of those dark sentiments, there are still traces of it woven into your perception of reality itself. When you survey the destruction humans have wrought against nature, can you sense how it requires a kind of contempt? We'll unpack that later.

Remember: you already know how to stop bad behavior without contempt. You recalled doing so earlier. I'm not saying it's easy—especially the greater the evil we face—but the **only** reason we ever believe it may not be enough is to license ourselves to pull the above ruse.

---
## Responsibility

You might call this process "unconscious" or "subconscious," and there's something to that. Jung would say this material was repressed into the shadow, genuinely hidden from awareness. 

But when the medicine took me back to a time I'd done this, as much as I resisted seeing it—*and believe me, I resisted*—it was there in consciousness, clear as day. I had **always known it,** but hadn't let myself see it.

This isn't semantic hairsplitting. If it's unconscious, I can tell myself "I'll deal with that later"—it's buried somewhere I can't access right now. If it's limbo, it's conscious. And when I know something consciously and do it anyway, it is **intentional**—I'm just turning away from it. Which means I have a profound responsibility to stop doing that. Right now.

So there is a sense in which it wasn't the real me—and a sense in which it absolutely was. I'll unpack that paradox later, but for now: I'm responsible either way.

---
## Summary

There's something in us that needs our enemies to be fundamentally defective—so it manipulates us into treating them in ways that make both of us worse.

You already knew this. Maybe not explicitly, but it was there in limbo the whole time.

And that's true for everyone. We all have this part. We all know, on some level, what it's doing.

What allows it to keep operating is that it stays in the shadows, where we can pretend not to know.

It's about time we drag it into the Light.

---
## The Medicine

By exposing the deepest layers of my mind, the medicine taught me this: I couldn't run from my lies forever. The very idea that I could was the deepest lie of all.

But more importantly, it showed me _how much better_ it feels when I don't have to. And how, the closer I get to my Light, the more obvious it is that I never _wanted_ to—and neither do you.

That's what I rob from you when I treat you with contempt: I'm nudging you a little further from the part of you that doesn't _want_ to carry the burden of ignoring your Light.

But it showed me so much more.

What I'm about to share isn't easy to face. But if you've made it this far, there's a part of you that's ready to see it.

---
## Interlude

Have you ever treated someone unkindly—perhaps mocking, shaming, or contemptuously judging them—only to discover later that you'd been unfair? That there was something about their story that rendered their behavior more understandable—even if not excusable—and how, if you'd known it at the time, you couldn't have been cruel?

Your perception of them shifted, right? Nothing changed about their outward appearance, and yet you *saw* something you hadn't before. A part of them that just wanted to be free of the pain.

And when you see that, you *can't help* but want to serve it. Not because you're especially noble, or because you calculated it would be "good," but because... it's just... obvious.

The person who corrected you with integrity: they were serving your Light; the *real you*—and they did that by refusing to accept your internal narrative about who you were in that moment; the *false* you. It's like they were reminding you of something you'd temporarily forgotten about yourself—but how?

And they weren't just serving you; they were serving something larger. How did they know these two would go hand in hand—that helping you *would* help the Whole? After all, you may have had different religions, politics, etc. 

And which *part* of them was serving you? In exactly the same way you can't win against your own conscience, didn't it feel like you couldn't win against that part? More importantly: did you even want to?

If they had chosen to treat you with contempt instead: which part of you would that have served? And would that have served the world?

Can you feel how the closer you get to your Light, the easier it is to see in others? It doesn't make you want to fight evil *less*. If anything, it makes you *more* protective of others—but you feel less need to inject your own darkness into it.

Where does this process stop?
