## Evil people

> _The earth is not dying, it is being killed, and those who are killing it have names and addresses._ —Utah Phillips

Can you feel it—the _evil people_ out there, ruining it for the rest of us?

How do they make you feel? How do you want _them_ to feel?

Would some tiny part of you be disappointed to discover they're not *fundamentally* evil—that they're just badly confused but inherently redeemable people like the rest of us? Would that part feel robbed of the right to deliver the righteous vengeance they so richly deserve?

If you had to choose between delivering that vengeance and offering them a pill that would instantly enlighten them—which would you choose? Forget about the "right" answer. Is there a tiny flicker in there that's itching to mash that first button?

There is **nothing** more primally, viscerally satisfying than violently punishing evil. Notice that.

## Contempt and Integrity

Think back to a moment you felt contemptuously judged by another person. No matter how "right" they may have been; even if you *knew* you had done wrong, you still fought back, right? Something felt *off* about them. You could tell they weren't coming from a good place. How?

Now think of a time when someone set you straight with profound integrity. Even if it stung your ego; made you lose face, you had no desire to take revenge, did you? Why not? What could you tell they were serving? It was something greater than both of your personal interests, right?

Now turn it around.

Think of a time when *you* contemptuously judged someone. Even if you tried to hide your contempt, they still dug in their heels, didn't they? And somewhere inside, that resistance confirmed what you already believed.

And finally, a time when you corrected someone with integrity yourself. Perhaps you had to do it with more ferocity; more violence than in the previous case—and yet something in you knew it would ultimately bring *more* peace. *How* did you know?

---

That time you stood in integrity, and the time the person who corrected you did: even if you knew nothing else about them—their politics, their religion, their creed—didn't it feel like you were somehow serving the same thing? What is that?

And the time you stood in contempt, and were treated with contempt: didn't it feel like *those* were somehow serving the same thing? Not just your personal egos, either.

Integrity feels clean from both the inside and outside.

Contempt feels righteous inside but dark, dirty, insincere from the outside.

There's a reason for that distinction.

---

When we mock or shame our enemies, part of us already knows they're liable to dig in, right? And we know there's a way that *doesn't* cause this. So why do we keep doing it? Is it just because we can't help it?

Notice how their digging in brings them one step closer to a condition that can only be solved through violent punishment.

But this can't be right. We're not... trying to maneuver our enemies into a position where we'll be forced to unleash our righteous wrath, right?

*Right?*

I'll share what I found out about myself.

There's a part of me so eager to destroy the evil in the world that when I see even a *flicker* of it in my enemies, I refuse to let it escape. If I were to act with integrity, and their "evil" simply evaporated, I will have lost my chance to punish the thing responsible for all the pain—and I'll be damned if I let that happen.

But I cannot admit to myself in the moment that this is what I'm doing, because it's *dark*—and I'm a good person. The problem is, they sense it anyway—and it makes them see *me* as slightly evil. But this implicit accusation convinces me I was right about them—because only a defective person would act that way—which forces me to escalate my contempt.

It is a self-fulfilling prophecy. My invisible need to see people as *inherently defective* subtly infects my behavior in ways that nudge them toward reinforcing my perception.

What the medicine did for me was lay bare the internal mechanics of this mechanism. It showed me how it operates across all areas of my life. Perhaps more importantly, I saw how it scales far beyond immediate interpersonal dynamics.

## The Darkness

This part of me—my dark side—intentionally reveals itself to my enemies to provoke them. At the same time, it hides itself perfectly from me—because if I saw it, then I obviously couldn't let it continue.

Which means that the "real me" clearly doesn't want to be doing this, no matter how much it feels like I do in the moment.

Yet that's not what my enemy sees, is it? They see someone who's intentionally causing harm because it's just what... "people like me" do.

In other words, my dark side isn't just trying to provoke them: it's trying to convince them that I'm *inherently evil.* Because what do humans do when they're convinced they've caught hold of *real evil?*

They abandon all integrity to ensure it's violently destroyed. And how do we perceive someone who's abandoning all integrity to... violently destroy us?

After this interaction, I'm not just more intellectually convinced that you're evil. I can *see* it; *feel* it. I'm less likely to give you the benefit of the doubt in the future. And the same is true of you.

Both of our dark parts have just been **strengthened.**

---

The dark part of me and the dark part of you: they're not fighting each other. They're *collaborating* while making us *believe* we're fighting.

My darkness has a million tricks to convince me that this isn't really true—that sometimes it really *is* necessary, or that what I'm doing isn't *really* dark. And yet every time I fall for it—*every single time*—I end up strengthening it in myself and others, while feeling increasingly confident that I'm only acting righteously. It becomes increasingly difficult for anyone to pull me out.

That's where the "evil people" are trapped: in a narrative of such overwhelming conviction that there's *no way* they could be wrong. They're "finally seeing clearly." Cutting through all the noise. Etc. There's an internal consistency to their story that resists puncture—because they're in too deep. There's no way they can back down without having to face the darkest truth imaginable: that they've transformed fully into the monster they thought they were fighting.

And every time we treat them with contempt, we're pushing them deeper *into* that delusion.

But the worst part is that it's **not by accident.** Something in me is ensuring they stay trapped there—because what would it mean about me to discover that they were always redeemable? That they were caught in a version of the same trap I am—and that I've been knowingly keeping them stuck there instead of helping them exit?

So there's no way *I* can back down now. Except that I *really fucking better*—unless I want to join them in that impossibly dark place.

I'm going to call this part of me the "parasite," for reasons that I hope are clear: I don't actually w

Here's the punchline: this is the secret mechanism behind **all the evil there ever was**. Even the worst person can only cause harm because the dark part of them is acting through them in exactly the same way.

It's not that they don't know it, exactly. They may know perfectly well that they're hurting people. But it's disguised so perfectly as *righteousness* that it feels to them exactly like mine does to me: the felt *wrongness* is completely absent from the experience.

Well, not completely. When I mock and shame my enemies, there **is** a tiny part of me that knows it's wrong. But I tell myself it doesn't know what it's talking about; that it's being naive.

The thing is, it's not some goodie two-shoes trying to get me to be nice. It's **warning** me—that I'm ceding control to a part of me that's actively working against my deepest interests.

Think about it: do I really *want* a world in which my enemies are dug in? In which we're all violently punishing each other to prove how righteous we are?

Of course not. But the more I give control over to this part of me, the more this feels like the natural order of the world, and not something I'm actively creating.

This is the state most of humanity is trapped in.
