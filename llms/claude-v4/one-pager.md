## Main body

When I see you as a "bad person," I'm not just accusing you of disobeying your conscience more than I do; it's as if I perceive the *badness* to be inherent to your very being. So I can't help but treat you with contempt.

This makes you see *me* as bad in the same way. Here's someone who's accusing you of being a bad person while being nasty themselves.

So you dig in your heels and feel justified ignoring your conscience *more.* Not just with me, but in general—because people are even shittier than you thought. That toxicity then gets passed on to others, in a ripple effect.

Did I know this would happen as I was doing it? Yes and no. Part of me kind of knew it, but I convinced myself it would somehow produce a net good. And now that I see the harm it's caused, it's even harder for me to own up to, so I bury it deeper, pretending I never knew or that it's your fault—you are *bad,* after all. I would never dig in my heels when treated with contempt!

So if part of me already knew this, then why did I do it? Where did that compulsion come from?

On one level, it's like this: when I see the darkness in you, I (correctly) identify it as *what's wrong with the world.* So of course I attack *it*—which I can't separate from *you.*

On a deeper level, it's a bit darker. All the evil I see in the world—every bone in my body needs to know that it's caused by something totally alien to me; by people fundamentally different from me. Because if not? If all the pain I've been adding to the world has somehow contributed to the world's evil? That would be *devastating*. So part of me needs to make you worse until I can prove you're utterly beyond redemption. You're **nothing** like me—you're one of *them*.

This is a deeply shameful admission, which is why we rarely let it into consciousness. (Except that it's not actually unconscious: it's just in limbo.) **Part of us is more than happy to darken the world to hide our own shadow.** This knowledge is available if we choose to look.

But on a deeper level still, something even more bizarre is happening.

The darkness that ripples out—notice how it's indiscriminate, affecting friends and enemies alike. More people giving in to self-deception in response to a world that's slightly darker than before.

And it's not just contempt that does this. _Every_ time I skirt or ignore my conscience—which is far more often than I'd like to admit—I'm subtly darkening the world. Every time I'm dishonest, cut corners, take what isn't mine, ignore someone in need. Each act of "turning away" makes it slightly easier for others to do the same. And that's true of you, too.

Which means that the dark parts of us aren't actually opposing each other—they're perfectly aligned. Every time I give in to mine, I'm giving more ammo to yours.

Think back to the Prelude—that tiny part of you desperate to mash the "righteous vengeance" button. How do you think that looks to your enemy when it's online? They recognize it as the same darkness that lives in them, and it empowers theirs, because look: their victims aren't so innocent after all.

This is a **secret handshake** between our darknesses. Yours reveals itself to me, tricking me into viciously attacking you, which mine *knows* will provoke yours. They both wanted this.

Think about it: I don't just *think* of you as a bad person; I *feel* it in you, *see* it in you. I'm sure your friends and allies don't see you that way. Something in *my* mind is inducing that perception so that I feel morally compelled to attack. This part of me—do you think it's the same thing or a different thing than the part that's producing the justifications?

If I didn't see you that way—if I saw you as the imperfect being that you are—wouldn't I try to *help*? Or at least try not to *provoke*?

You've corrected people with integrity before. You *know* it can be done fiercely—even violently—without provoking their darkness. You *know* that contempt will do that. Which part of you would want to make you forget?

The darkness: it isn't me, and it isn't you. But it *lives* in us, and when it hijacks our minds, it *feels* like us.

Have you ever been so angry you didn’t care what it destroyed—as long as it made them _feel it_? In that moment, it felt like you. It felt like you were seeing more clearly than you ever had, right? And yet in retrospect, doesn't it feel like "*whoa, that wasn't me?*" It feels like *possession.*

I'm not asking you to believe in literal demons, but I'm also not saying it's _just_ a metaphor. There's something coordinating here that's smarter than it should be if it were just individual psychological defense mechanisms. Notice that, and stay curious about what it is.

What I _can_ tell you as pragmatic fact: as long as I perceive it as _you_, I _will_ spread more darkness somewhere, somehow, while feeling righteous about it. It's inevitable. Even if I have the restraint to not directly attack you, I will exude contempt in a way that ensures I darken the minds around me. I will subtly license myself to cut corners just because you exist, and you're the *real* problem.

And the thing is, they're not working independently. They're *coordinating.*

When I gather with my allies to scheme against you, ours are working together, beneath our "conscious" thresholds. Have you ever felt that? The way something in the room shifts—how quickly strategy slides into mockery, concern into contempt? Someone makes a cruel joke, everyone laughs a little too hard, and slowly we unleash our dark sides.

It's as if there's an _unspoken force_ moving through the group—a tacit agreement that needs no words: *Let's stop playing nice. If it's darkness they want, it's darkness they'll get.* You can feel everyone silently giving each other permission, coordinating without ever saying it directly.

And if you dare name it out loud—"Hey, maybe this isn't right"—that unspoken force turns on you. You're naive. You don't understand what we're up against. The group ejects you not through explicit decision, but through that same wordless coordination. Because if you made it explicit, the cover of plausible deniability evaporates, and that *must never be allowed to happen.*

**The darkness thrives in the shadows. It depends on them.**

This is why mobs behave much worse than most of the individuals in them would ever dare alone. It's also why our biosphere is collapsing despite (probably) nobody on Earth explicitly wanting that.

The darkness in me—it does so much more than make me feel contempt for "bad people". The more it grabs hold of me, the more I start seeing other kinds of people as "less than". The stupid people, the crazy people, then those of other religions, races, nationalities. Prison inmates—who cares about their conditions? Animals in factory farms—big deal, they're not sentient anyway. Rainforests—look, we have to appease the shareholders *somehow.*

It's a life-destroying, life-devouring force. 

Consider:

Contempt is the #1 predictor of divorce. Both parties end up feeling like the victim/hero valiantly destroying their evil oppressor. And does that toxicity remain confined to the two of them?

The US is seemingly headed toward civil war. Same dynamic, larger scale.

Okay, but *that* one is being orchestrated by evil elites. Aha! We've caught the *real* source of it all! I know, let's unleash our darkness on them! It'll totally work this time! How *dare* anyone suggest otherwise!

This... thing. It's relentlessly driving us toward Armageddon(s)—situations in which everyone is violently proving how *righteous* they are—and we keep falling for it.

Wise people have been warning us about this since forever—to have compassion for evildoers. **They're not telling us to be nice**. Of course we must fight evil! They're just telling us not to *feed the darkness*. Why do we mishear them? Is it because we don't have the capacity to understand?

No! The same cover of darkness that operates within political factions operates at the global scale. Our shared darkness *ensures* that we misunderstand; that we never develop resources that could finally shine Light on the horrifying game we're all participating in.

It's not that such resources don't exist. Various wisdom traditions have been pointing us to the problem and its solution for millennia. But we somehow keep finding ways to sideline them or treat them as self-help.

**They're not self-help. They're the only weapon we have against the Darkness.**

The way our darkness separates us from our Light is impossibly clever. Consider:

The vengeance you want to unleash on the "bad people." Feels righteous, doesn't it?

The times you've fought back with fierce integrity. Also feels "righteous," yeah?

And yet those two feelings aren't the same at all, are they? How can one word have two diametrically opposite meanings? Why didn't someone stop and say "hey guys, maybe this isn't such a great idea?"

Because it wouldn't have made a difference.

When we're in contact with our Light, we know it. We don't know *how* we know it, but we do. And if we try to pin it down in words, the darkness just borrows that language to draw us away.

Your Light **is** the thing that tells you when you're connected to it. So the further you drift from it, the less it's able to warn you. It never actually gets quieter, but we're somehow less able to hear it.

**Any time you are following your thoughts about right and wrong without being firmly connected to your Light, you are following the wrong voice without knowing it.** If you're telling yourself "I AM firmly connected to my Light," same thing.

I can't give you a checklist. If I could, the darkness would just use the checklist to fool you. The only way to know is to know. But here's what I can tell you: when you're truly connected to it, you _know_. Not as certainty or conviction—those can be faked—but as a kind of recognition. And when you're not, there's a subtle tension, a defensiveness, a need to prove you're right.

I'm far from mastering this myself, and teaching it isn't the main point of this work. But know that there are plenty of traditions meant to do exactly this. We've just written them off as mere "religion" or "spirituality." Which part of us might have wanted that?

I won't direct you to any particular tradition—you'd never know if it's just _my_ darkness talking. This is something each of us has to find for ourselves. Whatever access you have to your Light right now—*that's* what you can trust to guide you. It's literally the *only* thing you can trust.

I mean, just look: when you're contemptuously judging your enemies, aren't you certain of all the good it will do? Couldn't you even *prove* it if pressed? And as we saw, it doesn't just manipulate your thoughts, but your perceptions, too.

Have you ever tried to talk someone out of being evil? How well did that work?

What starts off as a few tiny justifications grows into an entire mutually-supporting network of interlocking beliefs with internal consistency that you literally *cannot* think your way out of. It is a self-sealing trap.

How could you be sure you're not trapped in some version of it right now? Maybe not to the same degree as the "evil people," but also not *zero* on that continuum? No amount of thinking harder (or "more clearly") would do it, because the very tools you'd use to detect the subterfuge have been hijacked.

This isn't meant to be spooky. The truth is that every one of us **is** trapped in some version of it. All our agendas, ideologies, projects, etc... they're **all** infected with darkness to a greater or lesser extent. They each contain subtle seeds that will end up benefiting us in some way while harming the world, no matter how noble we can prove they are. We see this easily in the agendas of our enemies, but have a powerful incentive not to see it in our allies'.

**That** is why the world seems to be getting darker despite all our cleverness, and why more cleverness literally cannot fix it. We've turned away from the part of us that can detect the problem. It is why we fetishize rationality and intellect to the exclusion of all else, and why the very idea of an inner Light is written off as "woo." Again: which part of us benefits from that?

---

Let me try to describe what the medicine showed me about finding the way out. You can check this against your own experience.

The closer I get to my Light, the more obvious it is that other people have one, too. That they're just trapped in a variant of the same trap I've been caught in since forever. And this isn't just an idea—it's more like a direct perception.

Maybe you can think of a time when you harshly judged someone, only to discover that their circumstances or life story (or parents' life story...) made their behavior far more understandable (even if not more tolerable). Maybe you still had to stop them—but you *saw* something in them that you couldn't before. What was that? Nothing about their external appearance had changed.

You begin to *see* the patterns operating in people, and how it's not the "real" them.

This is a good time to make an observation about the darkness in us. If we believe it **is** us, then there will always be a layer of shame protecting it, preventing us from examining it too closely (even if we're not "conscious" of it). If we believe it is *not* us, then we'll absolve ourselves of responsibility for all the harm we've caused—and that's not okay. We'll also treat it as some external entity that we have to fight, leading to more contempt. (This is the trap religion sometimes falls into—treating the Devil as something external.)

The truth is stranger than either option. Let's say it is both us and not.

What you experience when someone corrects you with integrity—that's them looking *through* the darkness directly into *you*—into the Light. Their Light is reminding yours that it has a partner in the fight against our primal nemesis.

And when _you_ do that for someone else—when you see through their worst behavior into what they actually are—you're not being naive. You're not letting them off the hook. You're doing the only thing that actually has a chance of reaching them.

Because the darkness thrives when we confirm its story: that some people are fundamentally bad, that they're different from us, that they deserve our contempt. Every time we do that, we're feeding it. Strengthening it. In them and in us.

But when we refuse that story—when we see the Light even in the person doing terrible things—we're starving it. We're refusing to play its game.

That doesn't mean being nice. That doesn't mean not stopping them. That doesn't mean not fighting them with everything you have.

It means fighting _without spreading more darkness_. Fighting while staying connected to what you actually are. Fighting while refusing to confirm their delusion that they're fundamentally separate from the Light.

---


But you don't *have* a Light, you *are* the Light. Not as an idea. It's just how things are when all the self-deception has evaporated. I don't expect you to believe me when I say that, but I'll try to describe the experience anyway.

## Appendix: Hall of Mirrors

You subconsciously know what it looks like for me to turn away from my conscience—and that's what you see when I feel contempt. But on top of that, I'm accusing *you* of being a bad person, and the hypocrisy is too much to bear. So I'm robbing you of a bit of faith in humanity, while pretending not to know—so of *course* you feel entitled to ignore your own conscience. Not just with me, but in general.

This mechanism can be unpacked further. *(This section is for analytical readers. It's pretty involved, and you should feel free to skip it.)*

I cannot feel malice toward you without hiding something from myself, and I cannot hide this without you seeing it. Which means that as soon as I feel it, you sense my hypocrisy. And part of me knows you're right, so I'm forced to hide that, too—which you also see, now recognizing it as a ruse. I sense you're right about that, so I have to hide it, too...

Resulting in a kind of hall-of-mirrors effect where I'm conveying something like: "*we both know what's really happening here, but I know you can't prove it, which means I'll never be forced to admit it, even to myself.*" And that recursive hypocrisy is what actually makes you dig in.

It created what game theorists call *common knowledge*—where both parties know that both parties know that both parties know *ad infinitum.* And I already knew it would, which is why I did it.

The reason this is possible will become clear later.
