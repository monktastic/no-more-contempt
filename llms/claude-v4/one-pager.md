## Conscience

Have you ever done something you knew was wrong at the time, but couldn't fully admit it to yourself until later? Maybe you made a cruel comment to boost your ego, took credit for someone else's work, or cheated on a test (or even partner).

To enable it, you had to convince yourself it wasn't "really" wrong, didn't you? And you really believed it—right up until you could admit it, at which point you saw that you had been lying to yourself.

Here's the bizarre part: at that point, you could look back and realize that you had never really believed your own lie. You always knew it would come back to bite you, even if nobody else ever found out. And that knowledge wasn't locked away in some unconscious realm: it had been **conscious the entire time**. You were just turned away from it.

Let this sink in: there are things we *know* we're doing wrong, that we don't realize we know, until much later—at which point we discover that we always had.

Such knowledge exists in what I call the "limbo state"—a paradoxical schism of mind in which we simultaneously know and yet do not.

---

Limbo lies on a continuum. Here's some knowledge that I was shown had existed in deep limbo for me.

When I mock or shame my enemies, part of me just wants them to feel bad, quite independent of any good it will do. Of course I'd *also* like them to change, and that feels like the main reason I do it, but it's not. Here's the actual underlying need.

If they turned out to be fundamentally decent but deeply confused people—like me—then all my past cruel behavior would reveal something dark about me that I'd rather not face. So I need them to be fundamentally, irredeemably bad—which means it would help if I made them *worse.*

It turns out that a great way to make people worse is to be a complete hypocrite—for example, by nastily accusing them of being bad, knowing that this very behavior is meant to make them worse, and so is itself bad. Yes, this is circular—I make them worse by revealing my hidden intention to make them worse—but it *works.*

That's a lot to unpack.

First: if this intention is "hidden" (from myself—I wouldn't want to know I'm this rotten), how could I reveal it to you, my enemy?

The short answer is *limbo*. To perpetrate this ruse, I have to ignore my own conscience, because it knows exactly what I'm doing. I must convince myself I'm only "fighting evil," and really believe it. At the same time, I know the truth is not perfectly hidden—not from me, and not from you.

Yes, that's right: my limbo is not hidden from you. When I treat you with contempt, you can tell I'm not being entirely honest, can't you? Well, that's what you're sensing: my limbo.

This is both a blessing and a curse. On one hand, it means you know I'm being a hypocrite—which is normally bad. But in this case, it's great! Because if I just convince myself I don't know *that*—another level of limbo—then not only will I never have to confront it, but it will drive you even more crazy. And this limbo-ception doesn't stop at two levels; it just keeps going.

And why do I know this will make you worse? This is also tricky to unpack.

It turns out I know that the only reason *you* do wrong is essentially the same reason I do. I *want* to obey my conscience—because I feel much lighter that way—but this shitty world sometimes forces my hand. I've been hurt in ways other people cannot imagine—just as you have—and I know the world won't take care of my needs. Just look at how awful people are! So I cut myself a little extra slack.

For example, I license myself to be a little cruel to others while calling it "fighting evil"—because who in their right mind would blame me for that? Only bad people! Because it's *good!*

Except I know you know what I'm doing—that I must disobey my conscience to do this. We *all* know this—it's just so deep in limbo that we somehow can't admit it yet.

Which means I know that when you see me do this, you'll think "man, this world is even shittier than I thought!"—which will license you to disobey your own. Of course, you won't think of it that way—nobody does—you'll just feel that the world has forced your hand, and so it's justified.

From the outside, all I'll see is that you became worse—in response to my righteous behavior!—and so I was right! You really are an awful person! Man, this world is even shittier than I thought.

*The kid gloves must come off...*

Why do I feel so comfortable admitting all this? It sounds depraved—and it is! In fact, that was the first punchline the medicine showed me in no uncertain terms:

>*Every single act of unkindness I've ever perpetrated contains the essence of all the evil there ever was—and in so doing, lowered the threshold for others to do the same.*

What is that essence? What do I mean by "unkindness"? It all comes down to a single lie:

>*I'm better than you.*

It's not a lie I believe consciously—because only an asshole would believe that. It's a lie I tell myself implicitly, but *all the fucking time*. Every time I scoff at you for your beliefs; every time I tell myself "well *I* could never do that..."; every time I pat myself on the back for what a good human I am. Heck, even as I sit here writing this now, acting like I've got it all figured out.

Well I don't, okay? I'm just a regular guy. I still catch myself being unkind. Being a hypocrite. Even after having seen all this.

(And in case you're worried, I am NOT saying "don't judge Hitler." But I AM saying that perceiving yourself as ontologically different from him will lead to trouble. More on that later.)

So I'm not here to lecture you. But there's still a big reveal coming, and I think you should see it. And I realize how grandiose this sounds, but: I think we all should, before it's too late.

---

When I look back on my past misbehavior, it somehow doesn't feel like the "real me"—and not just because I'm trying to excuse myself. It *was* of course me, and I'm fully responsible for it. But here's the thing.

There's a reason I have to hide stuff in limbo to do wrong—and why you have to, also: because if we could really see it clearly, there's no way we could do it. Try imagining it yourself—doing something you know is wrong, while **fully** knowing it, no justifications. You can't, can you?

Or here, try this: go find someone you've hurt. Mocked, shamed, contemptuously judged, or were otherwise unkind to. Get to know the details of their life story intimately. Of their parents'. Then see if you want to hurt them again. You already know you it'll be much harder, right?

What does that tell you?

You don't actually want to hurt anyone. You don't want to put yourself ahead of others. It *hurts*.

And it's *not me.* Think about it: when you're in a blind rage, it may feel like you in the moment, but looking back? It feels like "whoa, that wasn't me," right? You almost feel *possessed.*

In fact, any time you skirt your conscience—tell a white lie, exaggerate to feel more right, take more than you deserve—it feels like this part is sneakily taking control, doesn't it? And every time we do these things, don't we make it a little easier for others to do them, too?

So here's a part of us that doesn't feel like us until it takes control, at which point it does, and then nudges the world in a direction we don't actually want, but which it does. Because a more selfish world is exactly the kind in which we'll hand even more control over to it!

It's beginning to sound like a parasite. I call it "the darkness."

When I treat you with contempt, I give you more reason to embrace yours—and, seeing this, I embrace mine more, too. And then we go and pass that on to others.

My darkness and yours: they aren't *fighting* each other—they're collaborating, while making us believe we're fighting! It's spreading itself *through* us!

When I viciously judge you for being a *bad person*?

- On one level, I'm virtuously fighting you.
- One level down, I'm darkening your mind to prove you're the bad one. I win, you lose.
- But deeper still? The darkness itself orchestrated this dance so that *it* wins while humanity loses.

It is a secret handshake between my darkness and yours. Once you see this, you cannot unsee it. **Contempt (for people) is a secret handshake of the darkness. Always.**

When wise people urge compassion for evildoers? They're not being naive. They're not telling us to be nice. They're warning us *not to feed our Nemesis.*

Every time we do, we hand it a little more control. We feel a little guilty about it, but shove that knowledge deeper into limbo. We start looking away more, and it begins to feel more and more like us...

---

Until one day it simply IS us. At which point we will defend this thing to the death rather than admit that we buried the *real* us under countless layers of self-deception. Because what a fucking horrifying thing to have to confront.

And then people will call us "evil," and they will treat us with... contempt.

Let me make this visceral for you, because it's what I saw on the trip. To do that, first let me ask:

Can you recall a time someone corrected you with fierce integrity? How did it feel? It may have stung your ego, but did you want revenge? 

It's like they saw something in you that you'd temporarily forgotten, right? A look that said "I know you're better than this."

And can you remember time where you offered this to someone else? Can you feel how you could have just as easily pushed them deeper in, with just the right


So here I was, confronting an *evil person* as the good guy I was. All the layers of limbo were there for me to see in this retrospective, somehow—which isn't that strange because remember: it's just conscious-but-hidden. It had been there for me to see even at the time, but I chose not to notice.

From this perspective—which, I can't stress enough, is there for all of us *right now*—I saw the part of him buried under all the layers of self-deception. And I had a choice to make: I could act with integrity. Fight him without adding to his burden—and therefore, the world's. But you know what else I realized?

Society won't blame me for keeping him trapped. We need to hide our shadows somewhere, lest ours be exposed—and what better place than in the people we've already decided are beyond redemption? We call it "righteous."

So that's what I did.

And he *knew I knew this.* Not consciously, of course. Well yes consciously, but so hidden we don't use that word for it.

All it took was a glance that reminded him: I could be the one that reminds you there's still Light left in society. But nobody's going to blame me for shoving you deeper in.


---

That deep need I mentioned earlier—to know that I'm not the bad one—it subtly nudges me to engage in behaviors that make other people bad, so that I will know I was right all along.




And then maybe you feel a little guilty or shameful for having done it, so what do you do? Bury 

---


Not because we're especially noble people. Because we know we're all in this together.

To cause pain to that person, something in you had to shield yourself from their humanity. And you don't actually need to know their life story to un-shield—that's just what you're like before all the pain, confusion, insecurity that made shielding feel necessary. You *want* to empathize with people, underneath all the noise.

Oh yeah, so. The deeper I am in limbo; the more shielded I am, the less it feels like me. Think about it: when you're in a blind rage, it may feel like you in the moment, but looking back? It feels like "whoa, that wasn't me." You almost feel *possessed.*

And in that state, you push the world toward conditions you don't actually want. You don't want your enemies to dig in, and you certainly don't want them to pass that toxicity on to others—which they will.




That's the great lie: that there are *bad people.*

Try this: imagine what it would be like to turn that shielding knob up to its maximum.

Or: imagine giving someone a dehumanizing glare. Go out in public and do it.

Oh, you won't? Why not? Because it's **evil.**

That's right: evil people don't do a *different* thing than the rest of us; they just have a more complete version of the *same* thing.

By no means am I asking you to sympathize with them, or God forbid, be nice to them.
