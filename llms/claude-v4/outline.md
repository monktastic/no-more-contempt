# Part 1

Part 1 starts with experiential invitations and then walks through a scenario where I'm mocking / shaming my enemy. The punchline is that I am intentionally trying to darken their minds (and it is the contempt that does it).

**Insights**
- Limbo state is visible (and looks like a mild version of the dehumanizing glare. Turned away from themselves or the "Light").
	- **What they'll intuit**:
	- The Light = whatever integrity serves / that thing you can't quite name but you know when you're aligned with it / conscience, but bigger / the opposite of the darkness they've already felt
	- **"I've always known there was a Light. I just never said it out loud."**
- Hall of Mirrors
- Inherently defective (that's what makes it okay to hurt them, and it's also what I hope to prove)
- Three strikes as cover story
- I was **intentionally** trying to darken their minds

**What reader knows at end**
- Light:
- Darkness:
- Why I (intentionally) darken minds:

**Outline**
- Limbo and conscience
- 4 contempt/integrity examples
	- The two integrity cases serving same thing; two contempt cases too. What were they serving?
	- Clean from inside and outside vs clean inside dirty outside
- When I mock/shame an enemy and they dig in, I feel dismay and relief / satisfaction.
	- Expected satisfaction was there while I was doing it
	- They're sensing my limbo state
	- How? Think of receiving a dehumanizing glare

- Exercise: open your heart. Isn't it easier to see the Light in others this way?
- My/the light. integrity example.
- What shielding is like, how evil people just shield more completely

- How limbo state feels like being possessed
- Clarification: isn't there a danger to saying "I won't fight this evil, because I can't do it without contempt" (and then being complacent)? YES.

- We don't disobey conscience because of the justifications. We do it because we **choose to follow** the justifications. We don't have to. We follow the ones that give us plausible deniability. That's the origin.

# Part 2

- All the ways I spread darkness.
- All of these things subtly darkened the ambient environment, which I would then judge other people for.
- All the benefits I was receiving—were they worth all the darkness I was creating? No!
	- And I knew all this. So why was I doing it?
- On one level: this is just how the world works. It's harsh out there, and we have to fend for ourselves.
- Deeper level: I wasn't ready to confront the darkness in myself. Contempt has exactly the same "signature" as all evil. Which means all the horrible things in the world weren't cleanly separable from my own contribution. And that was completely intolerable.
- Had to ensure I kept the "evil people" trapped by seeing them as inherently evil.


- Should include an example of how I had a choice to see light/dark in others.
- Darkness sneaking around in my mind.

Interlude: how it feels like a parasite
