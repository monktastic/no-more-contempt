# Part 1

Part 1 starts with experiential invitations and then walks through a scenario where I'm mocking / shaming my enemy. The punchline is that I am intentionally trying to darken their minds (and it is the contempt that does it).

**Insights**
- Limbo state is visible (and looks like a mild version of the dehumanizing glare. Turned away from themselves or the "Light").
	- **What they'll intuit**:
	- The Light = whatever integrity serves
	- The Light = that thing you can't quite name but you know when you're aligned with it
	- The Light = conscience, but bigger
	- The Light = the opposite of the darkness they've already felt
	- **"I've always known there was a Light. I just never said it out loud."**
- Hall of Mirrors
- Inherently defective (that's what makes it okay to hurt them, and it's also what I hope to prove)
- Three strikes as cover story
- I was **intentionally** trying to darken their minds

**Outline**
- Limbo and conscience
- 4 contempt/integrity examples
	- The two integrity cases serving same thing; two contempt cases too. What were they serving?
	- Clean from inside and outside vs clean inside dirty outside
- When I mock/shame an enemy and they dig in, I feel dismay and relief / satisfaction.
	- Expected satisfaction was there while I was doing it
	- They're sensing my limbo state
	- How? Think of receiving a dehumanizing glare
