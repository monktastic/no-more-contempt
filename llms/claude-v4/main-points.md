- Conscience and the limbo state 
	- How we can know something, consciously, but not realize we did until afterward—at which point we see we always did.
	- How our conscience doesn't need to justify itself.
- The mechanism that draws us away from the Light. How devious, insidious it is.
	- How it imitates the Light (violent anger and fierce integrity both feel "righteous," but in drastically different ways. Any word you try to use to describe to yourself whether you're with your Light will get usurped by the darkness.)
- We've always known that our contempt makes our enemies worse.
	- We knew that even before we did it.
	- It was the hidden purpose.
		- How it actually works (hall of mirrors)
	- We can't help it, because we see genuine darkness in you.
		- On a deeper level, we WANT the world to be darker ("every bone in my body...")
	- We don't actually like what it produced (a darker world)
- This mechanism "isn't us" (but the Light is). It's a kind of parasite.
	- Oh shit, we're not using our darkness; it's using us
- It modifies our perception so that it feels like it IS them (they are inherently evil)
	- How this makes us feel morally compelled to attack
	- **How this only strengthens theirs, through a kind of secret handshake**
	- Thinking cannot tell you whether you've been separated, because your whole cognitive apparatus has been hijacked.
	- Feedback loop that drives us further from our Light while we feel increasingly convinced we're becoming more righteous (**that's where "evil people" are trapped, in an internally-consistent worldview. Their mechanism is the same as ours.**).
- How all our darknesses are collaborating to produce Hell on Earth.
	- Factory farms, prisons, rainforests getting destroyed — all same cause.
	- Examples of smaller-scale collaboration (e.g., darkness among allies joined in contempt)
	- How our systems are designed to prevent us from discovering this.
- The closer we get to our Light, the more clearly we see it in others.
	- The more we see into the reasons they are turned away
	- The more power we have to end it
	- **Secret handshake between the Light**
	- **This is the only way to fight it without creating more**
- Until we are free of darkness, it is just biding its time in our mind
	- Expressing itself through various channels ("conscience skirting")
	- Waiting for opportunities to grow. How "good people" commit genocides.
	- The existence of a dividing line between "people who deserve my compassion" and "those who deserve my contempt" exists only to serve this thing.
		- Compassion is nothing but fighting it, can be fierce or even violent
	- All our ideologies, agendas, projects are subtly infected.
		- How that infection spreads through people.
	- "I'll just try to be a better person" doesn't work.
