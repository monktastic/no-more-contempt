# Chapter VI: Absence as Presence

Perhaps the most maddening thing about the ambiguous nature of the parasite is that on one hand, it has no inherent nature of its own; but on the other, it certainly _feels_ like it does.

When we say our enemies _really are bad,_ it's not just an intellectual judgment. We're perceiving something that feels like a real essence of badness in them. You can see it in their eyes, feel it in their presence. They seem hollow, _turned away_ from something fundamental in themselves—but it can also feel like they're possessed by something dark. 

And here's the trap: the more we see them this way, the more we feel compelled to viciously attack it—by attacking them. Which just drives it deeper in. Meanwhile, the _actual_ way to defeat it (by exposing it to the Light—something we'll explore later) feels increasingly naive in the face of what appears to be genuine evil.

This creates a self-reinforcing feedback loop: the worse things get, the worse we make them, at an accelerating rate—and yet the more justified we feel for doing so.

This is compounded by the fact that the further we are from our own Light, the harder it is to believe there is such a thing—let alone that we have one, and that it's our fundamental nature. This makes it correspondingly difficult to consider, let alone see, that our enemies do, too.

To put it simply: our ability to see the Light in others is a function of both how close they are to theirs as well as how close we are to ours.

From this perspective, what contempt does is prevent them from looking closely enough to see that their darkness isn't them.

In extreme cases (e.g., civil wars), both sides—who may even have been close before—now see bottomless evil in each other. Each side genuinely perceives the other as _possessed_ by something that must be destroyed. And they're both right—and both wrong.

Also notice how peculiar it is that people on the _same_ side of a conflict usually don't see each other this way—even when their parasites are fully active. When your ally displays that same contemptuous energy toward your shared enemies, you might even feel _inspired_ by it. They seem fierce, righteous, uncompromising.

But turn that exact same energy toward _you_, and suddenly it feels like bottomless evil. Same mechanism, same possession—different target.

This is another way the parasite maintains plausible deniability: if _everyone_ on my side sees this energy as good when we do it, then surely it _must_ be good, right? The fact that the other side experiences it as evil? Well, that just proves how evil _they_ are.

Here's another thing that can be hard to appreciate. Even if we believe that our enemy has a conscience and can only do wrong by turning away from it, we often still harbor the suspicion that they *want* to be turned away—or that their bad essence makes them more likely to do so, even if all else were somehow equal.

These are all variations of the same basic trick. They're all ways of convincing ourselves that we're fundamentally morally superior—from which contempt inevitably follows.

Later we'll see why people couldn't actually *want* to be turned away from the Light (if they could see what it really was), and give some intuition for why there's no place for a pure essence of badness to be hiding in a person's nature in the first place.

In other words: evil is the *result* of turning away from the Light; not its *cause.*

TODO

- [x] **L0** - We make others feel unsafe (through contempt) precisely so they can never look closely enough to see their darkness isn't them. On one level we know we're doing this. On deeper level: it's not "us" doing it—it's the pattern using us.

- [x] **L0** - Evil is the _result_ of shielding, not its cause. Even if we suspect evil people are just shielding, we still suspect it's because they _are_ evil. Beyond a certain point, it starts feeling like the cause. (Consciousness itself can't be evil)

- [ ] **L1** - We instinctively recoil from harming people when we can see their Light. The more we shield ourselves from it, the easier it becomes to cause harm. Shield it completely? The guardrails come off. You would know what it's like to _be evil._

- [ ] **L2** - Doesn't it feel like wise people aren't hiding anything from themselves? The hiding is the revealing.

- [ ] **L2** - We don't disobey conscience because of the justifications. We do it because we **choose to follow** the justifications. Learning not to turn away is a *skill*.
