# Part 1

## Limbo

Have you ever done something you knew was wrong at the time, but couldn't fully admit it to yourself until later? Maybe you made a cruel comment to boost your ego, took credit for someone else's work, or cheated on a test (or even partner).

To enable it, you had to convince yourself it wasn't "really" wrong, didn't you? And you really believed it—right up until you could admit it, at which point you saw that you had been lying to yourself the whole time.

Here's the bizarre part: at that point, you could look back and realize that you had never really believed your own lie. You always knew it would come back to bite you, even if nobody else ever found out. And that knowledge wasn't locked away in some unconscious realm: it had been **conscious the entire time**. You were just turned away from it.

Let this sink in: there are things we *know* we're doing wrong, that we don't realize we know, until much later—at which point we discover that we always had.

Such knowledge exists in what I call the "limbo state"—a paradoxical schism of mind in which we simultaneously know and yet do not.

---

Here's some stuff that I was shown I had been hiding in limbo.

When I mock or shame my enemies, they tend to dig in their heels. On one level, I'm dismayed: *damn, they really are as bad as I feared*. But on another, I feel a certain satisfaction: *see, they really are as bad as I feared!*

Am I doing it *for* that satisfaction? Of course not—that would make me a bad person!

And yet, on the receiving end, you somehow feel it, don't you? That I want you to dig in your heels, even while I claim I'm only trying to help?

What you're perceiving is my *limbo state.*

*Of course* there was a part of me that wanted this outcome, even as I did it—I just couldn’t admit it to myself. I'd like to call it "unconscious," but that's not quite correct.

And lo and behold: it worked. My hidden intention was enough to bring about the result. But how? No, really: how can my hidden intentions actually result in them happening?

Something in me showed it to you.

But how do I show you something about me that I can hardly see about myself?

---

That's the nature of the limbo state.

As we'll soon see, a person literally *cannot* feel any kind of malice toward you without hiding something from themselves—and that hiding is always visible, to one degree or another.

Imagine what it's like to be on the receiving end of a dehumanizing gaze. Can you feel the sense in which the person is somehow turned away from themselves, or turned away from the Light?

That's what we're conveying to people when we feel contempt, **no matter who the recipient is**: that we're turned away from the Light. This gives them tacit permission to turn away it, too—which we can then judge them for because we "don't know" we caused it.

We *need* our enemies to be the bad guys, and this is how we make them worse without ever recognizing our own role in it.

[mashing the vengeance button.]

## Hall of Mirrors

There are other ways to look at how this worked.

You subconsciously know what it looks like for me to turn away from my conscience—and that's what you see when I feel contempt. But on top of that, I'm accusing *you* of being a bad person, and the hypocrisy is too much to bear. So I'm robbing you of a bit of faith in humanity, while pretending not to know—so of *course* you feel entitled to ignore your own conscience. Not just with me, but in general.

This mechanism can be unpacked further. *(This section is for analytical readers. It's pretty involved, and you should feel free to skip it.)*

I cannot feel malice toward you without hiding something from myself, and I cannot hide this without you seeing it. Which means that as soon as I feel it, you sense my hypocrisy. And part of me knows you're right, so I'm forced to hide that, too—which you also see, now recognizing it as a ruse. I sense you're right about that, so I have to hide it, too...

Resulting in a kind of hall-of-mirrors effect where I'm conveying something like: "*we both know what's really happening here, but I know you can't prove it, which means I'll never be forced to admit it, even to myself.*" And that recursive hypocrisy is what actually makes you dig in.

It created what game theorists call *common knowledge*—where both parties know that both parties know that both parties know *ad infinitum.* And I already knew it would, which is why I did it.

The reason this is possible will become clear later.

---

Now think about a time when someone corrected you with full integrity. Even if it stung your ego, you didn't want revenge, did you? Why not? 

You could feel they were serving something larger than both of you, right? And at the same time, they were serving you—the *real* you, not the confused, misbehaving one.

You could tell they didn't have to hide anything from themselves, couldn't you?

---

Why do these things go together? Being transparent, serving others, serving the greater good?

And the opposite: hiding from yourself and harming others.

Turning away from our Light is what darkens the world.

That’s not a side effect. It’s the *whole point*.

---

Why on Earth would I want to darken the world? Here's what the medicine revealed. And I want to be totally clear about this: it didn't show me anything new. It showed me exactly where this knowledge was already hidden in my conscious mind.

My bluff and bluster as a valiant "good guy" fighting the hordes of evil? It was a front.

Part of me knew there was darkness in me that I wasn't ready to confront. Just to give a small example: part of me had always known that my contempt was making my enemies worse—and that they would go on to spread that darkness to others. That meant that my own fingerprints were on evils I would never see; some of them affecting innocent people—a horrifying thought.

Maybe some of them even contributed to atrocities that I ended up seeing on the news, and for which I felt what for the perpetrators? Compassion?

And there were countless other examples, some of which we'll see later.

Now, what's the best way to hide your darkness from yourself? It's to darken the world out there, so that you never have to face your own. So that yours looks insignificant by comparison.

It's awful, but it's true. The more bad stuff we've done, the harder we have to hide it from ourselves, and so the more darkness we create. And the darker the world appears, the more we feel justified in skirting our consciences more...

That's why the whole world is busy shoving each other deeper into the abyss to prove themselves righteous. We're not ready to confront what's within, so we *must* (contemptuously) judge others.

---

So we don't treat our enemies with contempt to darken only their minds: we do it to darken the *world in general*. We already *know* they'll spread it. What else does someone do in that state?

Of course, it doesn't feel like this on the surface. If it did, it would defeat the purpose.

But here's the thing. If you're a fundamentally decent person—which I assume you are—and you've done wrong before—which I assume you have—then this knowledge is waiting in limbo for you, too, whenever you're ready to see it.

---

So then why do we *think* that contempt for "bad people" will make the world better?

The truth is that we *don't*. Not really. It's just that for most of us, our self-image doesn't allow us to hurt "good people." Which means that to express our darkness, we *need* there to be "bad people."

That's what "bad people" *are*: the people on whom we let ourselves unleash darkness without recognizing what we're doing. If we were free of ours, we would recognize that they're acting from profound delusion—the same kind we have—and couldn't feel even a trace of malice or contempt.

You've been on the delivering end of fierce integrity before, haven't you? Even if it required ferocity—or even violence—you somehow knew it would bring more peace, didn't you? How?

So you already know it's possible to fight evil *without* contempt. Without darkening the world.

I'm not saying it's easy. Not by a long shot. But what does the contempt actually *add*, apart from the darkening?

Nothing.

How could anyone "deserve" contempt, when its purpose is to darken the *world*?

---

When you correct someone with integrity, it feels "righteous." When you correct them with contempt, it feels "righteous." But do those feel like the same thing?

Same word, diametrically opposite meaning. Why would we want to have one word that means both the intent to darken the world and to brighten it?

Which part of us might benefit from that confusion? How did it end up affecting our language? Why didn't anyone stop and say "you know what guys, maybe this isn't such a great idea?"

Because it wouldn't have made a whit of difference.

---

Think back to that time you knowingly did wrong.

The part that knew it was wrong—your conscience—wasn't trying to justify itself. It just... *was.* The justifications weren't there to convince *it*; they were there to convince *you*—that you couldn't hear it; that it was just another voice among the noise.

But it wasn't.

The Light doesn't need justifications. You can tell when you're in alignment with it, but you can't say exactly *how* you know. And if you do try to encode that in language, all that happens is the darkness uses that same language to trick you into following it instead.

Any time we turn away from our (or *the*) Light, we're handing control over to our darkness. People can always sense it, if only "subconsciously"—and it gives them implicit permission to do the same.

[This is a good place to switch to the parasite framing. But make it first seem like they're fighting.]

---

Here's a psychological way to look at it. When I treat you with contempt, here's what you feel:

>*Oh, so you're a "good person"? I can literally **see** the darkness in you—that contemptuous part you're not admitting to yourself. You're just another hypocrite who thinks they're special. Why should I listen to my conscience when you won't listen to yours? Fuck that.*

What you see is a darker world, making you feel more licensed to ignore your conscience *in general.*




There's another way to look at this.

The darkness is *tempting* you away from the Light. And as you turn away from it, you're turning away from yourself.[x]


---

As long as the darkness keeps you focused on your thoughts, you'll never detect that you've been separated from your Light.

Your Light **is** the thing that tells you when you're connected to it—and it doesn't use language to do so. So the further you drift from it, the less it's able to warn you.

The alarm is still there, blaring. But you're turned away from it, so you never notice.

[That's what it means to be evil.]

---

Have you ever tried to talk someone out of being evil? How well did that work?

What starts off as a few tiny justifications grows into an entire mutually-supporting network of interlocking beliefs with internal consistency that you literally *cannot* think your way out of. It is a self-sealing trap.

And it does't just shape your thoughts; it alters your perceptions. Your enemies—you don't just *think* they're bad; you can *see* it; *feel* it, can't you?

This is why you can never detect whether you're the bad guy by thinking harder (or even "more clearly") about it. Your entire cognitive apparatus has been hijacked—including the very tools you rely on to detect the hijack.

That being so, how could you ever tell if you were trapped inside some version of it? Might you be right now?

---

The answer, of course, is that you are.

If you can even *fathom* feeling malice, contempt, or self-righteousness toward anybody for any reason, it's operating in you as you read.

In the Prelude—the part of you desperate to mash the "righteous vengeance" button? That's the darkness keeping its foot in the door of your mind, biding its time.

---

Even if you were somehow free of those dark sentiments, the subterfuge is baked into your perception of reality itself.

We all know that our brains shape our perceptions—in fact, that our perceived reality is a kind of hallucination—except that truth be told, that's a bit of a copout. The same way we want to chalk our shadow up to the "unconscious"—because it's terrifying to admit that it's right there in our conscious mind—we want to blame our perception of reality on "my brain."

Here's what the medicine showed me.

## What This Version Loses

1. **The "need them to be bad" mechanism** is mostly **gone** from this version. The old version tried to show _why_ we do this (to avoid questioning ourselves). This version just asserts "our darkness needs a way to express itself" - which is true but less **mechanistically satisfying**.
2. **The "makes you dig in" causal chain** was clearer in the old version's structure, even if it needed tightening.
3. **The escalation to "evil people"** feels more **abrupt** here. The old version had more buildup through the perceptual shielding section (which I couldn't fully evaluate since it was truncated).
4. **The responsibility section** is gone - which might be good (it broke flow) but that means you're not addressing the trap of treating darkness as external entity vs. collapsing into shame.

**But you lose something valuable from the old version:**

- The **self-executing parasite** insight (lines 177-182) is BRILLIANT
- The **hall of mirrors / common knowledge** connection (lines 184-208) is intellectually satisfying for analytical readers
- The **other person's perspective** (lines 129-143) makes it more viscerally real

---


But our darkness *needs* a way to express itself; to feed itself. So it shapes our perception in such a way that we feel *compelled* to. The idea that it will improve the world is a rationalization.

[When I turn away to show you contempt, I'm revealing my darkness in hopes of provoking yours. And once you embrace it: does that create a better world or a worse one? Do they pass on more care or more suffering? Don't we already know this? which I *know* will empower it and cause it to spread. Of course it doesn't feel like that on the surface—but that knowledge is always there in limbo. Conscious but hidden.]




So, like... what's the game plan here? We're going to keep making them worse until they're... so bad they decide to... repent and forgive us?

No.

Do you remember from the Prelude, the part of us that's desperate to mash the "righteous vengeance" button?

...

Yeah.

---

There is *nothing* more primally, viscerally satisfying than violently punishing evil. 

So it's only natural there's a part of us dedicated to making sure that part stays fed.

That part of us—you think it's the same part we hate in the "bad people," or a different one?

---






And more importantly: if I don't know I'm doing this, what other dark things might I be doing without knowing it?

---

And I **really** need the problem to not be me. I mean sure, I may have some stuff to work on, but I can't be *what's wrong with the world.* That's... other people.

Except that part of me knows this isn't the full story—that there are aspects of my own behavior that I haven't been fully honest with myself about. And I'm not ready to confront that.

So part of me would *really* benefit from my enemies digging in their heels and proving how evil they are—as long as I don't feel like I'm the one who caused it. And a desire that deep doesn't stay confined to my skull. It subtly leaks out in ways others can feel.

You've been on the receiving end of this—where your enemy treats you with *contempt.* It's like they need you to see that you're the bad guy, but something doesn't quite ring true about them. Like they're not being completely honest with themselves, and you can *smell* it.

So you seize on this opportunity to accuse them of being disingenuous. *You can see it so clearly! Obviously they know!* And yet not only do they not admit it, they double down on their accusation. What fucking frauds. You've caught them in the act, and there's no way you're going to let them wriggle out.

But somehow they don't see it this way. They see it as proof they were right about *you*. 

So you both walk away feeling more assured of your positions—that the other guy is the problem.

---

Here's what that looked like from my side—the delivering end.

I *genuinely didn't know* that by treating you with contempt, I wasn't being completely honest. I really thought I was fighting evil!

Except that's not entirely true, is it?

Some small part of me knew that I wanted you to dig in your heels for my own benefit. But that knowledge was so dark I had to hide it from myself—put it in *deep* limbo.

That uneasy feeling you had—that I wasn’t being fully honest—**that was my limbo showing through**.

And it sucks for me that you saw it—except for one little thing: *it's the whole reason you dug in.*

Let that sit for a moment.

The part of me that wanted you to dig in your heels: it needed you to *see* that I wanted this—*and* that I was hiding it from myself. Because what enrages you most isn’t just that I’m being nasty—it’s that I seem to _know_ I’m being nasty while pretending I don’t.

At the same time, it needed to be *genuinely hidden from me*—to not feel like "I'm hiding this from myself"—because then I'd feel like a hypocrite. I need to hold your ridiculous accusation against you and really believe it.

Pause and admire the brilliance of this.

For me to get you to dig in your heels, that intention must feel *genuinely* hidden from me while appearing *disingenuously* hidden to you. Not some mix of the two; not some halfway point. The hiding must be *fully* genuine to me and *fully* disingenuous to you at the same time.

It's a delicate balance.

Because if it looked _genuinely_ hidden to you—like I really didn't know what I was doing—you might pity me or try to help. And if it looked disingenuous but *not* hidden—like I was knowingly baiting you—you'd just call me out on it and know you'd caught me. But when you can sense I'm hiding it from myself while pretending I'm not? *That's* what makes you need to expose me.

In other words, I have to make sure _you_ see my true intent, make sure _I_ don’t, and make sure you _see that I don’t._ I made you worse by revealing my hidden *intention* to make you worse.

---

And it gets crazier.

At some level, I know I'm doing this to you—that not only do I *want* to make you worse; that this will likely *accomplish* it. And just like I had to hide the original dark intent in limbo, now I must hide this, too, because it's even darker.

And you can sense *that*, which I now have to hide. And it doesn't stop at two levels: it just keeps going. You've experienced this before—that hall-of-mirrors effect where it feels like I'm communicating: "*we both know what's really happening here, and that you can't prove it—so I will never be forced to admit it, even to myself."

That infinite recursion is where the full maddening effect comes from. It creates a kind of shared secret that transmits malice in a way that's reliable and yet not provable. As we'll see later, this is one of the key weapons of darkness: *plausible deniability.* Not just externally, but internally.

But how is this whole thing even possible? To answer that, we must go deeper.

---

The more intimately I know you, the harder it is for me to wish harm on you.










---

Think back to that time you knowingly did something wrong. While you were doing it, wasn't your mind creating justifications for why it wasn't *really* wrong?

Notice an asymmetry here: the part that knew it was wrong—your conscience—wasn't trying to justify itself. It just... *was*. The justifications weren't there to convince *it*; they were there to convince *you* that it was just one more voice among the noise.

But it wasn't.

We can never truly silence our conscience—all we can do is learn to ignore it better.

I *want* to obey my conscience—because I feel much lighter that way—but this shitty world sometimes forces my hand. I've been hurt in ways other people can't imagine—just as you have—and I know the world won't take care of my needs. Just look at how awful people are! So I cut myself a little extra slack.

Deep down, I know this is how it works for you, too. And for reasons we shall see soon, I know you suspect this of me, too.

So when I accuse you of being a *bad person*—as though the badness were somehow inherent to your very being—the way it feels to you is:

>*You're going to disobey your conscience while asking me to obey mine? Fuck that.*

I've just made you dig in your heels. Of course, I "don't know" I caused it, which is why I take it as proof that I was right about you. On top of that, you seem to be implicitly accusing *me* of being the evil one. You must be well and truly defective.






---


A ruse this fiendishly precise obviously isn't an accident. Nor can I simply chalk it up to some unconscious part of me

Again, I'd like to pawn it off on my subconscious, but that's not quite correct. I was shown that I was doing this from limbo, too.

"aspects of my own behavior that I haven't been fully honest about."

---

this subtly alters my behavior. I'm quicker to rush to judgement, less likely to give them the benefit of the doubt, etc.


So part of me _needs_ them to be fundamentally, irredeemably bad. Which means—and here's where it gets dark—it would actually _help_ if I made them worse. Not in any obvious way, of course—because that would defeat the whole point. But it subtly influences my behavior. 

The problem is, part of me knows I'm doing this. Sometimes there's a brief flicker of recognition where I realize I have a choice: I could choose to interpret their words charitably, or use those words against them. One might nudge things forward, and the other will only boost my ego (and cause), but nobody can prove that I knew this. Look, I have all the evidence right here: they really *are* pure evil!

So that's what I do. And now comes the second problem: they can somehow sense that I know exactly what I'm doing, but that I'm not letting it on to myself. Which means I'm forced to double down: *How **dare** you accuse me of being the evil one here!*

And that's when I saw what lived even deeper in limbo.

The part of me that needed them to be evil? 



If my enemies turn out to be fundamentally decent but deeply confused people—like me—then all my past cruel behavior would reveal something dark about me that I'd rather not face. It would mean I've been making them worse—which would implicate *me* in the world's problems. 





It turns out that a great way to make people worse is to be a complete hypocrite—for example, by nastily accusing them of being bad, knowing that this very behavior will only lead to a darker world, and so is itself bad. Yes, this is circular—I make them worse by revealing my hidden intention to make them worse—but the truth is, it *works.*

That's a lot to unpack.

First: if this intention is "hidden" (from myself—I wouldn't want to know I'm this rotten), how could I reveal it to you, my enemy?

The short answer is *limbo*. To perpetrate this ruse, I have to ignore my own conscience, because it knows exactly what I'm doing. I must convince myself I'm only "fighting evil," and really believe it. At the same time, I know the truth is not perfectly hidden—not from me, and not from you.

Yes, that's right: my limbo is not hidden from you. When I treat you with contempt, you can tell I'm not being entirely honest, can't you? Well, that's what you're sensing: my limbo.

This is both a blessing and a curse. On one hand, it means you know I'm being a hypocrite—which is normally bad. But in this case, it's great! Because if I just convince myself I don't know *that*—another level of limbo—then not only will I never have to confront it, but it will drive you even more crazy. And this limbo-ception doesn't stop at two levels; it just keeps going.

And why do I know this will make you worse? This is also tricky to unpack.

It turns out I know that the only reason *you* do wrong is essentially the same reason I do. I *want* to obey my conscience—because I feel much lighter that way—but this shitty world sometimes forces my hand. I've been hurt in ways other people cannot imagine—just as you have—and I know the world won't take care of my needs. Just look at how awful people are! So I cut myself a little extra slack.

For example, I license myself to be a little cruel to others while calling it "fighting evil"—because who in their right mind would blame me for that? Only bad people! Because it's *good!*

Except I know you know what I'm doing—that I must disobey my conscience to do this. We *all* know this—it's just so deep in limbo that we somehow can't admit it yet.

Which means I know that when you see me do this, you'll think "man, this world is even shittier than I thought!"—which will license you to disobey your own. Of course, you won't think of it that way—nobody does—you'll just feel that the world has forced your hand, and so it's justified.

From the outside, all I'll see is that you became worse—in response to my righteous behavior!—and so I was right! You really are an awful person! Man, this world is even shittier than I thought.

*The kid gloves must come off...*

Why do I feel so comfortable admitting all this? It sounds depraved—and it is! In fact, that was the first punchline the medicine showed me in no uncertain terms:

>*Every single act of unkindness I've ever perpetrated contains the essence of all the evil there ever was—and in so doing, lowered the threshold for others to do the same.*

What is that essence? What do I mean by "unkindness"? It all comes down to a single lie:

>*I'm better than you.*

It's not a lie I believe consciously—because only an asshole would believe that. It's a lie I tell myself implicitly, but *all the fucking time*. Every time I scoff at you for your beliefs; every time I tell myself "well *I* could never do that..."; every time I pat myself on the back for what a good human I am. Heck, even as I sit here writing this now, acting like I've got it all figured out.

Well I don't, okay? I'm just a regular guy. I still catch myself being unkind. Being a hypocrite. Even after having seen all this.

(And in case you're worried, I am NOT saying "don't judge Hitler." But I AM saying that perceiving yourself as ontologically different from him will lead to trouble. More on that later.)

So I'm not here to lecture you. But there's still a big reveal coming, and I think you should see it. And I realize how grandiose this sounds, but: I think we all should, before it's too late.

---

When I look back on my past misbehavior, it somehow doesn't feel like the "real me"—and not just because I'm trying to excuse myself. It *was* of course me, and I'm fully responsible for it. But here's the thing.

There's a reason I have to hide stuff in limbo to do wrong—and why you have to, also: because if we could really see it clearly, there's no way we could do it. Try imagining it yourself—doing something you know is wrong, while **fully** knowing it, no justifications. You can't, can you?

Or here, try this: go find someone you've hurt. Mocked, shamed, contemptuously judged, or were otherwise unkind to. Get to know the details of their life story intimately. Of their parents'. Then see if you want to hurt them again. You already know you it'll be much harder, right?

What does that tell you?

You don't actually want to hurt anyone. You don't want to put yourself ahead of others. It *hurts*.

And it's *not me.* Think about it: when you're in a blind rage, it may feel like you in the moment, but looking back? It feels like "whoa, that wasn't me," right? You almost feel *possessed.*

In fact, any time you skirt your conscience—tell a white lie, exaggerate to feel more right, take more than you deserve—it feels like this part is sneakily taking control, doesn't it? And every time we do these things, don't we make it a little easier for others to do them, too?

So here's a part of us that doesn't feel like us until it takes control, at which point it does, and then nudges the world in a direction we don't actually want, but which it does. Because a more selfish world is exactly the kind in which we'll hand even more control over to it!

It's beginning to sound like a parasite. I call it "the darkness."

When I treat you with contempt, I give you more reason to embrace yours—and, seeing this, I embrace mine more, too. And then we go and pass that on to others.

My darkness and yours: they aren't *fighting* each other—they're collaborating, while making us believe we're fighting! It's spreading itself *through* us!

When I viciously judge you for being a *bad person*?

- On one level, I'm virtuously fighting you.
- One level down, I'm darkening your mind to prove you're the bad one. I win, you lose.
- But deeper still? The darkness itself orchestrated this dance so that *it* wins while humanity loses.

It is a secret handshake between my darkness and yours. Once you see this, you cannot unsee it. **Contempt (for people) is a secret handshake of the darkness. Always.**

When wise people urge compassion for evildoers? They're not being naive. They're not telling us to be nice. They're warning us *not to feed our Nemesis.*

Every time we do, we hand it a little more control. We feel a little guilty about it, but shove that knowledge deeper into limbo. We start looking away more, and it begins to feel more and more like us...

---

Until one day it simply IS us. At which point we will defend this thing to the death rather than admit that we buried the *real* us under countless layers of self-deception. Because what a fucking horrifying thing to have to confront.

And then people will call us "evil," and they will treat us with... contempt.

Let me make this visceral for you, because it's what I saw on the trip. To do that, first let me ask:

Can you recall a time someone corrected you with fierce integrity? How did it feel? It may have stung your ego, but did you want revenge? 

It's like they saw something in you that you'd temporarily forgotten, right? A look that said "I know you're better than this."

And can you remember time where you offered this to someone else? Can you feel how you could have just as easily pushed them deeper in, with just the right


So here I was, confronting an *evil person* as the good guy I was. All the layers of limbo were there for me to see in this retrospective, somehow—which isn't that strange because remember: it's just conscious-but-hidden. It had been there for me to see even at the time, but I chose not to notice.

From this perspective—which, I can't stress enough, is there for all of us *right now*—I saw the part of him buried under all the layers of self-deception. And I had a choice to make: I could act with integrity. Fight him without adding to his burden—and therefore, the world's. But you know what else I realized?

Society won't blame me for keeping him trapped. We need to hide our shadows somewhere, lest ours be exposed—and what better place than in the people we've already decided are beyond redemption? We call it "righteous."

So that's what I did.

And he *knew I knew this.* Not consciously, of course. Well yes consciously, but so hidden we don't use that word for it.

All it took was a glance that reminded him: I could be the one that reminds you there's still Light left in society. But nobody's going to blame me for shoving you deeper in.

That deep need I mentioned earlier—to know that I'm not the bad one—it subtly nudges me to engage in behaviors that make other people bad, so that I will know I was right all along.




And then maybe you feel a little guilty or shameful for having done it, so what do you do? Bury

Not because we're especially noble people. Because we know we're all in this together.

To cause pain to that person, something in you had to shield yourself from their humanity. And you don't actually need to know their life story to un-shield—that's just what you're like before all the pain, confusion, insecurity that made shielding feel necessary. You *want* to empathize with people, underneath all the noise.

Oh yeah, so. The deeper I am in limbo; the more shielded I am, the less it feels like me. Think about it: when you're in a blind rage, it may feel like you in the moment, but looking back? It feels like "whoa, that wasn't me." You almost feel *possessed.*

And in that state, you push the world toward conditions you don't actually want. You don't want your enemies to dig in, and you certainly don't want them to pass that toxicity on to others—which they will.




That's the great lie: that there are *bad people.*

Try this: imagine what it would be like to turn that shielding knob up to its maximum.

Or: imagine giving someone a dehumanizing glare. Go out in public and do it.

Oh, you won't? Why not? Because it's **evil.**

That's right: evil people don't do a *different* thing than the rest of us; they just have a more complete version of the *same* thing.

By no means am I asking you to sympathize with them, or God forbid, be nice to them.
