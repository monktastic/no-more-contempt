# Chapter I: Contempt
## Conscience

Have you ever done something you knew was wrong at the time, but couldn't fully admit it to yourself until later? Maybe you made a cruel comment to boost your ego, took credit for someone else's work, or cheated on a test (or even partner).

While you were doing it, one part of you knew it was wrong, while another was busy producing justifications for why it wasn't "really" wrong.

Notice an asymmetry here: the part that *knew*—your conscience—wasn't trying to justify itself. It just... was. The part providing justifications wasn't trying to convince *it*; it was trying to convince you—that your conscience was just one more voice among the noise.

But it wasn't.

## Limbo

At some point, you realized you were fooling yourself—and yet this wasn't new information. Somehow you had *always* known, but convinced yourself you hadn't.

That knowledge—was it *unconscious*? Not really: it was always there for you to see if you'd looked. It was consciously accessible. You had just... kept your attention turned away.

It existed in a kind of "limbo state": a bizarre schism of mind in which we know something—*consciously*—and yet are **sure** we don't... until we retroactively discover that we always did.

It's a profound form of self-deception, but we don't do it because we're "bad people." We usually ignore our conscience as a form of protection, against a perceived hostile world.

What knowledge might you be keeping in limbo right now?

## Contempt and Integrity

Think back to a moment you felt contemptuously judged by another person. No matter how "right" they may have been; even if you *knew* you had done wrong, something felt *off* about them, didn't it? You could tell they weren't coming from a good place. How?

Now think of a time when someone set you straight with profound integrity—seemingly getting nothing out of it themselves. Even if it stung your ego; made you lose face, you had no desire to take revenge, did you? Why not? What could you tell they were serving?

Now turn it around.

Think of a time when *you* contemptuously judged someone. Even if you tried to hide your contempt, they still dug in their heels, didn't they? And somewhere inside, that resistance confirmed what you already believed.

And finally, a time when you corrected someone with integrity yourself. Perhaps you had to do it with more ferocity; more violence than in the previous case—and yet something in you knew it would ultimately bring *more* peace. *How* did you know?

---

That time you stood in integrity, and the time the person who corrected you did: even if you knew nothing else about them—their politics, their religion, their creed—didn't it feel like you were somehow serving the same thing? What is that?

And the time you stood in contempt, and were treated with contempt: didn't it feel like *those* were somehow serving the same thing? Not just your personal egos, either.

Integrity feels clean from both the inside and outside.

Contempt feels righteous inside but dark, dirty, insincere from the outside.

There's a reason for that distinction—and seeing it clearly changed everything for me.

## How Contempt Works

When I mock or shame my enemies and they dig in, I have a mixed response. On the surface, I feel dismayed: *damn, my enemies really are as bad as I feared.* But underneath, there's a feeling of vindication: *see, my enemies really are as bad as I feared!*

Did I expect to be vindicated going into it? Of course not! That would make me a bad person.

And yet, if you're on the receiving end, you somehow feel it anyway, don't you? That I'm secretly trying to prove myself right about you, even as I claim to be helping?

Of *course* some part of me wanted it—but I was focused on all the ways it would help. So it wasn't really unconscious; I just didn't notice it.

The desire to make you a worse person to prove myself right—that's pretty obviously malicious when spelled out, right? And we know from experience that contempt almost never makes things better.

So I was ignoring the part of me that knew it was malicious, in favor of ideas about all the good it would do. What does that sound like to you?

More importantly: how did *you* recognize that disconnect when I myself didn't?

---

Have you ever been on the receiving end of a dehumanizing gaze? Can you sense how the person felt somehow "turned away" from themselves? Malice practically emanates from that state, right?

And contempt is dehumanizing, isn't it? I'm seeing you as *fundamentally defective*; subhuman. I can't really do this to you without turning away from my better nature—and that's what you're feeling.

If I had the capacity to be fully present and honest in that moment, of course I would notice it. It was totally consciously accessible—I just didn't register its dark quality, because I was so sure it was going to help.

There's a kind of "ends justify the means" feel to it. My mind is filled with stories of how it's for the greater good, which drown out the warning bells going off inside. They also change how the dehumanization feels: It magically becomes *righteous.*

And look what that invites you to do. Doesn’t it license you to turn away, too? After all, if the world is this deceitful, you'd be foolish to be the lone chump following your better nature. 

It feels like I'm moralizing you while refusing to hold myself to the same standard—and that hypocrisy naturally provokes the reaction: _fuck your rules._

---

So some part of me wanted you to dig in, and I maintained a state that would pretty much inevitably cause it—and both halves were conscious, albeit hidden from me.

Does that sound like a coincidence to you?

And it doesn't end with just one step, does it? It's not like I'm going to treat you with *less* contempt next time, right? And what about the time after that? I see you as *increasingly* evil.

There's a part of me that wants nothing more than to violently punish evil, and I'm slowly nudging you toward being the kind of person who can only be dealt with in that way—despite there being a way that wouldn't cause this.

Obviously I have a moral responsibility to fight evil. But what exactly does the contempt add, other than making you see *me* as evil, nudging us both ever-closer to Armageddon?

---

Nothing. The answer is nothing—well, except for that delicious hit of self-righteousness.

Anything I do to fight bad behavior—telling them firmly to stop, physically restraining them, whatever—is made *worse* by adding contempt. But I don't notice this in the moment.

It feels like it's helping *somehow*. I'm rubbing their noses in how *bad* they are. Maybe that will help them finally get it and change their ways! And if they don't, well, that just proves how bad they are!

Or maybe by flashing them my own darkness, I'll show them what I'm really capable of—frighten them into stopping. So my darkness isn't *real* darkness; just the strategic kind!

Meanwhile, part of my mind can literally see: this is only going to make things worse.

I'm literally harming someone by telling myself stories of how righteous it is. That delicious hit of self-righteousness? It's just my thirty pieces of silver.

---

Let's recap.

There's a part of my mind that lures me away from my conscience with rationalizations—turning me away from myself / my better nature. And while falling for this trap, I appear (from the outside) to be in pretty much the same state—if a milder version—as genuinely evil people.

In this state, I license myself to cause harm—and it feels fucking delicious.

Not because I'm a *bad person*—oh, no—but because it's good when I do it.

You see, I'm the special exception. This is definitely not what evil people are feeling when *they* do it.

---

Look, obviously you're not Hitler.

But the mechanism that enables you to harm your enemies while feeling good about it—is it not possible that this is *exactly* the mechanism that the "bad people" are lost in?

And treating them with contempt—would this not shove them deeper *into* that trap?

## The Parasite

This dark part of me that lures me away from my better nature, and then reveals itself to you—while hiding itself from me—so that I can push you deeper into the same mistake, while blaming it on you...

Would I really want it if I saw clearly what it was doing? Obviously not.

And look how I feel afterward. I see you as even more irredeemably evil. My world looks darker. Which means I'm even more likely to give this part of myself control in the future.

So there's something hiding itself from my mind to stay alive, and then coming out at opportune moments to do its dirty deed—which is to create more fertile conditions for itself to survive.

It is a parasite, and I am its host.

Forget about the metaphysics for a moment—whether this is a "real thing" with its own agenda. Is it not an eerily precise description of an impossibly dark and fiendishly clever pattern?

And when I see "evil" in you—might I not be looking at exactly this same thing in *your* mind?

Obviously the details of yours differ. The justifications it uses on you are custom-tailored to your psyche, and the way you act it out may be different. But isn't the result the same—a world more fit for this thing to survive, and *less* fit for humanity?

That person who corrected you with fierce integrity: did it feel like they were reminding you of something in yourself that you had temporarily forgotten? A sense of: *this isn't you?*

And the same way you can't argue with your own conscience—didn't it feel like you couldn't really argue with them? That any justifications would fall flat? Almost like they were an external manifestation of something in you—something deeper than your parasite.

There *is* something that fights the darkness—and it can do so fiercely; even violently. The crucial distinction is: it never mistakes the person for their parasite. And this one "little" change makes *all* the difference in the world.

## The Hitler Objection

Maybe you're thinking "fine, maybe this works for most people—but some people really *are* fundamentally irredeemable."

But the truth is, you can't ever really know, can you—whether there's some tiny spark still in there?

And yet there is one thing you can know, through direct experience: any time you view someone that way, you *will* find darkness at the helm. You may not recognize it at the time, but look.

The *only* reason I ever believe this about someone is that some part of me knows I can sneak something dirty in. Usually there's some agenda of my own that I secretly suspect is self-serving, and "proving" this person irredeemable suddenly renders it justified.

Was Hitler "irredeemable" in the sense that there's absolutely no reason for me to waste my time trying to "redeem" him? Yeah, I'd definitely shoot him.

But there's a kind of... ontological, fundamental, inherent, etc. irredeemability that's different from the functional kind. And when I see people that way—even if I don't realize I am—that's contempt.

And if I shoot Hitler with contempt—with *bloodlust*—it feels different to you, doesn't it?

In one case, I'm serving justice in the only way I know how, and not taking violent pleasure in it. In the other, I'm feeding *your* bloodlust.

You may *think* that bloodlust can somehow stay contained to Hitler, or to Nazis, or maybe just to your political enemies... who are basically Nazis, anyway...

---

It's incredible how subtle contempt can be and still accomplish its job.

For example, nobody has probably ever thought of their partner as "ontologically morally defective"—and yet, during an argument, it's common to feel a twinge of "what's wrong with you?" That's contempt—and it's the leading predictor of divorce, for good reason.

When I skirt my conscience—say, shaving off a little extra for myself somewhere—I'm showing a kind of contempt for humanity; putting myself above others. And in a culture where that's normalized, doesn't it invite people to disobey their consciences more generally?
