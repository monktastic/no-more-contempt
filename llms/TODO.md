**The ending is slightly weak**: The questions are good, but there's no buildup of the "this is completely obvious" part that the guidance emphasizes. You go straight to "Why is nobody talking about this?" without first establishing how utterly obvious it is. The guidance says: > "This isn't some subtle insight. This isn't advanced psychology. Every single person knows what contempt feels like to receive..." You have this, but it needs to hit harder before the "why is nobody talking about this?" question.
