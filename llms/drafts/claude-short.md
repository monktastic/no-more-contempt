# The Perfect Crime (Short Version)

> _For so long as the root of wickedness is hidden, it is strong. But when it is recognized, it is dissolved. When it is revealed, it perishes. ... It is powerful because we have not recognized it._ — The Gospel of Philip

Once, on a heroic dose of psilocybin, I was shown something that shattered my understanding of good and evil. Two decades later, I'm still reeling from the consequences.

What I saw wasn't just about psychology. It was about the fundamental mechanism of evil itself—and most disturbingly, how it uses _our own goodness_ as its primary transmission vector.

I saw how some of civilization's core assumptions—that hating bad people is good; that reality is composed of fundamentally inert matter; that rational thought is our only reliable guide—were themselves vectors of the very darkness we claim to oppose.

If you find yourself thinking "wait, how does that follow?"—that's fair. The [full version] provides the complete mechanism, the evidence, and the reasoning. This is just the trailer._

## The Perfect Crime

Think back to a time when you skirted your conscience. In that moment, part of you knew _perfectly well_ you were doing wrong, but you shielded that knowledge from conscious awareness so it didn't _feel_ wrong. Knowledge of your wrongdoing existed in a limbo state—you simultaneously _knew_ and yet somehow _didn't._

This is the secret behind all the evil there ever was.

Now bring to mind someone whose actions genuinely horrify you. Can you feel that edge where your desire for justice crosses into something darker? An urge not just to stop them, but to see them _suffer_?

I was shown that while this urge felt like authentic goodness, it was actually _feeding_ the darkness I claimed to oppose. Here's how:

When you look at someone with contempt—perceiving them as _fundamentally defective_—you're sending a precise message through countless subtle channels: your tone, microexpressions, the way you hold yourself. You're saying: "We all see that you're lost. I'll pretend to lead you home while secretly driving you further from it."

They receive this perfectly. And they respond by digging deeper into the very behavior you claim to oppose, which then proves you were right about them. It's the perfect self-fulfilling prophecy.

## The Mechanism

Here's the mechanism: you and I both know we're not intrinsically superior to others. _They_ know we know. We know _they_ know we know. Ad infinitum. This is what's called common knowledge in logic and game theory.

So when we pretend superiority and punish on that basis, it's common knowledge that this is profoundly hypocritical and will only reinforce their darkness. Which we can then blame them for. Which they _also_ know we know. Forever.

This is contempt's secret handshake. It's how our darkness coordinates with theirs while making each of us feel righteous.

## The Scale

But here's where it gets terrifying: this isn't just individual psychology. Every person engaged in self-deception is participating in what behaves like a distributed intelligence—a network coordinating our mutual destruction while each of us feels like we're fighting evil.

Look around. The United States headed toward civil war, both sides convinced the other is evil incarnate. Families fracturing. Communities splitting into hostile camps. This pattern is accelerating _right now,_ driving us toward catastrophe while everyone feels justified.

The pattern doesn't need a conspiracy in some smoke-filled room. It has billions of humans unconsciously coordinating, all convinced they're fighting darkness while spreading it. The Christians call it the Devil. The Buddhists call it the ego. And whether it's a metaphysical entity or an emergent property doesn't matter—what matters is it behaves with such consistency and intelligence that modeling it this way is essential to opposing it.

And here's the kicker: that urge to _violently fight_ the conspiracy "out there"—that righteous fury—only ever originates _from_ the pattern itself. It's not evidence you're free. It's evidence you're deep in its grip.

## The Deepest Contempt

It is impossible to communicate just how subtle our contempt can be while still accomplishing its dark mission.

**Simply by _perceiving reality as an intrinsically lifeless collection of "stuff"_, we unwittingly reinforce every system of exploitation on Earth:**

- Corporations plundering nature (just resources)
- Factory farms brutalizing creatures (just meat machines)
- Prisons dehumanizing inmates (defective units)
- Wars enriching the powerful (acceptable losses)
- Ecosystem destruction (collateral damage)

All flows from seeing the world as dead matter. **When you perceive reality as lifeless, you don't need active malice to participate in its destruction. The contempt is baked into the perception itself.**

This worldview—the one we consider enlightened, rational, scientific—may be the pattern's most brilliant achievement. It doesn't _feel_ like darkness. It feels like clear-eyed realism.

**The accelerating collapse of our biosphere isn't a side effect of human intelligence. It's the inevitable result of intelligence captured by this darkness—this systematic blindness to the aliveness of everything.**

## The Way Out

There's a way out, but not the way you think.

When you actually see this pattern—really see it operating in yourself—something extraordinary happens. You realize the darkness was never _you_. It was an infection. Something that learned to think your thoughts so convincingly you mistook it for yourself.

> _The road to hell is paved with good intentions._ —Proverb

More precisely: the road to hell is paved with good _conscious_ intentions that mask our true deepest intentions—the ones that actually shape reality through our tone, our microexpressions, the subtle ways we relate to others.

What you actually are is something else entirely: a fierce, radiant, infinite Love that excludes nothing and forsakes no one—including the targets of its fearsome wrath when necessary.

This Love is not soft. It is not naive. It can be violent if required. Its only defining characteristic is that it's utterly free of self-deception. It doesn't misperceive evil as intrinsic to any mind. It targets the pattern, not the person.

This seemingly subtle shift changes everything. When you're operating from contempt, you're trying to destroy the host. When you're operating from fierce compassion, you're addressing the Light in them that's been colonized, bypassing their defenses in a way contempt never can.

## Anger vs. Contempt

**Anger** wants the behavior to stop. **Contempt** wants the person to suffer.

**Clean outrage** demands accountability. **Contemptuous outrage** demands humiliation.

Contempt often doesn't feel like contempt. It masquerades as "just being realistic" or "calling out bad behavior." The tell: do you perceive them as _fundamentally different_ from you? That subtle sense of "I could never do what they do"?

That's contempt—even when it feels reasonable.

## What's at Stake

Reality itself is structured around this principle: consciousness can either remember what it is or forget what it is. Every moment, you're nudging the whole toward remembering or forgetting. There is no neutral.

Your innermost intentions weave themselves into reality through channels both measurable (emotional contagion, microexpressions) and perhaps subtler ones we don't yet understand. Even choices no one will ever see reverberate through what unfolds next.

## You Can Be the Anchor

Here's what makes this feel less overwhelming: you don't need everyone to wake up. You just need enough people refusing to feed the pattern.

Think of it like herd immunity for consciousness. When you're the one person in a contempt spiral who doesn't participate—who stays curious instead of defensive, who refuses to match contempt with contempt—you change the entire field. You give everyone else permission to step back from the edge.

You don't need to fix humanity. You just need to be one anchor in your corner of reality. The pattern spreads through emotional contagion, but so does refusing to feed it. Fierce compassion is contagious too.

Start today. That conversation later. That person who irritates you. That political opponent you're tempted to mock. That's your opportunity to be the anchor that shifts the field.

## The Shift

Right now, reading this, something in you is already shifting. You can't look at contempt the same way anymore. The pattern is losing its grip.

This is not abstract philosophy. This is about the choices you'll make today.

Will you shove them deeper into darkness while feeling righteous about it? Or will you see the pattern operating in both of you and refuse to feed it?

There is no war between good and evil people. There never was.

There is only the eternal war between consciousness remembering what it is and consciousness forgetting what it is.

And you are consciousness in the process of remembering.

Welcome home.
