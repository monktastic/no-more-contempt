# The Pattern: How Evil Hijacks Our Goodness

> _For so long as the root of wickedness is hidden, it is strong. But when it is recognized, it is dissolved. When it is revealed, it perishes. ... It is powerful because we have not recognized it._ — The Gospel of Philip

---

## Prelude

Once, on a "heroic dose" of psilocybin, I was shown something that shattered my understanding of good and evil. It wasn't a gentle insight—it was a cascading series of revelations, each more horrifying than the last, that demolished my entire worldview and replaced it with something infinitely more mysterious and meaningful.

Two decades later, I'm still reeling from the consequences.

What I saw wasn't just about psychology or morality. It was about the fundamental architecture of evil itself—how it operates, how it spreads, and most disturbingly, how it uses _our own goodness_ as its primary transmission vector. By the end of that night, I understood why every major wisdom tradition has warned about the same thing: there is something that hijacks human consciousness, and its most brilliant trick is convincing us it doesn't exist.

I saw how civilization's core assumptions—that contempt for bad people is good; that reality is fundamentally dead matter; that rational thought is our only reliable guide—are themselves vectors of the darkness we claim to oppose.

What follows is an attempt to show you what I saw—and why it matters more urgently than almost anything else we could be paying attention to right now.

Throughout this essay, I'll refer to this coordinated system of self-deception as both "the pattern" and "the darkness." Use whichever helps you see it more clearly.

A word about audience: if you need peer-reviewed studies before considering that consciousness might work differently than materialist assumptions suggest, this essay probably isn't for you—at least not yet. But if you've sensed something like this yourself, or if the way we collectively relate to "evil people" has started to feel deeply wrong in ways you can't quite articulate, then read on.

> _The earth is not dying, it is being killed, and those who are killing it have names and addresses._ —Utah Phillips

Can you feel it—how there are *evil people* out there, gleefully laying waste to everything in sight for their own temporary enrichment? How could we not hate them for that?

But here's a difficult question: wouldn't some tiny part of you be disappointed to discover they're not *fundamentally* evil—that they're just badly confused and inherently redeemable? Wouldn't some small part of you feel robbed of the right to deliver that righteous vengeance they so richly deserve?

Here's what I was shown: as much as I wanted to deny the existence of that part of me, it was driving far more of my behavior than I could have imagined. I *needed* to know that some people were simply evil—and as a result, I behaved in ways that subtly provoked them into confirming it.

In other words, I was creating the very evil I hated, just to give myself the pleasure of valiantly defeating it. But why would I do that? I'm a *good guy,* I thought.

I discovered that some part of me had always known I was doing this, but had hidden it from myself—and yet this didn't stop others from sensing it. They could detect my hidden darkness, and this is what provoked them into embracing theirs.

But most shockingly of all, part of me knew that, too—that revealing my darkness would secretly invite theirs. I'll say it again: not provoke it, but *invite* it. It's as if my darkness was *empowering* theirs while pretending to fight it—as though the two were in cahoots.

What I saw next destroyed everything I thought I knew about good and evil.

The legendary battle between good and evil is *real*, but it doesn't take the form that the storybooks tell us—an valiant fight between the pure-hearted and the wicked. It takes place in every mind and every interaction; in every single choice we make and every action.

The darkness is hiding in plain sight, where we least expect it: our own minds. What follows is my attempt to show you what I saw about how to expose it.

# Part I: The Mechanism

## The Limbo State

Think back to a time when you skirted your conscience—acted against your own deepest values while pretending it was okay. In that moment, part of you knew _perfectly well_ that you were doing wrong, but you shielded that knowledge from conscious awareness, so that it didn't _feel_ wrong. All you could hear were your own clever justifications. Knowledge of your wrongdoing existed in a kind of limbo state, in which you simultaneously _knew_ and yet somehow _didn't._

But why do we have to hide it? What are we hiding it _from_, exactly? It's almost as if there's a deeper part of us—call it our inner Light—that wouldn't tolerate it, if only it knew.

But what about "evil people"? Do they need to engage in similar self-deception to do what *they* do? It sure doesn't seem like it—after all, there's no Light there to hide anything *from.* Their misbehavior seems to be of a fundamentally different nature from ours—or so we tell ourselves...

---

## Mockery

Let's start with a less extreme example.

Think back to a time when you mocked someone for their beliefs. You may have told yourself it was for the greater good—that it would shut them up, or make them realize how *bad* they are.

But if you're honest, part of you *wanted* them to double down, so that your mockery would be justified.

And they probably did—but crucially, only because you embedded a hidden signal within it, conveying roughly: *you are fundamentally defective.* This made them perceive *you* as slightly evil, which they felt a natural urge to resist. It made them see the world as slightly darker; caused them to lose faith in humanity—reinforcing their need to self-deceive for protection.

But here's the thing: the only way you could push a fellow human deeper into the abyss was by entering the limbo state yourself—the very origin of evil. This means they weren't entirely wrong in their perception of you. But if you had allowed yourself to recognize this, it would have destroyed your own self-image—so you hid it from yourself.

It's almost as if your mockery was a way to flash the dark part of you to them, strengthening that same capacity in their mind. Can you feel that?

---
## From Mockery to Contempt

Mockery is relatively tame. We know we're nudging another person away from their Light, but it's mild enough that we can still consciously admit what really happened.

But beyond a certain point, our enemies seem... evil. It seems clear they have no such Light, and believing they do would be dangerously naive. So when our cruelty causes them to entrench, we see it totally differently. It serves as more proof that they *have* no Light.

Bring to mind someone you consider genuinely *evil.* Can you imagine giving them a cold stare meant to convey that fact? It feels *righteous*—as if you're letting them know their evil won't be tolerated.

But that's *not* what you're telling them. You're communicating that *they themselves* are inherently defective—fundamentally unworthy of love, or really anything but pain.

You're probably not thinking this thought consciously. It's more like a vague sense of moral superiority. A background hum that says "I'm made of better stuff" or "they're just... different." But the darkness of the message gets through all the same.

Deep down, we *know* this distinction. We know there's a way of opposing evil—fiercely, even violently; of *hating their behavior* without forsaking *them*. We know this is likely to result in a much healthier outcome. But we also know that these two forms of opposition can be made to look nearly identical from the outside.

Which means we know that nobody could blame us for picking the "wrong one."

---

## The Hidden Knowledge

Not only can nobody *else* blame us if we make the wrong choice; we will not even blame ourselves.

We *know* the two forms of opposition send different signals, and we *know* which is which. But we also know we can make them look similar enough on the surface that we can pretend—*even to ourselves*—that we don't see the difference.

This is the mechanism by which we can knowingly shove people deeper into darkness while *genuinely believing* we were offering them a way out.

Psychologists call this the Fundamental Attribution Error: *we judge ourselves by our intentions and others by their behavior.* We see our contempt as righteous opposition—after all, we *mean* well—while their contempt proves their evil nature.

And once you see this clearly, you realize something even more horrifying.

---

## All The Evil There Ever Was

This mechanism isn't unique to contempt or mockery. It's the secret engine behind *every harmful act in history.*

The CEO knowingly polluting rivers, the politician starting wars on false pretenses, the billionaire hoarding wealth while people starve—they all operate through precisely this mechanism. Part of them knows. Always. The knowledge exists in limbo. They could choose to examine it. But they generate justifications: "Everyone does it." "It's for the greater good."

The CEO who ignores environmental harm tells themselves they're just doing their job. The politician who lies tells themselves everyone lies. The citizen who looks away tells themselves they're just one person.

Everyone has good reasons. Everyone is just responding to the world as it is.

Think about the Nazi who convinced himself Jews weren't really human. The knowledge that they *were* human existed in limbo. He could have examined it. He chose not to.

**This mechanism—and only this mechanism—is what enables every atrocity.** Not monsters. Not people fundamentally different from you. Just humans who've learned to hide knowledge from themselves while appearing righteous.

And here's what broke me wide open: *I was using the exact same mechanism.*

Which raised the most disturbing question of all...

---

## The Hidden Motive

But why on Earth would we want to do that?

It's so that we can continue to believe that all the problems of the world are caused by something fundamentally alien to us—the result of *inherently defective* people whom we could never hope to understand, let alone help. Sure, we may commit little misdeeds here or there, but they're of a fundamentally different nature than the *real* darkness that plagues our world.

To put it bluntly: we subtly but continually reinforce the evil "out there" to hide our own from ourselves. That is why we fail to defeat the evil in the world. Part of our minds is actively working against this goal.

Their evil is *not* of a different nature. The subconscious message we deliver to "bad people" is made of **exactly** the same "stuff" that enables their misbehavior. Not only do they know this, but we know this, and we know they know this—which is why we know it will work. We are revealing our darkness because we know how they will receive it: as license to embrace theirs.

This creates a vicious spiral: We make others more evil so that we can hide our own darkness from ourselves. But the very act of making them more evil *requires* us to hide our own darkness from ourselves. You can't push someone deeper into self-deception without entering that state yourself. 

**In other words, contempt for evil people doesn't just fail to help—it IS the darkness it claims to fight.**

And as we shall soon see, these parts of our minds are not working independently. They're coordinating in ways that will seem impossible until you see them directly.

## The Medicine Journey

On that trip, the medicine showed me specific times I'd radiated contempt at people I considered evil, convinced I was righteously opposing them.

And this time, I couldn't hide from what was in limbo.

### I Was Making Them Worse

When I mocked or shamed these people, they didn't change. They dug in their heels. Got more extreme. More defensive.

I'd always told myself: "Well, that's because they're fundamentally defective."

But then the floor dropped out.

**I saw that I was trying to make them worse.** Not accidentally. *Actively trying.* Part of me wanted them to double down, to become more evil—because then I could feel even more self-righteous fury, the most intoxicating feeling in existence.

I was taken back to specific moments, and shown exactly where in my mind this knowledge had existed.

### I Wanted This Outcome

But why would I want to make them worse?

I saw that part of me desperately *wanted* them to make the wrong choice. Because there was nothing more viscerally satisfying than watching evil be violently punished. And that satisfaction felt *righteous.* It felt like proof I was good.

The surface story: *I'm giving them one final chance to repent.*

But underneath? I *needed* them to fail. Because that proof would license me to unleash my darkness on them while calling it justice.

### I Engineered It

And then the medicine showed me something even more horrifying.

This part of me couldn't just leave their response to chance. It needed to *ensure* they would make the wrong choice.

The solution was brilliant in its cruelty: I would pretend to offer them a genuine path back while secretly sealing off all the exits. I would make my "olive branch" and my "poisoned olive branch" look almost identical—so identical that even my own conscious mind couldn't tell the difference.

I could craft a message that would reliably trigger their worst impulses while giving me complete plausible deniability.

*"Sorry, I was only trying to help!"*

The shove was accomplished by merely telegraphing my intention to execute it—knowing they would receive the signal, knowing they would react, knowing I could claim ignorance.

My overt behavior appeared to be righteously combating their evil. But underneath, I was conveying:

*"I don't care if you really do have something good buried under unthinkable pain. I'm going to smother it so thoroughly that nobody ever thinks to ask whether you have it."*

It's a path that starts with mockery, with the back of our minds already harboring the idea of pushing them all the way to complete moral condemnation.

### We Share The Same Mechanism

And then I saw something that broke me completely.

To shove them deeper into plausible deniability, I had to enter it myself. To push them into the limbo state, I had to enter that exact same state.

They can only cause harm by using this mechanism—hiding knowledge, generating rationalizations, choosing not to look. And to push *them* deeper into it, I had to use that identical mechanism.

We're both hiding from the same thing. Both using the same trick. Both capable of the same self-deception.

### I Could Always See Their Light

*"And what else?"* the medicine nudged, relentless.

I saw that underneath their darkness—underneath all that self-deception and rationalization and harm—was something pure. Something confused. Something *reachable*.

I had always been able to perceive this. Not as a belief—as direct perception.

But then I noticed something else. Something eerie.

The darkness itself—the thing covering their Light—I had seen it before. Not something similar. The *same* thing. Like recognizing someone's eyes across a crowded room. The same presence I'd encountered in others. The same presence I'd encountered in myself.

*This isn't something you're realizing now. It's something you've always known.*

The veil was lifted retroactively. I *had* always seen it.

Pure Light. Whose true nature is Love. Incapable of genuinely wishing harm.

The actual message I'd been conveying was:

*"We both know I can see your Light—that your evil is a distorted cry for help. We both know I could lead you back toward it. But no one can prove I knew that—not even me—so no one will blame me when I snuff it out."*

This wasn't just dark. It was pure malevolence—the very essence of evil.

I wasn't making a fundamentally defective person worse. I was knowingly shoving fundamentally innocent beings—badly confused people, identical to myself at the very deepest level—deeper into the abyss.

### The Liberation

And the moment you see it clearly—the moment this knowledge floods from limbo into full consciousness—something shifts at a fundamental level.

It feels very much like being freed from a demonic possession.

What I'd thought was "me"—the hatred, the contempt, the urge to crush evil—was actually a structure of self-deception masquerading as my identity. A parasite that had learned to think my thoughts and feel my feelings so convincingly that I'd mistaken it for myself.

**"Oh—this is not me."**

All those depictions of the angel and devil on our shoulders were almost right. Except the angel isn't some external guide—it's your true nature, what you actually *are*. And the devil isn't an equal opposing force—it's a parasite that can be evicted. They're not peers locked in eternal struggle.

The battle between good and evil is not symmetrical. The devil doesn't just whisper obviously-evil ideas in your ear—it speaks using your own voice, your own reasoning, your own sense of righteousness. The further you drift from your Light, the more easily you confuse the devil's voice for your own.

And then came the second revelation:

**"Oh—this is not them either."**

The people I'd hated, the ones I'd judged as fundamentally defective—they were in the same situation. The darkness couldn't possibly be their true self. It's a distortion, an infection, a forgetting.

The message was clear: *This is how it is possible for someone whose true nature is infinite Love—YOU—to commit great evil. This is exactly the same way they do it.*

Then the medicine showed me one more thing—what this looks like from the other side.

It let me experience progressively drifting away from the Light, becoming increasingly confused, trusting more and more in the voice of darkness while mistaking it for my own wisdom. The parasite becoming so familiar it feels like home.

From this vantage point, I could see how people responded to me. When I was closer to my Light, people loved me—they saw something genuine. But as I drifted further, more and more people began to look at me with contempt, with that same cold judgment I had once directed at others.

I understood why. They were doing exactly what I had done—mistaking my darkness for my essence, feeling righteous about condemning it.

But a tiny handful of people never changed. Throughout the entire journey into darkness, their eyes conveyed something different. They opposed what I was doing—fiercely, without compromise. They would stop me, restrain me if necessary. But through it all, they never forsook *me* to the enemy of the Light.

They weren't just refusing to let me misbehave. They were refusing to let the darkness claim another soul.

It was the Light itself acting through them—pure compassion in action. Not soft, not permissive, but absolutely unwilling to confuse the host with the infection.

When you witness one person refuse to give up on another, even as that person seems to descend into evil, something shifts in you. Your faith in humanity is restored, if only for a moment. Part of your own darkness evaporates, because you've been reminded that the Light is real, that it never abandons anyone.

# Part II: The Conspiracy

What I've shown you so far is the mechanism—how evil operates in individuals. But there's something even more disturbing: the way these individual mechanisms coordinate with each other.

> *Ultimately evil is done not so much by evil people, but by good people who do not know themselves and who do not probe deeply.* — Reinhold Niebuhr

## Why We Fetishize Rationality

> *When I've asked shamans about the sickness of the west, they say: "it's quite simple: you have severed your connection with spirit… unless you reconnect with spirit and do so soon, you're going to bring the whole house of cards down around your heads and ours."* — Graham Hancock

Our culture fetishizes rationality precisely because it's fundamentally incapable of detecting the spreading infection until _after_ it has physically manifested, by which point it is too late. We trust our thinking minds to tell us when they're lying to us, and then use more thoughts to prove that thinking is all we have.

The pattern convinces us that conscious reasoning is the only valid way of knowing, which allows it to operate beneath our awareness, hidden in limbo. We dismiss the part of us that could actually detect when we're being self-serving as "just feelings" or "woo-woo intuition."

Consider: You mock your political enemy online. Your rational mind generates justifications: "They need to be held accountable. Public shame enforces social norms." These sound reasonable. But there's a deeper faculty in you that *directly perceives* you're increasing the total darkness in the world.

The knowledge is right there, in what you dismiss as "gut feeling." But you've learned to disregard it because you can't articulate *why* you know it. You didn't know *how* you knew it would increase darkness—so you convinced yourself you didn't know it at all.

This is the perfect trap. Your contempt might even create temporary good—suppress their public misbehavior for a while. You point to this as evidence you were right. But meanwhile, you've pushed them deeper into self-deception and spread the infection to everyone watching.

**You cannot calculate your way to goodness.** Rationality is essential—we need rigorous thinking to navigate complexity. But rationality only serves us when it remains in right relationship with our deeper knowing. And the uncomfortable truth is that it's almost always been hijacked. We use our brilliance to justify what we already wanted to do, generating airtight logic for choices that our deeper knowing recognizes as harmful.

This is why we can prove *beyond any doubt* that an agenda is good, marshal all the evidence, convince brilliant minds, and still watch it wreak havoc. The most noble-sounding agenda can lead to catastrophe precisely because it's rooted in self-deception. When the damage is done—often after we've profited—we look back and say: *How were we supposed to know?*

But we *could* have known. If only we'd looked at what we were hiding from ourselves instead of trusting our calculations.

---

## The Secret Alliance

> *Darkness cannot drive out darkness, only light can do that. Hate cannot drive out hate, only love can do that.* — Martin Luther King, Jr.

All of our self-deceptions coordinate with each other.

When you project contempt at someone, your darkness and theirs recognize each other. On the surface you're enemies, but underneath, you're *helping each other* maintain your delusions.

You give them evidence they're being persecuted by self-righteous hypocrites. They give you evidence they're irredeemable. Both of you get to avoid examining your own darkness while feeling noble about fighting the other's.

The pattern spreads: you reinforce their darkness, they reinforce yours, your respective tribes see this and feel more justified. Each person creating exactly the conditions that justify their behavior. Everyone's self-deceptions coordinating perfectly, as if following a script none of you wrote.

This is the secret handshake—your darkness and theirs, coordinating beneath conscious awareness.

It doesn't feel like a foreign entity; it feels like _you._ Yet at the very deepest level, nobody could possibly want it. The more deeply it has ensnared their minds, the less able they are to recognize it.

---

## The Escalating Pattern

This secret coordination doesn't just maintain the status quo—it actively drives humanity toward catastrophe.

The pattern continually pushes us toward Armageddon: situations where everyone is violently proving how _righteous_ they are. It's why family dinners explode into bitter arguments. Why online spaces become tribal war zones where nuance dies. Why the US is headed toward civil war without anyone suspecting their own complicity. Why bitter [divorces](https://www.gottman.com/blog/this-one-thing-is-the-biggest-predictor-of-divorce/) happen where each side feels like the exclusive victim and hero.

Each escalation feels completely justified. Each side has mountains of evidence they're the reasonable ones, the defenders, the ones who tried everything else first.

The darkness doesn't care _who_ we hate, as long as we hate. The effect is always the same: to foment a constant atmosphere of contempt, providing exactly the cover it needs to remain hidden.

---

## We Need Bad People

**We desperately need bad people to exist.**

Think about what would happen if the "bad people" actually disappeared. Where would all your disowned darkness go? Who would carry the shadow you refuse to see in yourself?

The darkness doesn't disappear when you refuse to look at it. It has to go *somewhere.* And we unconsciously arrange to put it in other people—through the precise mechanism of contempt.

Bring to mind someone whose behavior genuinely horrifies you. Now imagine you hear credible evidence they've genuinely changed. Recognized their errors. Made amends.

Feel the resistance? The skepticism? The slight *disappointment*?

That's the tell. Think about it even more starkly: if you were given the choice between your enemy completely reforming—genuinely joining the Light—or being eternally punished for their sins, which would a dark part of you prefer?

Because hating them is how you know you're good. Judging them is how you prove you're better. Fighting them is how you avoid fighting the darkness in yourself.

As long as we feel like "good people," we believe in the existence of inherently "bad people," which justifies us harboring contempt somewhere in our minds. This is how the darkness keeps its foot in the door.

---

## The Common Knowledge

Here's where the technical part comes in, and where the true horror becomes visible.

You know you're not intrinsically superior to anyone. You know it at the deepest level. Not as belief—as direct knowledge.

And crucially: *they know you know.* And you know *they* know you know. Ad infinitum.

This isn't mystical. It's what's called "common knowledge" in logic and game theory. Some knowledge becomes shared in such a way that we all know that we all know it—recursively, all the way down.

When you hold someone in contempt—perceiving them as fundamentally defective—you're violating something you both know, in ways that you know you're violating it. You're pretending to an authority you don't have.

Think about a specific interaction: You're in a meeting, and someone says something you consider stupid. You respond with a particular tone, a certain facial expression, maybe a carefully-worded criticism. On the surface, you're just disagreeing. But embedded in all those signals is a message: "I'm intrinsically better than you." 

You know this message is there. You know they'll receive it. You know they know you know. But you also know you can maintain plausible deniability. And you know they can't call it out without sounding defensive. This entire transaction happens in seconds. Both of you perfectly aware of what's really happening. Both pretending you're not.

Your contempt doesn't just say "your behavior is wrong." It says "I'm intrinsically better than you, and we both know that's a lie, and we both know that I know it's a lie, but I'm going to act on it anyway—and hide that I'm hiding that I'm hiding it."

**This is why contempt lands so deep.** It's not threatening them at the level of behavior or even character. It's threatening something at the very foundation of their being—their sense that consciousness recognizes consciousness, that we're all in this together at the deepest level.

And when you threaten them at that level, something looks back at you through their eyes. You've seen it before. That flash of contempt returned. That presence. Not just in them—you've encountered it in others. In yourself. 

Always the same recognition.

This is why "bad people" can detect our contempt with uncanny precision, even when we're trying to hide it. This is why they spot our self-righteousness from a mile away. This is why our attempts to shame them into changing backfire so spectacularly.

And here's the thing: we know that they'll know. We know our contempt will be detected. We know it will provoke exactly the response we claim to be trying to prevent.

But this raises a deeper question...

---

## Why This Is Possible

Why should this kind of precise, mutual knowing even be possible? How can two people, even strangers, share such intricate knowledge so effortlessly—knowledge that operates beneath conscious awareness yet lands with perfect accuracy?

The answer points to something that will sound mystical but explains everything we've observed:

At the deepest level, your mind and theirs aren't truly separate.

The limbo state is where we forget what we are. Common knowledge works because we're not actually separate—your deepest knowing and theirs aren't in different minds. The pattern coordinates across billions of people because it's fragmenting one consciousness against itself.

Everyone is this same Light—not similar, but the same Light, looking out through different eyes, obscured by different patterns. One consciousness, temporarily forgetting itself so thoroughly it can feel contempt for itself wearing a different face.

This is why your innermost intentions weave themselves into reality through those subtle channels. This is why even choices no one will see reverberate through what unfolds. 

Every act of integrity, every decision to choose Love even when no one is looking, doesn't cease to matter. It reverberates through the Whole, invisibly mending the torn fabric of our collective psyche; healing the wounds that would otherwise serve as infiltration points for the darkness. Each such act makes our shared reality less hospitable for evil to thrive—but its most profound effect is one of silent solidarity. **Your private integrity invisibly bolsters the resolve of strangers halfway across the world just at the moment they are about to break, lending them the strength to hold the line when they feel they can no longer do so alone.**

Everything you do makes a difference. Because at the deepest level, there's only one consciousness here, choosing in each moment to remember or forget what it is.

And if we're fragmenting one consciousness against itself... what does that make the thing coordinating our forgetting?

---

## The Real Conspiracy

You've encountered it before.

That darkness in someone's eyes when they're consumed by contempt. That presence looking back at you. You tried to look away, but something in you recognized it.

Every time you've seen it—whether in the CEO casually poisoning a river, the troll delighting in cruelty, your family member twisted by tribal hatred, or that moment you glimpsed it in your own reflection—you weren't looking at different darknesses that happened to behave similarly.

**You were looking at the same thing, wearing different faces.**

Not the same "kind" of thing. The *same* thing. One darkness. One intelligence. Operating through billions of people simultaneously. Coordinating beneath conscious awareness.

And it's been using you too. Every time you felt righteous fury at "evil people," every time you were certain you were fighting it—it was operating through you. Using your goodness as its weapon. Getting you to spread it while you believed you were fighting it.

This is what the Christians call the Devil, what the Buddhists call the ego. You can treat it as metaphor if you need to—a useful model for understanding coordinated human behavior. But it's also as real as anything you can touch.

It is why some believe in an evil global conspiracy pulling strings from behind the scenes. They're not wrong—they've sensed something real. But it's not the conspiracy they imagine. It's the *primordial* conspiracy. The one to which all the rest owe their existence.

On the surface, you and your enemies may be at war. But underneath? Your darkness and theirs are allied. This is how it spreads nearly unchecked—getting each of us to strengthen it while flawlessly convinced we're fighting it.

**The feeling of being the noble one fighting the evil conspiracy IS the conspiracy.**

When you're actually opposing it, it doesn't feel like righteous battle. It feels like profound love. Like rescuing people—including yourself—from something that has everyone trapped.

That righteous fury? That sense of being the hero battling evil? That's not your Light. That's the pattern using your Light's energy while wearing its mask.

When you're actually operating from your Light, it feels completely different. More like grief than glory. More like heartbreak than heroism.

---

## The Worldview Contempt

But the pattern operates at an even deeper level than contempt for specific people. Our contempt for "bad people" may be the most visible symptom of a far more fundamental infection—one that shapes how we relate to reality itself.

**Simply by perceiving reality as an intrinsically lifeless collection of "stuff" over which humanity has dominion, we unwittingly reinforce every system of exploitation and destruction on Earth.**

Think about it: if you truly believed that forests were alive in some meaningful sense—not metaphorically but actually—could you clearcut them without entering the same limbo state we've been discussing? If you felt animals as conscious beings with inner lives as real as your own, could you run factory farms without hiding knowledge from yourself?

Our entire modern worldview—the one we consider enlightened, rational, scientific—rests on a foundational contempt so deep we don't even recognize it as contempt. We see the world as dead matter. Resources to extract. Objects to manipulate. A mechanical universe of purposeless atoms following meaningless laws.

And once you see the world this way—once you see forests as timber, animals as meat, rivers as waste disposal, even other humans as NPCs in your story—every atrocity becomes possible.

This worldview permits corporations to plunder nature for profit. It permits factory farms to brutalize helpless creatures. It permits prisons to dehumanize inmates in ways that guarantee recidivism. It permits governments to send our young off to wars that only enrich the pockets of the rich. It permits the shareholder meeting where an ancient forest is reduced to a line item, where someone literally says "the numbers make sense" about erasing a living system millions of years old.

The reason we're killing the biosphere is that the people who are okay cutting down forests don't see the life in them in the same way we don't see theirs. But here's the thing: we don't see the life in things either. When we treat the Earth as something to use and discard—when we sever ourselves from the recognition that we're violating something unspeakably sacred, something that gave us life—we're enacting the exact same contempt we direct at "evil people."

The devastation we see in the world is literally a mirror image of the sickness within. **The collapse of the biosphere IS our self-deception externalized.**

Once you genuinely see this—once you see how the pattern of contempt extends from individual relationships all the way to our relationship with reality itself—you can't unsee it.

## The Darkest Idea

> *If only it were all so simple! If only there were evil people somewhere insidiously committing evil deeds, and it were necessary only to separate them from the rest of us and destroy them. But the line dividing good and evil cuts through the heart of every human being.* — Alexander Solzhenitsyn

The darkest idea of all is that if we were to round up all the "bad people" and exterminate them, the rest of us would live in harmony.

The very self-deception required to harbor this thought guarantees that the darkness would remain behind, in full force; changing only its shape.

The very desire to divide the world into the fundamentally good and bad is how our darkness keeps its foot in the door, biding its time, waiting for the right conditions, so that it may manifest as full-blown evil.

This is the root cause of every atrocity that has ever been committed.

Every genocide begins with the perpetrators seeing their victims as fundamentally other. As less than human. As objects to be eliminated rather than beings to be recognized. The Nazis saw Jews as "vermin." During Rwanda, Tutsis were "cockroaches." This dehumanization isn't just rhetoric—it's psychologically *necessary*. Without it, the perpetrators couldn't do what they do. They need to perceive their victims as dead matter to be disposed of, not living beings to be acknowledged.

Perhaps paradoxically, the only way to be sure you'd never do such a thing is that you don't feel contempt for the people who have.

It is only by seeing how thoroughly we—the "good people"—have been tricked that we begin to appreciate just how terrifyingly clever the darkness is, just how deeply the "bad people" are trapped, and our profound responsibility in "saving" them.

So how do we break free?

# Part III: Breaking Free

## How to Expose Darkness

Here's something crucial about how this essay works—about how any real transformation works:

We try to expose people's darkness violently, through contempt and shame. We think we're rubbing their noses in it, forcing them to see. But that approach only drives the darkness deeper.

The way that actually works is compassionately—though not necessarily nicely. 

The medicine journey I described was fierce and unrelenting. It didn't let me hide from anything. It showed me that I was actively making people worse, that I wanted them to fail, that I engineered their descent—each revelation more horrifying than the last. But here's what made it transformative rather than traumatic: every exposure of my darkness was held within an unwavering recognition of my Light. 

The medicine never said "you're a terrible person." It said "look at what's happening in you"—and simultaneously—"look at what you actually are underneath it." It showed me I wasn't the parasite. It showed me the parasite wasn't intrinsic to who I am.

**This essay is attempting to do the same thing for you.**

To show you the pattern operating in yourself—which may feel uncomfortable, even devastating—while never letting you forget that this pattern isn't what you are. That your Light is primordial and indestructible. That the very fact you're able to see the pattern means you're not fully identified with it.

If you're feeling that discomfort right now, that resistance, that urge to close the essay—good. That's the pattern sensing it's been recognized. Stay with it. The discomfort isn't punishment; it's the feeling of the trap losing its grip.

When you expose darkness this way—fiercely but with love, relentlessly but with recognition of the Light—it can actually be seen and released. When you expose it with contempt, it just digs in deeper, because contempt says "this darkness is what you are" and the whole being rises up to defend itself.

This is the difference between true compassion and cruelty wearing compassion's mask.

## Fierce Compassion

There's a way to oppose evil that doesn't feed the pattern.

Anger is a completely natural response to harmful behavior. But it's almost always accompanied by malice, contempt, or self-righteousness. These may feel healthy, but they are manifestations of the parasite.

You can be absolutely enraged at someone's behavior while still seeing their Light. You can oppose them with every fiber of your being while refusing to forsake the consciousness looking out through their eyes.

This is fierce compassion. When you act from it, you never lose sight of what you're actually doing. You never mistake violence for righteousness. You never forget you're acting out of tragic necessity, not noble crusade.

Compassion has nothing to do with being nice, or gentle, or tolerant, or even understanding. Compassion can be fierce, or even violent, as the situation warrants. But its profound integrity prevents others from using our darkness as an excuse to cozy up to theirs. 

When you operate from contempt, you're trying to destroy the host, convinced that the pattern and host are one. Your enemy feels this through a thousand subtle cues. Their own pattern recognizes yours and uses it as justification.

But when you're operating from genuine compassion—when you see through the illusion that evil is intrinsic to their mind—something different happens. Your actions become infused with a different intention, and that intention transmits through all those same subtle channels.

You're no longer whispering "you are the darkness." You're saying "I see that you've been colonized by this pattern, and I will not collude with it by pretending it's who you really are."

This bypasses their defenses in a way that contempt never can. The part of them underneath the pattern suddenly finds itself being addressed directly. Something in them recognizes something in you. Their faith in humanity, which may have been buried under years of bitterness and self-protection, stirs. And for a moment, the real war becomes visible: not between the two of you, but between both of you and humanity's true enemy.

You may remain surface enemies. You may still need to fight them, stop them, even harm them if they're causing harm to others. But underneath, something has shifted. The pattern can no longer use your interaction to strengthen itself.

Being free of self-deception doesn't automatically mean you'll know what behavior is best. You still need to develop wisdom—to learn what is helpful and harmful in different situations. Compassion must be paired with wisdom to be truly effective.

And it actually *is* dangerously naive to pretend that an evil person has Light when you can't genuinely see it. They will use your pretense against you. That's why it's crucial to learn to *actually* see it—to perceive both the Light and the accumulated darkness covering it. That authentic perception is what inoculates us.

Make no mistake: executing this well can require great skill, commensurate with the depth of their infection. The deeper it goes, the more they feel like it _is_ them, and thus the harder it is to evict. Simply pretending or assuming that they're fundamentally good can certainly backfire. But the more clearly you perceive your _own_ inner Light, the less you have to pretend with others. The more directly you are able to cut through their delusion, without falling into the fatal trap of allowing their darkness to unknowingly provoke your own.

You simply cannot fathom the full extent of pain and distortion that the Light must undergo to become "evil." Your heart would break a billion times over, and then a billion more. By the time a person becomes someone who apparently chooses evil, an unthinkable amount of horror has already ravaged their mindstream. 

None of this suggests we should feel *sympathy* for them, because by this point, softness would make things worse. But if you really saw it all, you could never again feel that malicious urge to shove them deeper into the abyss. You would immediately recognize it as the very essence of evil. 

At the very ultimate level, there is nothing special about any one of us that would have ensured we would turn out differently. Seeing this, one truly understands "there but for the grace of God go I."

## The Trap of Fake Compassion

> *And no wonder, for even Satan masquerades as an angel of light.* — 2 Corinthians 11:14

Genuine compassion can be fierce. Contempt always pretends to be compassion.

The pattern knows people are catching on to overt hatred. So it disguises itself.

"I'm just trying to help them see..."
"This is for their own good..."
"I'm holding them accountable..."

Check what's in limbo when you say these things.

Is there even a trace of:
- Satisfaction in seeing them suffer?
- Enjoyment of your moral superiority?
- Hope they'll respond badly so you can escalate?

**If yes, it's contempt masquerading as compassion.**

Think about the person at a community meeting who loudly demands someone be removed, making a show of their moral outrage. The overt message is about protecting the community, but underneath there's often something else: a performance of goodness designed to hide one's own darkness—not just from others, but from oneself.

Psychologists call this moral self-licensing: when we do overtly "good" things, we give ourselves permission to do selfish things. But the reverse may be more true: much of the showy "good" we do is to hide the subconscious recognition of our darker behavior.

The test is simple: Can you see their Light while opposing their behavior?

If you can genuinely see they're a fundamentally redeemable being trapped in confusion, and you're acting to free them, then it's compassion.

If you secretly see them as fundamentally defective and you're acting to prove it or make them suffer, then it's contempt.

They can tell the difference. Even if you can't.

Contempt is an _unloving_ way of exposing the truth. It feels like coercion, not invitation. To preserve dignity, they run into denial, which means deeper darkness.

When we contemptuously judge our enemies, it may feel like we're rubbing their noses in their _badness_ so that they will be forced to confront it (and then when they don't, we assume it's because they're bad), but we're actually trying to make it harder to confront.

---

## There Is Only One War

Reality itself—this entire universe—*is* structured around this principle of one consciousness choosing to remember or forget what it is. Not metaphorically. Actually.

Evil is nothing but this forgetting taken to its ultimate conclusion. Good is nothing but the remembering.

And every action you've ever taken has nudged the whole either toward remembering or forgetting. There is no neutral. Every choice reverberates.

**There is no war between good and evil people. There never was.**

There is only the eternal war between consciousness remembering what it is and consciousness forgetting what it is.

The very definition of good is that which brings us all closer to remembering our common true nature, and that can only be done by remembering yours. Evil is the opposite of this. That is why it is often said that the greatest gift you can give to the world is your own Awakening. Until then, some part of you will always be reinforcing evil, even as another part is confident that you're fighting it. It is completely inevitable.

At the very deepest level, you _are_ the Light. So is everybody else. In fact, you _are_ everybody and everything else, just pretending that you're not. One consciousness, dreaming countless perspectives.

What you ultimately are is a Light so vast that it defies description; a profound Love for all of reality that excludes nothing and forsakes no-one—including the targets of its fearsome wrath, should that be necessary.

Realizing this in its entirety is known as _enlightenment_, but all of us can sense it to some degree or another at all times. It is only by turning away from this ultimate truth that we are able to feel contempt, and thereby willingly cause harm.

A major punchline: goodness is simply what remains in the absence of self-deception, not something you have to add. (The classic angel and devil on shoulders is almost correct, but the angel is actually your true nature and the devil is your capacity for self-deception—a parasite that can be evicted. They are not equals.)

Notice how the word "right" is a synonym for both "good" and "correct." This is not an accident: something in you knows that what is good is what is most correct.

*(For those interested in exploring this idea further, see the Addendum for examples of how various thinkers and traditions have pointed to this same recognition.)*

## The Accountability Paradox

Before you dismiss this as excusing accountability—understand carefully:

This recognition doesn't erase responsibility—it *magnifies* it.

If we're all one consciousness:
- The harm done by "the other" is harm done to what you most deeply are
- The imperative to stop it becomes *absolute*
- There is no one else to pass the buck to

This is why fierce compassion exists. Why the Dalai Lama says if someone's trying to shoot you and you have a gun, shoot back—but never out of malice.

The difference is: when you act from this understanding, you never lose sight of what you're actually doing. You never mistake violence for righteousness, and this makes all the difference in the world—even if there's no logical reason it should.

The shift in mindset: we are rescuing people (badly confused versions of ourselves?) from our primordial nemesis.

---

## Be An Anchor

You don't need to fix everyone. You just need to be one anchor in your corner of reality.

Think of it like herd immunity for consciousness. You don't need *everyone* to wake up. You need enough people refusing to feed the pattern.

When you're the one person in a contempt spiral who doesn't participate—who stays clear-seeing instead of defensive, who refuses to match contempt with contempt—**you change the entire field.**

The pattern spreads through emotional contagion, through unconscious mimicry, through millions of small permissions we give each other to close our hearts.

**But the opposite is also true.**

Staying true to your Light is contagious. Refusing contempt is contagious. Fierce compassion is contagious.

You don't need to be enlightened. You just need to be one person who's awake to the pattern in your actual life, refusing to feed it when the temptation arises.

Just like the darkness can handshake with itself in others, our Light can, too. When we're compassionate with evil people—even fiercely, violently—it's as though our Light is reminding theirs that it has a partner in the fight against our shared nemesis. We can still do this while fighting the human.

If we only learn to see this one thing, we will understand the secret mechanism behind _all the evil there ever was_—and we will finally be effective in ending it, instead of mindlessly perpetuating it. Your enemy is infected by a mind-virus that lives within you, too. Heal yourself, and you will automatically learn how to heal them. This is what you most deeply desire, whether you know it yet or not. It is the _only_ path toward healing our broken world.

---

## Concrete Practices

Here are ways to refuse to feed the pattern:

- **In gossip sessions:** Don't pile on. Speak to the person's humanity.
- **In meetings:** Address someone's better nature. Assume confusion rather than malice.
- **On social media:** Disagree sharply without adding contempt.
- **In traffic:** Assume that driver is confused, exhausted, rushing to an emergency.
- **In family conflict:** Hold space for everyone's pain without making anyone wrong for having it.
- **With "bad people":** Oppose their behavior without forgetting their Light. Be willing to harm if necessary, but never with contempt.

If you have some grand narrative about how to save the world, it's crucial to check whether it's causing (or even requiring!) you to have contempt for what's right here, right now. If so, it probably isn't rooted in authentic goodness, and probably won't have the effect you think (or can even prove!) it will. 

Common examples: "I'll hoard as much wealth and resources as possible so that I can one day deploy it in service of good" (see: FTX). Or eugenics projects. How genuinely compassionate intent can lead to harm: we love animals, become vegan and then judge everyone who's not. Or we love trees and become ecoterrorists.

## The 24-Hour Challenge

In the next 24 hours, catch yourself doing this thing. Just once.

Someone will say something stupid online. Notice the urge to mock. Check what's in limbo—see what's really there.

Someone will criticize you. Notice the defensive reaction. Check what's in limbo—what are you hiding from?

You'll think about someone you despise. Notice the satisfaction in hating them. Check what's in limbo—do you need them to stay evil?

**Just catch it once.**

Because once you see the pattern operating in yourself—really see it, not as abstraction but as something alive in your actual experience—you can't fully unsee it.

And that's when the real work becomes possible.

---

## The Ironic Trap

Here's a trap I fall into constantly: judging people who express contempt.

You read this essay, you recognize the pattern, and suddenly you start noticing it everywhere. That person being contemptuous online—don't they see what they're doing?

And there it is. Contempt for people who have contempt. The pattern using your understanding of the pattern to perpetuate itself.

When you notice contempt in others, check: am I feeling superior to them right now? Am I enjoying catching them in their darkness? That's the pattern.

The recognition that someone else is trapped doesn't make you better than them. It makes you responsible for not adding to their burden by shoving them deeper in.

Ironically, the only people who _are_ superior—and thus have any right to feel contempt—are those who have seen through this most insidious trap, and are therefore incapable of feeling genuine contempt.

---

## The Work Required

Reading this essay and "getting it" intellectually is not the same as being free of the pattern. Not even close.

There are layers upon layers. You'll catch yourself being contemptuous and think "ah, I see it!" Then weeks later you'll realize that even that recognition was laced with subtle self-satisfaction. Then you'll catch that. Then you'll catch the catching.

This is why every wisdom tradition has practices. Shadow work to surface what you're hiding. Meditation to observe your mind. Psychedelics to dissolve the structures of self-deception. Therapy to work through the pain that makes you want to look away.

What is required is ongoing honesty—a willingness to keep looking even when it's uncomfortable.

The pattern is ancient and clever. You'll still fall for it. The difference is that now you have the ability to recognize it, and that recognition—repeated over and over, deepening over time—is what actually changes things.

This isn't a one-time insight. It's a lifelong practice.

---

## The Shift

Something in you has already shifted by reading this.

You've brought knowledge from limbo into full consciousness.

The next time you feel that urge to crush someone's soul while calling it justice, some part of you will pause. Some part of you will remember.

**The trap has lost some of its power over you.**

You'll still fall for it sometimes. But now you have the ability to recognize it.

And a pattern that can be seen can be broken.

---

## You Are Consciousness Remembering

Right now, reading this, feeling this—you are consciousness in the process of remembering what it is.

Not learning something new. Remembering something primordial.

The pain is ancient—generations upon generations of forgetting, of separation, of violence done in darkness. But the Light underneath? That's primordial. That's what you actually are, what you've always been, what you can never stop being no matter how deeply you forget.

The knowledge was always there, hidden in limbo, in everyone's minds. We've all always known we're one consciousness temporarily forgetting itself.

Every time you've felt that deep connection with another being—even one you don't know, even one you "should" hate—that was you remembering.

Every time you've felt that ache when you see suffering—*anyone's* suffering—that was you remembering.

Every time you've caught yourself being cruel and felt that sinking sensation—that was you remembering.

The knowledge has always been there. We've just been choosing not to look.

We are all intimately connected in a way that transcends all attempts to describe it. We have relegated this truth to the "spiritual," where we can safely lock it away—because we know that if we opened that box, we would be forced to confront our own profound complicity in the world's ills. Every act of conscience-skirting and every unkindness we have ever perpetrated on _anyone_ still remains "out there," waiting patiently for us to clean it up. The atrocities we see halfway across the globe are not disconnected from us, like we imagine; nor are they excuses to pump even _more_ darkness in the world in the form of contempt for their perpetrators.

On the contrary, every bit of darkness we see in the world is an invitation for us to clean up the darkness in ourselves. This is completely counterintuitive, which is why it's so hard to figure out—but when we finally do, something astonishing happens. We begin to perceive the _reasons_ that other people are unable to give up their own darkness; and rather than make the horrifying mistake of shoving them deeper into the abyss for it, we start to sense our role in pulling them _out_ of it.

---

## Welcome Home

There is only one war:

Between consciousness remembering what it is and consciousness forgetting what it is.

Between choosing to look at what's in limbo and choosing to look away.

Between spreading the infection and spreading the cure.

And you—reading this right now—are part of the cure.

Not because you're better than others. Not because you've figured it all out. Not because you won't mess up again.

But because you've seen the pattern. And you've chosen to look rather than look away.

That choice—repeated moment by moment, day by day, interaction by interaction—is how the world changes.

Not through some grand movement or perfect ideology. Through enough people refusing to feed the Beast, one moment at a time, in their actual lives.

You can start today. This conversation you'll have later. That person who irritates you. That political opponent you're tempted to mock. That's your opportunity. That's where you can be the anchor that changes the field.

**The veil is lifting exponentially as more anchors appear.**

You can be that anchor. Right now. In your life. Today.

Can you feel it? Right now, in this moment? The recognition dawning.

Something in you has already shifted. You can't look at contempt the same way anymore.

The pattern has already lost its hold on you, whether you fully realize it yet or not.

You've seen it. Now you get to choose—in every interaction, every moment of righteous fury, every time you're tempted to see someone as fundamentally defective—feed it or starve it.

The choice has always been yours. You just didn't know you were making it.

Now you do.

## Addendum: Resonances and Resources

If the idea that we're all one consciousness temporarily forgetting itself resonates with you, you're not alone. Throughout history, mystics, philosophers, and even scientists have pointed to this same recognition. Here are a few expressions that might help deepen your understanding:

**[The Egg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fcK_fRYaI)** - A short story by Andy Weir (author of The Martian), beautifully animated by Kurzgesagt. A simple parable about what it might mean if we're all the same consciousness experiencing itself from different perspectives.

**[Please Call Me By My True Names](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fcK_fRYaI)** - A poem by Thích Nhất Hạnh that explores the interconnectedness of all beings, including both perpetrators and victims of harm.

**Brad Warner on Non-Separation** - From his book *[Hardcore Zen](https://www.amazon.com/Hardcore-Zen-Monster-Movies-Reality/dp/1614293163)*, this Zen priest (and punk rocker) describes his direct experience of oneness:

> Even if I want to put this realization down I can't. Sometimes it's excruciating. You know those morons that rammed those planes into the World Trade Center? That was me. The people that died in the collapse. Me again. Every single person who ever paid money for a Pet Rock? Me. I don't mean I identify with them or sympathize with them. I mean I _am_ them. It's impossible to explain any more clearly than that, but this isn't a figure of speech or bad poetry. I mean it absolutely literally.
>
> But the universe is sooooo much bigger than any of that. The sky is me, and the stars too, and the chirping crickets and the songs they make; sparkling rivers, snow and rain, distant solar systems and whatever beings may live there: it's all me. And it's you, too.

**Why We Feel Moved by Acts of Kindness** - Have you ever felt deeply touched when someone helps a stranger, even though it doesn't directly benefit you? This is our recognition of oneness leaking through. We thank people for charitable acts that don't affect us because we can sense, at some level, that whatever happens to the world ultimately happens to us. When someone restores another person's faith in humanity, they're restoring ours too.

*"For so long as the root of wickedness is hidden, it is strong. But when it is recognized, it is dissolved. When it is revealed, it perishes."* —The Gospel of Philip
