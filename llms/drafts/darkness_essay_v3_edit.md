# All The Darkness We Cannot See

There's a darkness descending over our world. You can feel it in the casual and shocking disregard for life—for each other; for other creatures; for nature as a whole. There's a nagging sense that despite our best efforts, things are somehow getting worse.

We tell ourselves it's because of *them*—the bad people, the evil ones. But what if the real source is something we've never suspected? What if it lives within our own minds, hiding in the last place we'd ever think to look?

> *If only it were all so simple! If only there were evil people somewhere insidiously committing evil deeds, and it were necessary only to separate them from the rest of us and destroy them. But the line dividing good and evil cuts through the heart of every human being. And who is willing to destroy a piece of his own heart?* —Alexander Solzhenitsyn

---

Let me start with a story.

I took a large dose of psilocybin and reality came apart. What happened wasn't gentle insight—it was systematic demolition of my entire worldview. A cascading series of revelations, each one more sickening than the last, destroying everything I thought I knew about good and evil.

It began with me being shown how much I enjoyed mocking and shaming my enemies. The rush of it. The satisfaction. This seemed normal enough—who doesn't enjoy seeing bad people get "owned?"

Then the floor dropped out.

**I saw that I was *trying to make them worse*.**

Not *accidentally* making them worse while trying to help, but actively. Part of me wanted them to dig in their heels, to double down, to become more evil; because then I could feel even more self-righteous fury—the most intoxicating feeling of all.

But how did I accomplish it? How can you reliably make someone worse?

---

Think back to a time when you skirted your conscience—acted against your deepest values while pretending it was okay. In that moment, part of you knew *perfectly well* that you were doing wrong, but you shielded that knowledge from conscious awareness, so that it didn't *feel* wrong. All you could hear were your own clever justifications. Knowledge of your wrongdoing existed in a kind of limbo state, in which you simultaneously *knew* and yet somehow *didn't.*

Something in you knows that this is the same reason *other* people do wrong, too—that even the worst person can only cause harm by shielding themselves from perceiving the *life* in their victims; lest they recognize themselves in those eyes—but you hide this knowledge from yourself in exactly the same way.







---

This state of self-deception has enabled *all the evil there ever was.* Even the worst person can only cause harm by using this same trick to shield themselves from perceiving the life in their victims—that spark that reminds them of themselves. If they *didn't* hide it, they couldn't do it, which suggests there may be a deeper part of them—their inner Light—that doesn't want to.

This mechanism is very difficult to recognize in ourselves, but very easy to see in our enemies. And this asymmetry—this is where things get interesting.

Let me start with a story.

---
## I. The Demolition


And I had accomplished this through contempt. Not overt cruelty—just the subtle sense that they were *fundamentally defective*. Something in me wanted them to become worse people so that I could be right about them.

Then came the revelation that shattered me completely: I had always been able to see beneath their justifications, to the part that exists prior to them—the Light hidden under their delusion. The aspect literally incapable of genuine malice.

Which meant that what I had been doing—gleefully, repeatedly, with utter conviction in my righteousness—was **deliberately smothering the Light in fundamentally innocent beings**.

And I had somehow *known* it, but hidden it from myself—so that I could call it "fighting evil."

---

## II. The Paradox of Shared Knowledge

But here's where it gets truly strange. *How* was I darkening other people's minds? 

If they'd been aware of it, they wouldn't have fallen for it—and if *I'd* been aware of it, I couldn't have done it. But how can one execute a plan they aren't even aware of? And what would such a plan even look like?

The answer to both questions lies in a paradox I was shown: **We all know what's really happening.**

Not only do we know we're not intrinsically superior to anyone; they *know* we know; and we *know* they know we know; ad infinitum. This is called *common knowledge*, in a [precise technical sense](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_knowledge_(logic)).

It is therefore also common knowledge that *pretending* to be superior—and using this as an excuse to punish them—is profoundly hypocritical, and will only reinforce their darkness; which we can then blame them for—which they *also* know. Etc.

So when we harbor contempt for anyone, we're sending a multi-layered, malicious signal that says: *I can see your inner Light but am choosing to smother it in the name of Good—and I'll get away with it, because there's no evidence I'm doing anything wrong. But we both know it.*

It is pure malevolence.

*This* is why my enemies dug in their heels when I mocked, shamed, and contemptuously judged them. It's not the behaviors themselves that caused it, but this malevolent taunt that I secretly injected into them; a taunt that nobody—not even myself—could prove I injected.

Meanwhile, my rational mind was telling me: they dug in their heels not because I encouraged them to, but because, well, they're defective. Therefore, my behavior didn't create *new* evil, but merely exposed the evil already there—a genuine service to the world. 

I was therefore not only free, but morally compelled, to escalate. This increased not only their capacity for self-deception, but my own as well.

---
## III. How Self-Deception Spreads

Part of me knew this would increase the "net darkness" in the world, but it couldn't say *how* it knew—and so I pretended that it didn't. Meanwhile, my rational mind justified itself clearly, making it the obvious one to trust. I *knew* this was a mistake, but thought that if I just buried this knowledge deeply enough, it couldn't possibly have any impact on the world.

But ironically, the self-deception required to do so was itself visible to others, thereby ensuring that it would darken the world. But since I couldn't fathom how this happened, I could only blame it on them. I did my best—and I could prove it!

**The darkness always leaks.**

While we're busy convincing ourselves, it's as if our darkness is telegraphing itself to our enemy, whispering: *See? Even the so-called good people are ultimately frauds, abandoning their supposed "Light" the second it became convenient. This Light must be only a myth. I am the true source of power in this world, and we both know it—so let's all stop pretending.*

This is how nearly all evil in the world spreads. We subconsciously recognize when other people act against their conscience, and it licenses us to do the same, justifying it as the only way to survive in this dark world. And anyway, our own sins are minor compared to theirs—so why worry about ours? There are bigger fish to fry.

But most of the damage doesn't come from the act itself; it comes from our demonstration that the Light is weak. This subconsciously spreads to others, who we then viciously judge, in a perpetual feedback loop that we never recognize our own involvement in. We think we must fight even harder.

---
## IV. The Mechanism Revealed

Let me be specific about how this works, because it's both simpler and more devastating than you might think.

When you mock someone—even internally, even in ways you'd never express—you're not just observing their darkness. You're *coordinating* with it. 

In that moment of contempt, something impossible happens: infinite layers of mutual knowing, despite both of you hiding things from yourselves. How is this possible?

Here's what I experienced, and I offer it not as proven metaphysics but as one explanation that makes sense of the phenomenon: At some level, we're not as separate as we appear. The "common knowledge" is only possible because we are, in a sense, One. We're somehow observing ourselves through different sets of eyes. It is *this* knowledge that the darkness is trying to hide—or rather, that we're trying to hide from ourselves.

You don't have to believe this. But you can test its implications:

**Every time we're unkind to anyone—every act of contempt, every moment of self-righteousness—we're demonstrating that darkness is the way.** Not through our words, but through the self-deception required to feel good about our cruelty. Others sense this self-deception, even when we cannot. It licenses them to engage in theirs.

The darkness that exists in them exists within us too, even if it feeds on different psychological motivations. Theirs may be about money or power, while ours is simply the need to feel like "good people." Yet no matter how seemingly-innocent our motivation, the net effect is the same. **By engaging in any form of self-deception, we induce the same tendency in others.** It is infectious.

---

## V. The Distributed Entity

This is where my experience became almost impossible to articulate in conventional terms.

I saw our individual darknesses behaving not as separate things in conflict, but as limbs of a single organism—my contempt triggering theirs, which triggered mine, in a feedback loop neither of us consciously intended but both of us subconsciously maintained. And I could see it spreading—my contempt poisoning my allies, their contempt spreading through their networks, rippling outward through society like a living network.

All of our self-deceptions together appeared to behave like a distributed malevolent entity, manipulating all of humanity from beneath our conscious thresholds. The Christians know it as the Devil, and the Buddhists call it the ego. 

> *And no wonder, for even Satan masquerades as an angel of light. So it is not strange that his ministers also masquerade as ministers of righteousness.* —2 Corinthians 11:14-16

> *For so long as the root of wickedness is hidden, it is strong. But when it is recognized, it is dissolved. When it is revealed, it perishes. ... It is powerful because we have not recognized it.* —The Gospel of Philip

You can treat this as metaphor if you prefer. But here's what's observable regardless of metaphysics: **There is a pattern of coordination across human minds that behaves intelligently enough to be worth treating as an entity.** It feeds on contempt. Thrives on self-righteousness. Grows stronger every time we feel certain we're intrinsically superior to others.

It keeps our attention fixated perpetually outward, on the evil "out there," to prevent us from looking closely enough "in here," at the one place where we can actually defeat it.

Every act of unkindness we have ever perpetrated on *anyone* has secretly been in its service—and part of us has always known this.

---

## VI. Why We Can't See It

The darkness makes you feel certain you don't have it.

Right now, you might be thinking: "Sure, maybe *some* people are that self-deceived, but I'm relatively aware of my patterns."

The key word is "relatively." How much are you still hiding? Are you *certain* it won't come out under the most trying of circumstances—exactly those cases that cause the most damage? The darkness lurks where you least expect it, convincing you it doesn't exist in *you.*

Or maybe: "This essay is just another framework claiming to transcend judgment while judging everyone."

That too. Turning this into a conceptual debate so you don't have to look at the actual patterns in your own behavior.

**The surest signs you're infected:**
- Feeling certain you're not
- Feeling righteous about your behavior  
- Enjoying others' suffering (even slightly)
- Believing your cruelty serves a greater good

I catch myself in these constantly. The difference now is I *know* what they are. I can feel contempt arising and recognize: "There it is again—the darkness disguising itself as righteousness."

---

## VII. What About Actual Evil?

There's an obvious objection: "But what about people who are genuinely, deeply harmful? People who've done unspeakable things? Surely *they're* fundamentally different?"

Here's what I saw: Even they—*especially* they—can only do what they do by hiding the truth from themselves.

This is why every genocide begins with dehumanization. The Nazis called Jews "vermin." During the Rwandan genocide, Tutsis were "cockroaches." It's not just rhetoric—it's *necessary*. Without this perceptual shield, the perpetrators couldn't do it.

> *If you hate a person, you hate something in him that is part of yourself. What isn't part of ourselves doesn't disturb us.* —Herman Hesse

Some people are so deeply trapped that "evil" captures something important about their state. Self-deception has burrowed so deep they've forgotten anything else exists. They've convinced themselves their darkness is their friend—a kind of Stockholm syndrome with their own infection.

You simply cannot fathom the full extent of pain and distortion that the Light must undergo in order to become "evil." Your heart would break a billion times over, and then a billion more. By the time a person becomes someone who apparently chooses evil, an unthinkable amount of horror has already ravaged their mindstream—layers upon layers of trauma, confusion, and self-protective forgetting, each one burying the memory of their fundamental nature a little deeper.

The hardest thing to explain about this ravaging is that it does not unfold in what we normally conceive of as linear time. In a profound sense, the separation from our nature is a choice being made in every moment—a kind of eternal moment, if you will.

**This is how we forget our Oneness.** Through accumulated pain that becomes too much to bear, we begin to see ourselves as separate, as alone, as fundamentally different from others. The forgetting isn't a choice—it's a survival mechanism that eventually becomes a prison.

And here's what we miss: **When we forsake others, we're really forsaking ourselves.** Their darkness reminds us of our own, which is too painful to bear. So we exile them, push them away, treat them as fundamentally other—because we're not ready to come home to our own wholeness yet. We're not ready to face what we've been hiding from in ourselves.

> *What bothers us about others, what we dislike or fear in them, are aspects of ourselves that they mirror back at us, aspects we dislike seeing.* —John Makransky

At the very ultimate level, there is nothing special about any one of us—no cleanliness of soul—that would have ensured we would turn out differently. Seeing this, one truly understands "there but for the grace of God go I."

But—and this distinction is *everything*—**perceiving their evil as intrinsic to them (rather than as an infection) is precisely how my darkness strengthens theirs.**

This doesn't mean being nice to them. Sometimes fierce opposition is necessary. Sometimes violence. But there's a world of difference between:

**"I'm fighting an evil person"**
vs.
**"I'm fighting to free someone from an evil that's captured them"**

The first comes from contempt and feeds the cycle.
The second comes from what I can only call compassion—though that word has been corrupted almost beyond recognition.

---

## VIII. What Compassion Actually Is

Compassion is not:
- Being nice
- Being gentle  
- Being understanding
- Being tolerant
- Letting people off the hook

Compassion can be fierce. Can be violent. Can look like mockery, shaming, or apparent contempt from the outside.

**The only distinguishing feature is internal: the complete absence of malice, contempt, or self-righteousness.**

If you can feel even a trace of these, you're under the spell, regardless of how justified it seems.

When you're genuinely free of contempt, *they can sense it*. Even if only subconsciously. Their darkness can't find the hook it needs to justify itself. The cycle of mutual provocation loses its grip.

But—I cannot emphasize this enough—**it is incredibly easy to fool yourself into thinking you're acting from compassion when you're actually acting from hidden contempt.**

"I'm not being cruel, I'm practicing fierce compassion!"

This is one of the darkness's favorite tricks. The safeguards:

- If you're *enjoying* their suffering, you've been fooled
- If you feel *righteous* about your behavior, you've been fooled
- If you're *certain* you're seeing clearly, be very suspicious

The safest path: err on the side of gentleness until you've done enough inner work that the difference becomes unmistakable in direct experience. And even then, hold it lightly.

---

## IX. The Only Mechanism

Here's what I saw about how harm actually occurs:

**The only way anyone can cause harm is by hiding from the recognition of life in others.**

We must shield ourselves from perceiving the *aliveness* in our victims—whether humans, animals, or nature itself. We must convince ourselves they're fundamentally separate, fundamentally other, fundamentally less.

This explains:
- How soldiers kill
- How factory farms exist
- How we destroy ecosystems  
- How we treat "bad people" with contempt

It's all the same mechanism. The same forgetting. The same othering.

And here's the connection that changed everything for me: **Perceiving the physical world as intrinsically lifeless—as mere dead "stuff"—is itself a form of contempt.**

Materialism isn't just a philosophical position. In my experience, it's a manifestation of the darkness. The ultimate othering—treating reality itself as dead matter to be exploited.

Every clearcut forest, every factory farm, every poisoned river flows from this one misperception. We can only plunder what we've convinced ourselves is not alive. Can only destroy what we've convinced ourselves is not us.

**The accelerating collapse of our biosphere isn't a side effect of human intelligence. It's the inevitable result of intelligence captured by this darkness—this systematic blindness to the aliveness of everything.**

---

## X. Why This Matters More Than Anything

We're running out of time—not just because of climate change, political collapse, or technological risk (though all those are real), but because:

**Nearly everything we're doing to "fight" these problems is feeding their root cause.**

Our contempt for "bad people"—the climate deniers, the corrupt politicians, the willfully ignorant—strengthens the very patterns destroying our world.

Our self-righteous fury at injustice, our certainty that we're the good guys, our conviction that some people are fundamentally broken—all of it feeds the Beast.

Think about it: we mock people who deny climate change, which makes them dig in harder, which makes us mock them more viciously, which makes them...

The same pattern plays out everywhere:
- Political polarization (each side certain the other is fundamentally defective)
- Social media outrage (everyone performing righteous fury)
- Culture wars (treating people as irredeemable)
- Criminal justice (punishing rather than healing)

We keep doing more of what doesn't work, convinced that this time, if we just fight hard enough, it will finally succeed.

> *Darkness cannot drive out darkness, only light can do that. Hate cannot drive out hate, only love can do that.* —Martin Luther King, Jr.

**It won't. It can't. Not until we stop fighting from within the infection.**

---

## XI. The Only Way Forward

The fight against evil must begin with devastating honesty about our own darkness.

Not just gentle self-reflection. Not acknowledging you "have some biases."

**Ruthless. Crushing. Honesty.**

This means catching yourself:
- Feeling contempt and recognizing it as darkness (not righteousness)
- Enjoying others' suffering (even slightly)  
- Feeling self-righteous about your behavior
- Hiding your true motivations from yourself
- Provoking the very behaviors you condemn
- Using others' evil to justify your own

When you see this clearly—really see it, not just intellectually acknowledge it—something shifts. It can feel like being freed from a demonic possession you never knew you had.

> *The shadow is a moral problem that challenges the whole ego-personality, for no one can become conscious of the shadow without considerable moral effort. To become conscious of it involves recognizing the dark aspects of the personality as present and real. This act is the essential condition for any kind of self-knowledge.* —Carl Jung

> *Such a man knows that whatever is wrong in the world is also in himself, and if he only learns to deal with his own shadow, he has done something real for the world. He has succeeded in shouldering at least an infinitesimal part of the gigantic, unsolved problems of our day.* —Carl Jung

You'll be confronted with every time you:
- Deliberately made someone worse while calling it good
- Took pleasure in their deterioration
- Convinced yourself your cruelty was noble  
- Fed the Beast while believing you were fighting it

This is devastating. I'm not being dramatic. It can crush you.

**And it's necessary.**

Because you can't fight what you can't see. And you can't see it while you're convinced you don't have it.

---

## XII. Practical Guidance

What helped me see this:
- **Psilocybin** (with proper support—this is where my own demolition happened)
- **Meditation** (learning to observe my mind without being my mind)
- **Radical honesty** (especially about times I justified cruelty)
- **Therapy** (surfacing motivations I'd hidden from myself)

But the core practice is simpler:

**Catch yourself in the lie.**

Notice when contempt arises. See it for what it is—not righteousness, but darkness. Watch how it makes you want to hurt someone while feeling good about it.

Don't suppress it (that just drives it underground).
Don't indulge it (that strengthens it).
Just *see* it clearly.

As you do this repeatedly, something shifts. You become unable to perceive others as fundamentally defective. You see them as trapped in patterns you're working to escape.

And your way of being changes—not because you're trying to be good, but because you can't unsee what you've seen.

---

## XIII. A Warning About This Framework

This framework can be weaponized:

"I'm not being cruel, I'm practicing fierce compassion!"
"If you think I'm contemptuous, that's your darkness talking!"
"I've transcended judgment—you're still trapped!"

If you catch yourself thinking *anything* like this, you've been captured.

The framework itself can become another tool of the darkness. Another way to feel superior. Another excuse to be cruel while feeling righteous.

**The only safeguard: radical honesty about your inner state.**

Are you enjoying their suffering? Darkness.
Feeling righteous? Darkness.
Certain you've figured it out? Darkness.

---

## XIV. What I'm Still Learning

I'm not writing this from having transcended the pattern. I still:
- Feel contempt and have to catch myself
- Get seduced by righteous anger  
- Convince myself my darkness is justified
- Forget what I glimpsed
- Feed the Beast while thinking I'm fighting it

But I've seen enough to know:
- Contempt for people (not just ideas) is *always* darkness
- Perceiving anyone as fundamentally defective is *always* a trap
- Unkindness *always* feeds the Beast  
- The fight must begin with myself

And when I manage to act from genuine clarity—however rare—something shifts. Conflicts transform. People respond differently. The cycle loses its grip.

It's subtle. Often imperceptible. But real.

My relationships are blossoming because I'm becoming genuinely more heart-centered. Not because I'm trying to be good, but because I can increasingly sense the cost of contempt—not just to others, but to the fabric of reality itself.

---

## XV. The Test

Try this: Watch yourself for one day. Just observe.

- Notice when contempt arises (that feeling of being intrinsically superior)
- See what happens when you mock someone (even internally)
- Observe how you provoke behaviors you then condemn
- Catch yourself hiding motivations from yourself  
- Find even a trace of enjoyment in others' suffering

If you find these patterns—and I suspect you will—then you're ready to ask the only question that matters:

**What would it mean to fight evil without feeding it?**

Not to stop fighting. Not to be nice to people causing harm.

But to fight without contempt. Without self-righteousness. Without the secret pleasure of watching them suffer.

To oppose harmful systems while recognizing the fundamental innocence buried beneath everyone's darkness.

To hold people fiercely accountable while seeing that you're fighting to free them, not destroy them.

I don't have complete answers. But I know it's the only fight worth having.

Because everything else—every strategy, every movement, every revolution—will be captured and used by the darkness if we haven't first learned to see it in ourselves.

---

## XVI. An Invitation

> *Be kind, for everyone you meet is fighting a great battle.* —Author unknown

I'm not asking you to believe the metaphysics. The stuff about unity and distributed entities might be true or might be one interpretation of certain experiences. I genuinely don't know.

But I am asking you to test the observable patterns:

Does contempt make people better or worse?
Does self-righteousness lead to good outcomes?
Do you ever catch yourself enjoying others' suffering?  
Have you ever hidden your true motivations from yourself?

If you're honest—really honest—you'll find what I found.

And then the only question is: what are you going to do about it?

Because you can't unsee it once you've seen it. You can try to forget, can let the darkness lull you back to sleep. But somewhere inside, you'll know.

You'll know that every act of contempt is a choice. That every moment of self-righteousness is you being used. That every time you feel certain you're better than others, the darkness has won another round.

**We're all in this together. All infected. All feeding the Beast while convinced we're fighting it.**

The only question is whether we're ready to see it.

---

**A final note:** If you're feeling defensive, dismissed, or angry reading this—just pause.

I'm not claiming to be better than you. This demolished me. I'm still being demolished by it.

But if you're experiencing a strong negative reaction, at least wonder: *why?*

What is that reaction protecting you from seeing?

The darkness hides most effectively by making us certain we don't have it. By turning away from self-examination. By focusing our attention on the evil "out there."

Don't let it win.

Look.

Just look.

What you find might save us all.
