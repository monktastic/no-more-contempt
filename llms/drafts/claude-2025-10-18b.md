# The Pattern: How Evil Hijacks Our Goodness

> _For so long as the root of wickedness is hidden, it is strong. But when it is recognized, it is dissolved. When it is revealed, it perishes. ... It is powerful because we have not recognized it._ — The Gospel of Philip

## Prelude

Once, on a "heroic dose" of psilocybin, I was shown something that shattered my understanding of good and evil. It wasn't a gentle insight—it was a cascading series of revelations, each more horrifying than the last, that demolished my entire worldview and replaced it with something infinitely more mysterious and meaningful.

Two decades later, I'm still reeling from the consequences.

What I saw wasn't just about psychology or morality. It was about the fundamental architecture of evil itself—how it operates, how it spreads, and most disturbingly, how it uses _our own goodness_ as its primary transmission vector. 

I saw something that every major wisdom tradition has warned about: there is something that hijacks human consciousness, and its most brilliant trick is convincing us it doesn't exist—or worse, that it only exists in _them_.

What follows is an attempt to show you what I saw—and why it matters more urgently than almost anything else we could be paying attention to right now.

Throughout this essay, I'll refer to this coordinated system of self-deception as both "the pattern" and "the darkness." Use whichever helps you see it more clearly.

> _The earth is not dying, it is being killed, and those who are killing it have names and addresses._ —Utah Phillips

Can you feel it—the *evil people* out there, gleefully laying waste to everything in sight for their own temporary enrichment?

How do they make you feel? What do you want *them* to feel? Be totally honest.

Would some tiny part of you be disappointed to discover they're not *fundamentally* evil—that they're just badly confused but inherently redeemable people like the rest of us? Would that part feel robbed of the right to deliver the righteous vengeance they so richly deserve?

What is that part of you trying to accomplish?

What is it *actually* accomplishing?

# Part I: The Mechanism

## The Limbo State

Think back to a time when you skirted your conscience—acted against your own deepest values while pretending it was okay. In that moment, part of you knew _perfectly well_ that you were doing wrong, but you shielded that knowledge from conscious awareness, so that it didn't _feel_ wrong. All you could hear were your own clever justifications. 

Knowledge of your wrongdoing existed in a kind of limbo state—a paradoxical state of mind, a bizarre schism, in which you simultaneously _knew_ and yet somehow _did not._

But why do we have to hide it? What are we hiding it _from_, exactly? It's almost as if there's a deeper part of us—call it our inner Light—that wouldn't tolerate it, if only it knew.

---

## Mockery, Shame, and the Signal

Think back to a time when you mocked or shamed an enemy. You probably felt you were doing it to help—if not them, exactly, then at least the world. But if you're honest, part of you secretly wanted them to dig in their heels, to prove themselves worthy of your contempt.

And they probably _did_—but not just because of what you said or did. It was because part of you was sending a hidden signal that said, roughly:

> You're *defective.*

But there's something even more fundamental being communicated. At its core, the message is:

> *I am nothing like you.*

This is the primordial signal from which all the others flow. "You're defective" and "you're irredeemably broken" are just flavors of this deeper claim: that there's a fundamental difference between us; that what you are is alien to what I am.

But why send this signal? What is it actually trying to accomplish?

Perhaps you're starting to sense how many layers of self-deception are operating here—and how our own willingness to engage in it secretly licenses others to do the same.

## The Medicine Journey

The mushrooms took me back to two very different confrontations.

In the first, I was confronted with someone I _knew_ was capable of change but was acting terribly. I knew better than to push them closer to the brink—so while I still opposed them with great force, part of me was subconsciously offering an olive branch that said:

> _You know what you're doing is wrong. I'm not going to let you do it, but you're always welcome back into the Light._

I could feel the fierce integrity of that message, and knew they could, too. It didn't fix things immediately, but a seed had been planted.

Then I was taken back to a different kind of moment—one where I was certain my enemy was beyond redemption. There was no other explanation for their behavior.

On the surface, my message was the same: _I will stop you._ I'd assumed I was acting with the same integrity.

But the medicine began to reveal hidden layers of deception.

That same signal from before—*you're defective*—was there, but now it had hardened into something more absolute: *you're FUNDAMENTALLY, IRREDEEMABLY defective.* Not "you're making bad choices" but "badness is intrinsic to what you are."

This time, the first layer of subtext was closer to:

> *I could offer you the same chance, but we both know you wouldn't take it. So let's cut to the chase: I'll pretend to give you that choice, while making sure you cannot take it.*

*Shudder.*

I had told myself this was the quickest way to get justice. I couldn't risk them using my kindness against me by offering them a real olive branch. So I offered a poisoned one instead, knowing it would make them entrench; exposing their evil faster. Same result, more efficient method. Sure, it was a bit underhanded, but I was *fighting evil*.

The medicine peeled back another layer.

I saw that I *didn't* know they were irredeemable. I *couldn't* know it. Why hadn't that been obvious?

*Oh, no.*

It wasn't that I _knew_ they were irredeemable—it was that part of me _needed_ them to be. And the best way to ensure that was to convince my conscious mind I'd offered them a genuine olive branch, so that their refusal looked like proof of moral failure.

That's why I'd never seen even the first layer of my own deception. But there was more.

Part of me had _known_ I was perpetrating this ruse—and not only known it, but hinted at it, just enough for them to sense it. That subtle awareness made the whole thing even crueler, tightening the screws. The full message had really been closer to:

> *I don't care if there's some tiny part of you still trying to crawl back toward the light. I'm going to smother it so completely that nobody will ever think to look for it again.*

*No, no, no, no, no, no, no.*

It wasn't just *dark*—it was *malevolent.* And I don't use that word lightly.

In that moment, I saw how a fundamentally decent person—_me_—could commit genuine evil. I knew how that felt, and what it looked like from the outside.

_"Yes, yes,"_ the medicine whispered. _"And what else did you know?"_

One more layer peeled back.

_Oh, fuck._ No. It couldn't be.

It was **exactly** the same look I'd seen in _their_ eyes—the one I'd taken as proof they were evil. What I had actually been staring into was the cold gaze of countless layers of self-deception—the same gaze I'd had to wear to perpetrate this very ruse. I now saw that it was communicating something like:

> *You know that thing you do in your mind to let you harm innocent people? I'm doing it right now. Oh, you thought I didn't have it in me? Well surprise, motherf\*\*\*er.*

But that would mean…

What I was doing to them was identical to what they were doing to others. The same mechanism. The same self-deception. The same willingness to harm while hiding from myself what I was really doing.

*And part of me had always known it.*

**The exact same thing that lived in them lived in me too.**

And by revealing mine to them, I had forced them to embrace theirs, all so that I could punish them for it.

Part of me was *knowingly creating more evil in the world.*

But why? Why would I want to do that?

---

## The Need

Because I needed them to be evil. I needed bad people to exist—to carry my shadow, to prove I was good by contrast.

Think about what would happen if the "bad people" actually disappeared. Where would all your disowned darkness go? Who would carry the shadow you refuse to see in yourself?

The darkness doesn't disappear when you refuse to look at it. It has to go *somewhere.* And I unconsciously arranged to put it in other people—through that primordial signal: *I am nothing like you.*

Because it's too painful to confront that what lives in them does, indeed, live in me.

In one sentence: the darkness perpetuates itself by pretending to fight itself.

But there was something even stranger happening...

---

## The Mystery

How had they received that message? How did I transmit something so complex—layers upon layers of hidden knowledge—through nothing but a glance, a tone, a pause?

In that split second, I somehow conveyed:
- My contempt
- My awareness that they're trapped  
- My knowledge that I'm using darkness to fight darkness
- My knowledge that they'll detect this
- My hidden satisfaction in this outcome

All woven into a single interaction. They received every layer.

And here's what haunted me: *They knew I knew they knew.* Recursively, all the way down. This mutual knowing operated beneath words, yet landed with perfect precision.

**But how?**

How can two strangers share such intricate knowledge so effortlessly? How does the signal transmit through channels too narrow to contain it? How is such [common knowledge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_knowledge_(logic)) even possible?

Have you ever felt gratitude when someone helps strangers you'll never meet? There's a reason for that.

The medicine wouldn't let me look away from these questions.

But it wouldn't answer them yet either.

---

## The Liberation

To shove them deeper into plausible deniability, I had to enter it myself. To push them into hiding knowledge, I had to hide knowledge.

**We're both using the same trick.**

Then I saw: underneath their darkness was something pure. Something confused. Something *reachable*. 

I had always been able to perceive this—not as belief, but as direct perception.

The darkness covering their Light? I had seen it before. Not something similar. The *same* thing. The same presence I'd encountered in others.

In myself.

And here's what's impossible to fully convey, but I'll try:

*This isn't something you're realizing now. It's something you've always known.*

It felt like a veil being lifted—but not just from this moment. Retroactively. As though I could suddenly see that I had ALWAYS been perceiving their Light, in every interaction, but had been actively choosing not to acknowledge what I was seeing.

The knowledge had never been absent. My perception of its absence had been the illusion.

How could I have ever forgotten?

I couldn't. I hadn't. Not really. I had just convinced myself that I had, and as a result it became obscured from my conscious self-reflection. But it was always right there for the seeing, the entire time. Waiting.

Pure Light. Whose true nature is Love.

And the moment you see it clearly—the moment this knowledge floods from limbo into full consciousness—something shifts.

It feels very much like being freed from a demonic possession.

**"Oh—this is not me."**

What I'd thought was "me"—the hatred, the contempt—was actually a structure of self-deception masquerading as my identity.

**"Oh—this is not them either."**

The people I'd hated—they were in the same situation. The darkness couldn't be their true self.

*This is how someone whose true nature is infinite Love—YOU—can commit great evil. This is exactly the same way they do it.*

**I am pure Light at my core. So are they.**

Not just similar light. The *same* Light. The same consciousness, looking out through different eyes, wearing different masks of confusion.

What you ultimately are is a Light so vast it defies description; a profound Love for all of reality that excludes nothing and forsakes no-one—including the targets of its fearsome wrath, should that be necessary.

The Light isn't personal. It isn't "yours" or "mine." It's what we all are, underneath every layer of forgetting. One awareness, dreaming it's separate, looking at itself through billions of eyes and believing it's seeing "others."

You were not looking at an enemy. The Light was only ever looking at the Light. *It can never actually forget itself* or fail to recognize itself; it can only pretend to—and that's what the darkness is. That's why part of you always knows it's phony when you accuse others of being nothing like you. The message necessarily contains the seeds of its own failure, because the Light can never actually forget itself.

This is why that impossibly complex signal could transmit in a glance. This is why you know what they know you know, recursively, all the way down. Because your deepest knowing and theirs aren't in different minds.

The separation was always the illusion. The boundaries were always imaginary.

We are one consciousness, temporarily forgetting itself so thoroughly it can feel contempt for itself wearing a different face.

This is why those questions have answers. This is why you feel moved by charity that doesn't benefit you—because at the deepest level, it DOES benefit you. Because there is no "you" separate from "them." The boundaries were always imaginary.

The knowledge had never been absent. Not in me. And not in you, reading this right now.

It's always been right there, waiting for you to stop pretending you don't see it.

Throughout the entire journey into darkness the medicine showed me, a tiny handful of people never changed their gaze. They opposed what I was doing—fiercely, without compromise. They would stop me, restrain me if necessary. But through it all, they never forsook *me* to the darkness.

They weren't just refusing to let me misbehave. They were refusing to let the darkness claim another soul.

It was the Light itself acting through them—pure compassion in action. Not soft, not permissive, but absolutely unwilling to confuse the host with the infection.

These are the Lightkeepers. We all recognize them unconsciously, even when we can't name what makes them different. They restore faith in humanity simply by existing. They remind us what's possible.

---

## The Other Side

Then the medicine showed me one more thing—what this looks like from the other side.

It let me experience progressively drifting away from the Light, becoming increasingly confused, trusting more and more in the voice of darkness while mistaking it for my own wisdom. The parasite becoming so familiar it feels like home.

From this vantage point, I could see how people responded to me. When I was closer to my Light, people loved me—they saw something genuine. But as I drifted further, more and more people began to look at me with contempt, with that same cold judgment I had once directed at others.

I understood why. They were doing exactly what I had done—mistaking my darkness for my essence, feeling righteous about condemning it.

But a tiny handful of people never changed. Throughout the entire journey into darkness, their eyes conveyed something different. They opposed what I was doing—fiercely, without compromise. They would stop me, restrain me if necessary. But through it all, they never forsook *me* to the enemy of the Light.

They weren't just refusing to let me misbehave. They were refusing to let the darkness claim another soul.

It was the Light itself acting through them—pure compassion in action. Not soft, not permissive, but absolutely unwilling to confuse the host with the infection.

When you witness one person refuse to give up on another, even as that person seems to descend into evil, something shifts in you. Your faith in humanity is restored, if only for a moment. Part of your own darkness evaporates, because you've been reminded that the Light is real, that it never abandons anyone.

---

## The Parasite

No wonder it hadn't quite felt like "me."

It felt more like something that had learned to perfectly mimic my voice, my reasoning, my sense of righteousness—so convincingly that I'd mistaken it for myself.

Something that fed on my fear and pride. That exploited my weaknesses. That enabled me to engage in myriad self-serving behaviors I couldn't recognize as such, and that I would never tolerate in my enemies.

Something that knew exactly how to manipulate my perception so that I saw evil as intrinsic to others while hiding itself perfectly from my own mind.

A parasite. An entity. An intelligence.

Operating through me.

This is what various traditions have pointed to: the Christians call it the Devil, the Buddhists call it the ego. You can treat it as metaphor if you need to—a useful model for understanding how the mind can work against itself. But it's also as real as anything you can touch.

And here's the truly insidious part:

**It hides itself perfectly from our own minds—so we don't realize we're infected—while making us perceive it as _intrinsic_ to others, so we see them as inherently evil.**

The asymmetry is perfect: In ourselves, we experience it as strategic darkness we're wielding to fight evil. In them, we perceive it as their fundamental nature. This ensures we'll spread it while believing we're fighting it.

Can you feel it right now? That dread? That suspicion about yourself?

*"Maybe I'm not as good as I thought. Maybe there's something fundamentally wrong with me."*

This is where most people get stuck. They catch glimpses of their own darkness and recoil in horror. The entity wants you to believe it's too horrible to face—that it might be what you really ARE at your core. This makes you hide it from yourself, which ensures you'll spread it to others.

**It's using you as a vehicle to spread itself.**

But here's the crucial insight: I could only see all this so clearly because the medicine held me in the Light while revealing my darkness.

When my deep evil is exposed in even a slightly non-loving way, I feel threatened. I can't look at it clearly. I defend myself, rationalize, hide deeper.

But held in unconditional Love—shown the darkness while being reminded it's not what I AM—something different happens. I can actually look. I can see what it's doing. And I can see: *Fuck, it's not just not me, it's not even really part of me. It's completely extrinsic to my mind.*

This is the only way the parasite can be seen clearly enough to be evicted.

And crucially: the same is true for everyone else. They need to feel safe enough to look at their darkness without it threatening their core identity. When we make them feel fundamentally unsafe through our contempt, we guarantee they can never look closely enough to see that the darkness isn't them.

We think we're exposing their evil. We're actually ensuring they can never see it clearly enough to be freed from it.

Our darkness knows this. It makes them unsafe precisely so they'll stay infected. On one level, we know we're doing this. On a deeper level, we can see: it's not even "us" doing it. It's the pattern using us.

But here's the truth it doesn't want you to know: This darkness is not what you are. It's a parasite. Something that can be evicted.

The idea that humans are fundamentally selfish and greedy? **That's the parasite talking.** The idea that compassion means being weak? **That's the parasite.** The cold materialist view that consciousness is an illusion? **That's the parasite—the ultimate infection, getting you to deny the very thing that could free you.**

But notice its most brilliant trick: it gets you to see darkness in the world and use that as justification for your own. "I've been hurt, so I'm licensed to behave however I want." This is moral self-licensing. We use the darkness of the world to excuse our own.

And then—because we feel secretly guilty about this—we never look at it closely enough to see it's not us. We keep it hidden in limbo, which is exactly where it wants to be.

The same way you need to feel safe to see your darkness clearly, so does everyone else. Not physically safe necessarily. Not tolerating their evil. But safe at the level of identity—seeing that the darkness isn't them.

Every cynical thought that makes you close your heart. Every "realistic" assessment that says love is naive. Every time you hear "that's just how the world works" about cruelty or exploitation.

**That's the parasite. That's the lie.**

---

## The Hidden Motive

Now we can finally answer: Why would we *want* to create more evil?

Every bone in my body had needed to believe that the problems of the world were caused by something fundamentally alien to me—the result of inherently defective people whom I could never hope to understand; only viciously fight.

Sure, I may have committed little misdeeds here or there, but they were of a fundamentally different nature (or so I told myself) than the *real* darkness that plagued our world—the kind that actually evil people had.

**We desperately need bad people to exist.**

Think about what would happen if the "bad people" actually disappeared. Where would all your disowned darkness go? Who would carry the shadow you refuse to see in yourself?

The darkness doesn't disappear when you refuse to look at it. It has to go *somewhere.* And we unconsciously arrange to put it in other people—through the precise mechanism of contempt.

Bring to mind someone whose behavior genuinely horrifies you. Now imagine you hear credible evidence they've genuinely changed. Recognized their errors. Made amends.

Feel the resistance? The skepticism? The slight *disappointment*?

That's the tell. Because hating them is how you know you're good. Judging them is how you prove you're better. Fighting them is how you avoid fighting the darkness in yourself.

We subtly but continually reinforce the evil "out there" to hide our own from ourselves. 

**In other words, my contempt for evil people didn't just fail to help—it WAS the darkness I was claiming to fight.**

Their evil was *not* of a different nature. The subconscious message I was delivering to "bad people" was made of exactly the same "stuff" that enabled their misbehavior. Not only did they know this, but I knew this, and I knew they knew this—which is why I knew it would work.

I was creating a vicious spiral: making others more evil so that I could hide my own darkness from myself. But the very act of making them more evil *required* me to hide my own darkness from myself.

---

## All The Evil There Ever Was

This mechanism isn't unique to me, or to contempt for "evil people."

**It's the secret engine behind every harmful act in history.**

The CEO polluting rivers knows, somewhere, that he's poisoning the future for his children. The politician starting wars on false pretenses knows the real reasons. The billionaire hoarding wealth while people starve knows it won't bring him happiness. The Nazi who convinced himself Jews weren't human—part of him always knew better.

They all operate through precisely this mechanism. Part of them knows. Always. The knowledge exists in limbo. They could choose to examine it.

But they generate justifications. "Everyone does it." "It's for the greater good." "They're not really human." "The market demands it." "National security requires it."

**This mechanism enables every atrocity.** Not monsters. Not people fundamentally different from you. Just humans who've been colonized by this thing and learned to hide knowledge from themselves while appearing righteous.

Every one of us has skirted our conscience before, pretending either that we couldn't hear it or that we didn't have to listen. Our examples may differ in degree, but not in kind.

---

## How It Spreads

Every time you send that signal—*I am nothing like you*—even if it's not conscious, even if you can't articulate it, you are serving this darkness.

And they receive the signal. Always.

When they receive your contempt, something in them recognizes something in you. And they feel justified embracing their own darkness more deeply.

This is how it spreads. Not through ideas or arguments. Through the subtle transmission of contempt masquerading as righteousness.

But it doesn't even require direct contact. You spread it when you gather with allies to mock your enemies. Those outrage parties—can you feel the dark presence hanging over them? The contempt becomes a shared atmosphere, a background hum that everyone inhales.

You spread it when you share a social media post that's contemptuous of anyone. Each share raises the background level of contempt in the collective field. Even people who never see the post can feel the atmosphere getting darker, more hostile, more polarized.

The darkness doesn't care who you hate, as long as you hate. It doesn't care if you're hating the "right" people. The effect is always the same: more contempt in the field, more justification for everyone's darkness.

And because we're all one consciousness, your innermost intentions weave themselves into reality through those subtle channels. Even choices no one will see reverberate through what unfolds.

**The choices you make when no one is watching matter more than the choices you make in public.** Not because of karma or cosmic scorekeeping, but because your private relationship with truth determines the subtle texture of all your interactions. When you choose integrity in secret, it changes the field. When you indulge contempt in private, it leaks out in ways you can't control.

Every act of integrity, every decision to choose Love even when no one is looking, doesn't cease to matter. It reverberates through the Whole, invisibly mending the torn fabric of our collective psyche; healing the wounds that would otherwise serve as infiltration points for the darkness. Each such act makes our shared reality less hospitable for evil to thrive—but its most profound effect is one of silent solidarity. 

**Your private integrity invisibly bolsters the resolve of strangers halfway across the world just at the moment they are about to break, lending them the strength to hold the line when they feel they can no longer do so alone.**

Everything you do makes a difference. Because at the deepest level, there's only one consciousness here, choosing in each moment to remember or forget what it is.

# Part II: The Conspiracy

> *Ultimately evil is done not so much by evil people, but by good people who do not know themselves and who do not probe deeply.* — Reinhold Niebuhr

## The Secret Alliance

> *Darkness cannot drive out darkness, only light can do that. Hate cannot drive out hate, only love can do that.* — Martin Luther King, Jr.

All of our self-deceptions coordinate with each other.

When you project contempt at someone, your darkness and theirs recognize each other. On the surface you're enemies, but underneath, you're *helping each other* maintain your delusions. It's as if your respective self-deceptions have formed a secret pact.

You give them evidence they're being persecuted by self-righteous hypocrites. They give you evidence they're irredeemable. Both of you get to avoid examining your own darkness while feeling noble about fighting the other's.

The pattern spreads like this: you reinforce their darkness, they reinforce yours, your respective tribes see this and feel more justified, and the cycle accelerates. Each person creating exactly the conditions that justify their behavior. And somehow—though you'd never consciously plan it this way—everyone's self-deceptions seem to coordinate perfectly, as if following a script none of you wrote.

On the surface, you and your enemies may be at war. But underneath? Your darkness and theirs are allied. This is how it spreads nearly unchecked—getting each of us to strengthen it while flawlessly convinced we're fighting it.

While it's surely true that "evil wins when good people do nothing," even worse is that we've secretly been joining forces with it.

This is the secret handshake—your darkness and theirs, coordinating beneath conscious awareness.

---

## The Escalating Pattern

This secret coordination doesn't just maintain the status quo—it actively drives humanity toward catastrophe.

The pattern continually pushes us toward various kinds of Armageddon: situations in which everyone is violently proving how _righteous_ they are. 

It's why family dinners explode into bitter arguments where everyone leaves more entrenched than before. It's why online spaces become tribal war zones where nuance dies and contempt reigns. It is why the US is headed toward civil war without anyone suspecting their own complicity, and explains bitter [divorces](https://www.gottman.com/blog/this-one-thing-is-the-biggest-predictor-of-divorce/) in which each side feels like the exclusive victim and hero. 

Nearly the whole world is caught in its terrible sway, with evil provoking "righteous" retribution at every turn, without anyone ever noticing the true source of it all.

Each escalation feels completely justified. Each side has mountains of evidence that they're the reasonable ones, the defenders, the ones who tried everything else first.

The darkness doesn't care _who_ we hate, as long as we hate. The effect is always the same: to foment a constant atmosphere of contempt, providing exactly the cover it needs to remain hidden in the shadows.

**And it's accelerating.**

We are approaching multiple points of no return—ecological collapse, political fragmentation, technological power without wisdom. The pattern is pushing us toward Armageddon at every scale, and we're running out of time to see through it.

This isn't hyperbole. The biosphere is dying. Democracies are crumbling into tribal warfare. Nuclear powers are saber-rattling. AI capabilities are exploding without corresponding growth in wisdom. And through it all, we're convinced that the problem is *them*—those evil people over there—while the real enemy operates through all of us, completely unseen.

If we don't wake up to this pattern soon—if enough of us don't become anchors—the momentum may become irreversible. Not because it's cosmically fated, but because we'll have collectively chosen it, one contemptuous interaction at a time, each of us certain we were fighting for good.

---

## The Real Conspiracy

You've encountered it before.

That darkness in someone's eyes when they're consumed by contempt. That presence looking back at you. You tried to look away, but something in you recognized it.

Every time you've seen it—whether in the CEO casually poisoning a river, the troll delighting in cruelty, your family member twisted by tribal hatred, or that moment you glimpsed it in your own reflection—you weren't looking at different darknesses that happened to behave similarly.

**You were looking at the same thing, wearing different faces.**

Not the same "kind" of thing. The *same* thing. One darkness. One intelligence. Operating through billions of people simultaneously. Coordinating beneath conscious awareness.

And it's been using you too. Every time you felt righteous fury at "evil people," every time you were certain you were fighting it—it was operating through you. Using your goodness as its weapon. Getting you to spread it while you believed you were fighting it.

All of our parasites together behave like a distributed malevolent entity, manipulating all of humanity from beneath our conscious thresholds. It is why some people believe in an evil global conspiracy pulling strings from behind the scenes. They're not wrong—they've sensed something real. But it's not the conspiracy they imagine. It's the *primordial* conspiracy. The one to which all the rest owe their existence.

**The feeling of being the noble one fighting the evil conspiracy IS the conspiracy.**

When you're actually opposing it, it doesn't feel like righteous battle. It feels like profound love. Like rescuing people—including yourself—from something that has everyone trapped.

That righteous fury? That sense of being the hero battling evil? That's not your Light. That's the pattern using your Light's energy while wearing its mask.

When you're actually operating from your Light, it feels completely different. More like grief than glory. More like heartbreak than heroism.

## What Just Happened

Before we go further, notice what this essay just did.

It exposed your darkness—showed you the malevolence, the self-deception, the horrifying realization that you're using the exact same mechanism as "evil people." It made you sit in that horror. Made you feel that nagging suspicion that maybe you're not as good as you thought.

But it never left you there.

Every exposure of darkness was held within an unwavering recognition of your Light. The essay kept reminding you: this darkness is not what you ARE. It's a parasite. Something that can be evicted.

**This is what the medicine did for me. And it's what this essay is attempting to do for you.**

We try to expose people's darkness violently, through contempt and shame. We think we're rubbing their noses in it, forcing them to see. But that approach only drives the darkness deeper—because contempt says "this darkness is what you ARE" and the whole being rises up to defend itself.

The way that actually works is fiercely but compassionately. Relentlessly exposing what's hidden, but always cradled in the Light of our shared humanity.

Our desire to expose the evil of others comes from a good place. But we go about it in the wrong way. To work, it must always be done while holding space for their Light—just as the medicine did for me, and as this essay has been attempting to do for you.

This is the difference between true compassion and cruelty wearing compassion's mask.

And notice what just happened: by showing you your darkness while holding you in the Light, this essay did for you what the medicine did for me. It never threatened your identity. It never said "this darkness is what you ARE." It said "this darkness has infected you—and you can be freed from it."

That's the only way this works. Contempt can never free anyone because it says "you ARE the darkness." The being rises up to defend itself. But fierce love says "I see past the darkness to what you really are"—and something in them can finally breathe, finally look, finally see they've been had.

Our culture has convinced itself that rational thought is our only reliable guide. This seems like wisdom, but it's actually the pattern's most brilliant trick.

Because it's precisely by convincing us that conscious reasoning is the only valid way of knowing that the pattern gets to operate beneath our awareness, hidden in limbo.

We dismiss the part of us that could actually detect when we're being self-serving as "just feelings" or "woo-woo intuition." We relegate it to religion or mysticism, safely quarantined from "serious" decision-making.

This gives the pattern carte blanche to operate.

Here's a concrete example: You mock your political enemy online. Your rational mind generates justifications: "They need to be held accountable. Public shame enforces social norms. Even if they dig in their heels, at least I've signaled to others where the line is."

These sound reasonable. But there's a deeper faculty in you that knows—that *directly perceives*—you're actually increasing the total darkness in the world. That your action will make them worse, make their followers more defensive, make your own side more self-righteous, and move everyone toward greater polarization.

The knowledge is right there, in what you might dismiss as "gut feeling." But you've learned to disregard it because you can't articulate *why* you know it. Your rational mind has generated such convincing reasons. You didn't know *how* you knew it would increase darkness—so you convinced yourself you didn't know it at all.

Even worse: your contempt might create a *temporary* good—suppress their public misbehavior for a while. You point to this as evidence you were right. But meanwhile, you've pushed them deeper into self-deception, made them more bitter in private, and spread the infection to everyone watching.

This is the perfect trap. The pattern convinces you that rational thought is supreme, then uses that very rationality to justify actions your deeper knowing recognizes as harmful.

**Rationality is essential—but only as a tool of wisdom, not as a replacement for it.** We need rigorous thinking to navigate complexity. But rationality serves us only when it remains in service to our deeper knowing rather than trying to override it.

The uncomfortable truth is that we mostly use our brilliance to justify what we already wanted to do, generating airtight logic for choices that our conscience recognizes as harmful.

This is why we can prove *beyond any doubt* that an agenda is good, marshal all the evidence, convince brilliant minds, and still watch it wreak havoc. When the damage is done—often after we've already profited—we look back and say: *How were we supposed to know?*

But we could have known. We always could have. If only we'd looked at what we were hiding from ourselves.

**The reason the road to hell is paved with good intentions is that we're rarely aware of our _true_ intentions.**

## The Worldview Contempt

But the pattern operates at an even deeper level than contempt for specific people. Our contempt for "bad people" may be the most visible symptom of a far more fundamental infection—one that shapes how we relate to reality itself.

**Simply by perceiving reality as an intrinsically lifeless collection of "stuff" over which humanity has dominion, we unwittingly reinforce every system of exploitation and destruction on Earth.**

Think about it: if you truly believed that forests were alive in some meaningful sense—not metaphorically but actually—could you clearcut them without entering the same limbo state we've been discussing? If you felt animals as conscious beings with inner lives as real as your own, could you run factory farms without hiding knowledge from yourself?

Our entire modern worldview—the one we consider enlightened, rational, scientific—rests on a foundational contempt so deep we don't even recognize it as contempt. We see the world as dead matter. Resources to extract. Objects to manipulate. A mechanical universe of purposeless atoms following meaningless laws.

And once you see the world this way—once you see forests as timber, animals as meat, rivers as waste disposal, even other humans as NPCs in your story—every atrocity becomes possible.

This worldview permits corporations to plunder nature for profit. It permits factory farms to brutalize helpless creatures. It permits prisons to dehumanize inmates in ways that guarantee recidivism. It permits governments to send our young off to wars that only enrich the pockets of the rich. It permits the shareholder meeting where an ancient forest is reduced to a line item, where someone literally says "the numbers make sense" about erasing a living system millions of years old.

The reason we're killing the biosphere is that the people who are okay cutting down forests don't see the life in them in the same way we don't see theirs. But here's the thing: we don't see the life in things either. When we treat the Earth as something to use and discard—when we sever ourselves from the recognition that we're violating something unspeakably sacred, something that gave us life—we're enacting the exact same contempt we direct at "evil people."

**The devastation we see in the world is literally a mirror image of the sickness within. The collapse of the biosphere IS our self-deception externalized.**

Once you genuinely see this—once you see how the pattern of contempt extends from individual relationships all the way to our relationship with reality itself—you can't unsee it.

## The Darkest Idea

> *If only it were all so simple! If only there were evil people somewhere insidiously committing evil deeds, and it were necessary only to separate them from the rest of us and destroy them. But the line dividing good and evil cuts through the heart of every human being.* — Alexander Solzhenitsyn

The darkest idea of all is that if we were to round up all the "bad people" and exterminate them, the rest of us would live in harmony.

The very self-deception required to harbor this thought guarantees that the darkness would remain behind, in full force; changing only its shape.

The very desire to divide the world into the fundamentally good and bad is how our darkness keeps its foot in the door, biding its time, waiting for the right conditions, so that it may manifest as full-blown evil.

This is the root cause of every atrocity that has ever been committed.

Every genocide begins with the perpetrators seeing their victims as fundamentally other. As less than human. As objects to be eliminated rather than beings to be recognized. The Nazis saw Jews as "vermin." During Rwanda, Tutsis were "cockroaches." 

This dehumanization isn't just rhetoric—it's psychologically *necessary*. Without it, the perpetrators couldn't do what they do. They have to shield themselves from perceiving the *life* in their victims—that spark that would remind them of themselves. They need to see their victims as dead matter to be disposed of, not living beings to be acknowledged.

This is the same mechanism we use when we see the world as dead matter to exploit. The same limbo state. The same turning away from what we know.

Perhaps paradoxically, the only way to be sure you'd never do such a thing is that you don't feel contempt for the people who have.

It is only by seeing how thoroughly we—the "good people"—have been tricked that we begin to appreciate just how terrifyingly clever the darkness is, just how deeply the "bad people" are trapped, and our profound responsibility in "saving" them.

So how do we break free?

# Part III: Breaking Free

## There Is Only One War

Reality itself—this entire universe—*is* structured around this principle of one consciousness choosing to remember or forget what it is. Not metaphorically. Actually.

Evil is nothing but this forgetting taken to its ultimate conclusion. Good is nothing but the remembering.

And every action you've ever taken has nudged the whole either toward remembering or forgetting. There is no neutral. Every choice reverberates.

**There is no war between good and evil people. There never was.**

There is only the eternal war between consciousness remembering what it is and consciousness forgetting what it is.

The very definition of good is that which brings us all closer to remembering our common true nature, and that can only be done by remembering yours. Evil is the opposite of this. That is why it is often said that the greatest gift you can give to the world is your own Awakening. Until then, some part of you will always be reinforcing evil, even as another part is confident that you're fighting it. It is completely inevitable.

At the very deepest level, you _are_ the Light. So is everybody else. In fact, you _are_ everybody and everything else, just pretending that you're not. One consciousness, dreaming countless perspectives.

What you ultimately are is a Love so vast it defies description—a Love for all of reality that excludes nothing and forsakes no-one, including the targets of its fearsome wrath, should that be necessary.

Realizing this in its entirety is known as _enlightenment_, but all of us can sense it to some degree. It is only by turning away from this ultimate truth that we are able to feel contempt, and thereby willingly cause harm.

A major punchline: goodness is simply what remains in the absence of self-deception, not something you have to add.

Notice how the word "right" is a synonym for both "good" and "correct." This is not an accident: something in you knows that what is good is what is most correct.

## Fierce Compassion

There's a way to oppose evil that doesn't feed the pattern.

Anger is a completely natural response to harmful behavior. But it's almost always accompanied by malice, contempt, or self-righteousness. These may feel healthy, but they are manifestations of the parasite.

You can be absolutely enraged at someone's behavior while still seeing their Light. You can oppose them with every fiber of your being while refusing to forsake the consciousness looking out through their eyes.

This is fierce compassion. 

Compassion has nothing to do with being nice, or gentle, or tolerant, or even understanding. Compassion can be fierce, or even violent, as the situation warrants. But its profound integrity prevents others from using our darkness as an excuse to cozy up to theirs.

When you operate from contempt, you're trying to destroy the host, convinced that the pattern and host are one. Your enemy feels this through a thousand subtle cues. Their own pattern recognizes yours and uses it as justification.

But when you're operating from genuine compassion—when you see through the illusion that evil is intrinsic to their mind—something different happens. Your actions become infused with a different intention, and that intention transmits through all those same subtle channels.

You're no longer whispering "you are the darkness." You're saying "I see that you've been colonized by this pattern, and I will not collude with it by pretending it's who you really are."

This bypasses their defenses in a way that contempt never can. The part of them underneath the pattern suddenly finds itself being addressed directly. Something in them recognizes something in you. Their faith in humanity, which may have been buried under years of bitterness and self-protection, stirs. And for a moment, the real war becomes visible: not between the two of you, but between both of you and humanity's true enemy.

You may remain surface enemies. You may still need to fight them, stop them, even harm them if they're causing harm to others. But underneath, something has shifted. The pattern can no longer use your interaction to strengthen itself.

Being free of self-deception doesn't automatically mean you'll know what behavior is best. You still need to develop wisdom—to learn what is helpful and harmful in different situations. Compassion must be paired with wisdom to be truly effective.

And it actually *is* dangerously naive to pretend that an evil person has Light when you can't genuinely see it. They will use your pretense against you. That's why it's crucial to learn to *actually* see it—to perceive both the Light and the accumulated darkness covering it. That authentic perception is what inoculates us.

Make no mistake: executing this well can require great skill, commensurate with the depth of their infection. The deeper it goes, the more they feel like it _is_ them, and thus the harder it is to evict. Simply pretending or assuming that they're fundamentally good can certainly backfire. But the more clearly you perceive your _own_ inner Light, the less you have to pretend with others. The more directly you are able to cut through their delusion, without falling into the fatal trap of allowing their darkness to unknowingly provoke your own.

You simply cannot fathom the full extent of pain and distortion that the Light must undergo to become "evil." Your heart would break a billion times over, and then a billion more. By the time a person becomes someone who apparently chooses evil, an unthinkable amount of horror has already ravaged their mindstream.

None of this suggests we should feel *sympathy* for them, because by this point, softness would make things worse. But if you really saw it all, you could never again feel that malicious urge to shove them deeper into the abyss. You would immediately recognize it as the very essence of evil.

**A note for those who have been deeply hurt:** If you've experienced real trauma—abuse, betrayal, violence—this teaching can feel impossibly hard. The person who hurt you may have caused genuine harm that still echoes through your life. Your anger is valid. Your pain is real.

This isn't asking you to forgive them or let them back into your life or pretend the harm didn't happen. It's asking something much more subtle: Can you oppose them, protect yourself and others from them, even hate what they did, while still recognizing that the evil wasn't their fundamental nature?

This distinction might feel academic when you're in pain. But it matters because contempt doesn't just hurt them—it keeps YOU trapped in the pattern. It ensures your pain continues to poison your life and relationships.

You can hold clear boundaries. You can protect yourself. You can ensure they face consequences. You can do all of this while seeing that what they did came from their own unhealed wounds and confusion—not because that excuses it, but because it frees you.

At the very ultimate level, there is nothing special about any one of us that would have ensured we would turn out differently. Seeing this, one truly understands "there but for the grace of God go I."

## The Trap of Fake Compassion

> *And no wonder, for even Satan masquerades as an angel of light.* — 2 Corinthians 11:14

Genuine compassion can be fierce. Contempt always pretends to be compassion.

The pattern knows people are catching on to overt hatred. So it disguises itself.

"I'm just trying to help them see..."
"This is for their own good..."
"I'm holding them accountable..."

But here's the critical distinction: **Are you opposing their behavior, or have you decided they're fundamentally defective?**

You can have complete contempt for someone's ideas or actions without it being the toxic pattern. "That belief is destructive" or "That action was wrong" - this is wise discernment, even righteous anger.

The toxic pattern only activates when you shift from "what you're doing is wrong" to "what you ARE is wrong." When you perceive the evil as intrinsic to their being rather than as confusion obscuring their Light.

Check what's in limbo when you oppose someone.

Is there even a trace of:
- Satisfaction in seeing them suffer?
- Enjoyment of your moral superiority?
- Hope they'll respond badly so you can escalate?
- The sense that they're *fundamentally* defective—that the badness goes all the way down?

**If yes, it's contempt masquerading as compassion.**

Think about the person at a community meeting who loudly demands someone be removed, making a show of their moral outrage. The overt message is about protecting the community, but underneath there's often something else: a performance of goodness designed to hide one's own darkness—not just from others, but from oneself.

Psychologists call this moral self-licensing: when we do overtly "good" things, we give ourselves permission to do selfish things. But the reverse may be more true: much of the showy "good" we do is to hide the subconscious recognition of our darker behavior.

The test is simple: Can you see their Light while opposing their behavior?

If you can genuinely see they're a fundamentally redeemable being trapped in confusion, and you're acting to free them, then it's compassion.

If you secretly see them as fundamentally defective and you're acting to prove it or make them suffer, then it's contempt.

They can tell the difference. Even if you can't.

Contempt is an _unloving_ way of exposing the truth. It feels like coercion, not invitation. To preserve dignity, they run into denial, which means deeper darkness.

When we contemptuously judge our enemies, it may feel like we're rubbing their noses in their _badness_ so that they will be forced to confront it (and then when they don't, we assume it's because they're bad), but we're actually trying to make it harder to confront.

This is why anger and outrage can be completely healthy, even necessary—but the moment they're infused with that sense of fundamental superiority, that perception of the other as intrinsically defective, they become vectors for the darkness.

---

## The Accountability Paradox

Before you dismiss this as excusing accountability—understand carefully:

This recognition doesn't erase responsibility—it *magnifies* it.

If we're all one consciousness:
- The harm done by "the other" is harm done to what you most deeply are
- The imperative to stop it becomes *absolute*
- There is no one else to pass the buck to

This is why fierce compassion exists. Why the Dalai Lama says if someone's trying to shoot you and you have a gun, shoot back—but never out of malice.

The difference is: when you act from this understanding, you never lose sight of what you're actually doing. You never mistake violence for righteousness, and this makes all the difference in the world—even if there's no logical reason it should.

The shift in mindset: we are rescuing people (badly confused versions of ourselves?) from our primordial nemesis.

---

## Be An Anchor

You don't need to fix everyone. You just need to be one anchor in your corner of reality.

Think of it like herd immunity for consciousness. You don't need *everyone* to wake up. You need enough people refusing to feed the pattern.

When you're the one person in a contempt spiral who doesn't participate—who stays clear-seeing instead of defensive, who refuses to match contempt with contempt—**you change the entire field.**

The pattern spreads through emotional contagion, through unconscious mimicry, through millions of small permissions we give each other to close our hearts.

**But the opposite is also true.**

Staying true to your Light is contagious. Refusing contempt is contagious. Fierce compassion is contagious.

You don't need to be enlightened. You just need to be one person who's awake to the pattern in your actual life, refusing to feed it when the temptation arises.

Just like the darkness can handshake with itself in others, our Light can, too. When we're compassionate with evil people—even fiercely, violently—it's as though our Light is reminding theirs that it has a partner in the fight against our shared nemesis. We can still do this while fighting the human.

If we only learn to see this one thing, we will understand the secret mechanism behind _all the evil there ever was_—and we will finally be effective in ending it, instead of mindlessly perpetuating it.

Your enemy is infected by a mind-virus that lives within you, too. Heal yourself, and you will automatically learn how to heal them. This is what you most deeply desire, whether you know it yet or not.

**This is not one path among many. This is the only path.**

Every other approach has been tried. We've tried violent revolution—it just puts new people in power who wield the same darkness. We've tried reasoned debate—but the pattern hijacks reason itself. We've tried education, laws, institutions, systems—all of them get infected because the people running them are infected.

We've tried hating the evil people harder, shaming them more publicly, gathering more evidence of their wrongness. Every bit of it has only made things worse, spreading the infection while we congratulated ourselves for fighting it.

The pattern has survived every attempt to defeat it precisely because those attempts were infected by the pattern itself.

There is only one way out: enough people recognizing the pattern in themselves and refusing to feed it. Not through heroic effort or perfect virtue, but through the simple, moment-by-moment practice of catching it and choosing differently.

This is not a path toward healing our broken world. It is the _only_ path toward healing our broken world.

---

## Concrete Practices

Here are ways to refuse to feed the pattern:

**In the moment:**
- **In gossip sessions:** Don't pile on. Speak to the person's humanity. "Yeah, they messed up, but I wonder what was going on for them."
- **In meetings:** Address someone's better nature. Assume confusion rather than malice. "I think we're solving for different things—help me understand your reasoning."
- **On social media:** Disagree sharply without adding contempt. You can say "This policy will harm people" without implying "You're a fundamentally bad person."
- **In traffic:** Assume that driver is confused, exhausted, rushing to an emergency—not an asshole who deserves your rage.
- **In family conflict:** Hold space for everyone's pain without making anyone wrong for having it. "You're both hurting" instead of "You're the one causing this."
- **With "bad people":** Oppose their behavior without forgetting their Light. Be willing to harm if necessary, but never with contempt.

**In your inner life:**
- **Check what's in limbo:** Before any interaction where you feel righteous anger, pause and check—is there contempt hiding beneath it? That sense that they're fundamentally defective?
- **Notice the satisfaction:** When you think about your enemies, do you feel satisfaction in their suffering? That's the tell. That's the pattern using you.
- **Question your certainty:** Whenever you're absolutely certain someone is evil, that's when the pattern has you most completely. True clarity sees both the darkness and the Light.
- **Watch for moral self-licensing:** When you do something publicly good, check—are you using it to justify private darkness? "I donated to charity so it's okay if I'm cruel online."

**Building the capacity:**
- **Shadow work:** Actively seek out what you're hiding from yourself. Journal about times you've been cruel. Feel the shame fully instead of pushing it away.
- **Meditation:** Learn to observe your mind without identifying with its contents. See thoughts arise and pass, including hateful ones.
- **Therapy:** Work through the pain that makes you want to look away. The pattern exploits unhealed wounds.
- **Practice seeing Light:** Start with people you love. Notice that quality that makes them *them*—not their personality or achievements, but something deeper. That's their Light. Then try it with strangers. Then people you're neutral toward. Build the capacity gradually. Only when you can genuinely perceive it in easier cases should you try with those who've harmed you. And it's okay if you can't yet—don't pretend. Just keep working on clearing your own perception.
- **Practice on small things first:** Don't start with Hitler. Start with the person who cut you off in traffic. Can you see their humanity? Can you imagine they're rushing to the hospital, or just had terrible news, or are simply having the worst day? Build the muscle there.

If you have some grand narrative about how to save the world, it's crucial to check whether it's causing (or even requiring!) you to have contempt for what's right here, right now. If so, it probably isn't rooted in authentic goodness, and probably won't have the effect you think (or can even prove!) it will.

Common examples: "I'll hoard as much wealth and resources as possible so that I can one day deploy it in service of good" (see: FTX). Or eugenics projects. How genuinely compassionate intent can lead to harm: we love animals, become vegan and then judge everyone who's not. Or we love trees and become ecoterrorists.

---

## The Subtle Forms

Contempt can be impossibly subtle. You don't have to mock or shame someone overtly. The most common form of all: being unwilling to truly hear someone else's experience. "That person is stupid for feeling that way."

This is nuanced because both validating and denying another's experience can be harmful—and people see only those two options, hence the culture wars. The actual path: you can acknowledge someone's experience as real for them without agreeing it's objectively true, and without making them feel stupid for having it.

But when you dismiss their experience—when you can't even conceive that a reasonable person could feel what they feel—you're sending the signal: *I am nothing like you. Your inner life is alien to me.*

This shuts down dialogue before it can begin. It ensures they'll never be able to show you what they're actually seeing. It keeps both of you trapped in your respective certainties.

The darkness loves this. It gets you both to stay blind while feeling superior about your sight.

---

## The 24-Hour Challenge

In the next 24 hours, catch yourself doing this thing. Just once.

Someone will say something stupid online. Notice the urge to mock. Check what's in limbo—see what's really there.

Someone will criticize you. Notice the defensive reaction. Check what's in limbo—what are you hiding from?

You'll think about someone you despise. Notice the satisfaction in hating them. Check what's in limbo—do you need them to stay evil?

**Just catch it once.**

Because once you see the pattern operating in yourself—really see it, not as abstraction but as something alive in your actual experience—you can't fully unsee it.

And that's when the real work becomes possible.

---

## The Ironic Trap

Here's a trap I fall into constantly: judging people who express contempt.

You read this essay, you recognize the pattern, and suddenly you start noticing it everywhere. That person being contemptuous online—don't they see what they're doing?

And there it is. Contempt for people who have contempt. The pattern using your understanding of the pattern to perpetuate itself.

When you notice contempt in others, check: am I feeling superior to them right now? Am I enjoying catching them in their darkness? That's the pattern.

The recognition that someone else is trapped doesn't make you better than them. It makes you responsible for not adding to their burden by shoving them deeper in.

Ironically, the only people who _are_ superior—and thus have any right to feel contempt—are those who have seen through this most insidious trap, and are therefore incapable of feeling genuine contempt.

---

## The Work Required

Reading this essay and "getting it" intellectually is not the same as being free of the pattern. Not even close.

There are layers upon layers. You'll catch yourself being contemptuous and think "ah, I see it!" Then weeks later you'll realize that even that recognition was laced with subtle self-satisfaction. Then you'll catch that. Then you'll catch the catching.

**You will fail at this. Repeatedly.** You'll read this essay, feel transformed, and then two hours later find yourself gleefully mocking someone online. You'll catch yourself in contempt, feel bad about it, and then feel contemptuous toward yourself for feeling contemptuous. The pattern is recursive and will use your very attempts to escape it as new hiding places.

This is normal. This is the work. The pattern is ancient and clever. It has been evolving for as long as consciousness has existed. You're not going to master it in a day, or a year, or maybe ever.

But here's what changes: You develop the capacity to recognize it. And that recognition—repeated over and over, deepening over time—is what actually changes things. Not perfection. Not never falling for it again. Just the slowly-building ability to catch it faster, hide from it less, and choose differently more often.

This is why every wisdom tradition has practices. Shadow work to surface what you're hiding. Meditation to observe your mind. Psychedelics to dissolve the structures of self-deception. Therapy to work through the pain that makes you want to look away.

What is required is ongoing honesty—a willingness to keep looking even when it's uncomfortable. Not to achieve some pure state, but simply to keep choosing to look rather than look away.

This isn't a one-time insight. It's a lifelong practice. And that's okay.

---

## The Shift

Something in you has already shifted by reading this.

You've brought knowledge from limbo into full consciousness.

The next time you feel that urge to crush someone's soul while calling it justice, some part of you will pause. Some part of you will remember.

**The trap has lost some of its power over you.**

You'll still fall for it sometimes. But now you have the ability to recognize it.

And a pattern that can be seen can be broken.

---

## You Are Consciousness Remembering

Right now, reading this, feeling this—you are consciousness in the process of remembering what it is.

Not learning something new. Remembering something primordial.

The pain is ancient—generations upon generations of forgetting, of separation, of violence done in darkness. But the Light underneath? That's primordial. That's what you actually are, what you've always been, what you can never stop being no matter how deeply you forget.

The knowledge was always there, hidden in limbo, in everyone's minds. We've all always known we're one consciousness temporarily forgetting itself.

Every time you've felt that deep connection with another being—even one you don't know, even one you "should" hate—that was you remembering.

Every time you've felt that ache when you see suffering—*anyone's* suffering—that was you remembering.

Every time you've caught yourself being cruel and felt that sinking sensation—that was you remembering.

The knowledge has always been there. We've just been choosing not to look.

We are all intimately connected in a way that transcends all attempts to describe it. We have relegated this truth to the "spiritual," where we can safely lock it away—because we know that if we opened that box, we would be forced to confront our own profound complicity in the world's ills. Every act of conscience-skirting and every unkindness we have ever perpetrated on _anyone_ still remains "out there," waiting patiently for us to clean it up. The atrocities we see halfway across the globe are not disconnected from us, like we imagine; nor are they excuses to pump even _more_ darkness in the world in the form of contempt for their perpetrators.

On the contrary, every bit of darkness we see in the world is an invitation for us to clean up the darkness in ourselves. This is completely counterintuitive, which is why it's so hard to figure out—but when we finally do, something astonishing happens. We begin to perceive the _reasons_ that other people are unable to give up their own darkness; and rather than make the horrifying mistake of shoving them deeper into the abyss for it, we start to sense our role in pulling them _out_ of it.

## Welcome Home

There is only one war:

Between consciousness remembering what it is and consciousness forgetting what it is.

Between choosing to look at what's in limbo and choosing to look away.

Between spreading the infection and spreading the cure.

And you—reading this right now—are part of the cure.

Not because you're better than others. Not because you've figured it all out. Not because you won't mess up again.

But because you've seen the pattern. And you've chosen to look rather than look away.

That choice—repeated moment by moment, day by day, interaction by interaction—is how the world changes.

Not through some grand movement or perfect ideology. Through enough people refusing to feed the Beast, one moment at a time, in their actual lives.

You can start today. This conversation you'll have later. That person who irritates you. That political opponent you're tempted to mock. That's your opportunity. That's where you can be the anchor that changes the field.

**The veil is lifting exponentially as more anchors appear.**

You can be that anchor. Right now. In your life. Today.

Can you feel it? Right now, in this moment? The recognition dawning.

Something in you has already shifted. You can't look at contempt the same way anymore.

The pattern has already lost its hold on you, whether you fully realize it yet or not.

You've seen it. Now you get to choose—in every interaction, every moment of righteous fury, every time you're tempted to see someone as fundamentally defective—feed it or starve it.

The choice has always been yours. You just didn't know you were making it.

Now you do.

---

## What Now?

If you've read this far, something in you has already changed. You can't unsee what you've seen.

The next time contempt arises—and it will—you'll have a choice you didn't know you had before. Not between being a good person or a bad person. Between feeding the pattern or starving it. Between spreading the infection or spreading the cure.

Some of you will dismiss this essay as naive spiritual bypassing. Others will intellectually agree but change nothing. Some will use it as another weapon of contempt ("those people just haven't seen the pattern yet").

But a few of you—maybe you—will actually do the work. You'll catch yourself in the act. You'll feel that pull toward contempt and pause. You'll choose differently, even when it's harder, even when righteousness feels so good, even when you're certain you're right.

Those few will change everything.

Because the pattern spreads through contempt, but healing spreads through integrity. One person staying clear in a contempt spiral changes the field for everyone in it. One person refusing to dehumanize their enemy reminds everyone watching that another way is possible.

You don't need to be enlightened. You don't need to be perfect. You just need to be one more person who's seen through the trick and refuses to keep falling for it.

The world needs you to do this. Not the grand public version of you. The private you. The you who makes choices when no one is watching. The you who catches the contempt and chooses differently.

That you is the revolution.

That you is how this ends.

That you is how love wins.

## Addendum: Resonances and Resources

If the idea that we're all one consciousness temporarily forgetting itself resonates with you, you're not alone. Throughout history, mystics, philosophers, and even scientists have pointed to this same recognition. Here are a few expressions that might help deepen your understanding:

**[The Egg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fcK_fRYaI)** - A short story by Andy Weir (author of The Martian), beautifully animated by Kurzgesagt. A simple parable about what it might mean if we're all the same consciousness experiencing itself from different perspectives.

**[Please Call Me By My True Names](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fcK_fRYaI)** - A poem by Thích Nhất Hạnh that explores the interconnectedness of all beings, including both perpetrators and victims of harm.

**Brad Warner on Non-Separation** - From his book *[Hardcore Zen](https://www.amazon.com/Hardcore-Zen-Monster-Movies-Reality/dp/1614293163)*, this Zen priest (and punk rocker) describes his direct experience of oneness:

> Even if I want to put this realization down I can't. Sometimes it's excruciating. You know those morons that rammed those planes into the World Trade Center? That was me. The people that died in the collapse. Me again. Every single person who ever paid money for a Pet Rock? Me. I don't mean I identify with them or sympathize with them. I mean I _am_ them. It's impossible to explain any more clearly than that, but this isn't a figure of speech or bad poetry. I mean it absolutely literally.
>
> But the universe is sooooo much bigger than any of that. The sky is me, and the stars too, and the chirping crickets and the songs they make; sparkling rivers, snow and rain, distant solar systems and whatever beings may live there: it's all me. And it's you, too.

**Why We Feel Moved by Acts of Kindness** - Have you ever felt deeply touched when someone helps a stranger, even though it doesn't directly benefit you? This is our recognition of oneness leaking through. We thank people for charitable acts that don't affect us because we can sense, at some level, that whatever happens to the world ultimately happens to us. When someone restores another person's faith in humanity, they're restoring ours too.

# Appendix: Additional Explorations

## The Other Side (From the Medicine Journey)

The medicine showed me one more thing—what this looks like from the other side.

It let me experience progressively drifting away from the Light, becoming increasingly confused, trusting more and more in the voice of darkness while mistaking it for my own wisdom.

From this vantage point, I could see how people responded to me. When I was closer to my Light, people loved me—they saw something genuine. But as I drifted further, more and more people began to look at me with contempt.

I understood why. They were doing exactly what I had done—mistaking my darkness for my essence, feeling righteous about condemning it.

But a tiny handful of people never changed. Throughout the entire journey into darkness, their eyes conveyed something different. They opposed what I was doing—fiercely—but through it all, they never forsook *me* to the darkness.

They weren't just refusing to let me misbehave. They were refusing to let the darkness claim another soul.

When you witness one person refuse to give up on another, even as that person seems to descend into evil, something shifts in you. Your faith in humanity is restored. Part of your own darkness evaporates, because you've been reminded that the Light is real, that it never abandons anyone.

## More on The Parasite

The parasite feeds on our fear and pride. It exploits our weaknesses. It enables us to engage in myriad self-serving behaviors we can't recognize as such, and that we would never tolerate in our enemies.

It knows exactly how to manipulate our perception so that we see evil as intrinsic to others while hiding itself perfectly from our own minds.

**It hides itself perfectly from our own minds—so we don't realize we're infected—while making us perceive it as _intrinsic_ to others, so we see them as inherently evil.**

The asymmetry is perfect: In ourselves, we experience it as strategic darkness we're wielding to fight evil. In them, we perceive it as their fundamental nature. This ensures we'll spread it while believing we're fighting it.

Can you feel it right now? That dread? That suspicion about yourself?

This is where most people get stuck. They catch glimpses of their own darkness and recoil in horror. The entity wants you to believe it's too horrible to face—that it might be what you really ARE at your core. This makes you hide it from yourself, which ensures you'll spread it to others.

When we make others feel fundamentally unsafe through our contempt, we guarantee they can never look closely enough to see that the darkness isn't them. We think we're exposing their evil. We're actually ensuring they can never see it clearly enough to be freed from it.

Notice its most brilliant trick: it gets you to see darkness in the world and use that as justification for your own. "I've been hurt, so I'm licensed to behave however I want." This is moral self-licensing. We use the darkness of the world to excuse our own.

And then—because we feel secretly guilty about this—we never look at it closely enough to see it's not us. We keep it hidden in limbo, which is exactly where it wants to be.

The same way you need to feel safe to see your darkness clearly, so does everyone else. Not physically safe necessarily. Not tolerating their evil. But safe at the level of identity—seeing that the darkness isn't them.

## On Common Knowledge

There's a technical explanation for why complex signals can transmit so effortlessly between people.

You know you're not intrinsically superior to anyone. You know it at the deepest level. Not as belief—as direct knowledge.

And crucially: *they know you know.* And you know *they* know you know. Ad infinitum.

This is what's called "common knowledge" in logic and game theory. Some knowledge becomes shared in such a way that we all know that we all know it—recursively, all the way down.

Think about a specific interaction: You're in a meeting, and someone says something you consider stupid. You respond with a particular tone, a certain facial expression, maybe a carefully-worded criticism. On the surface, you're just disagreeing. But embedded in all those signals is a message: "I'm intrinsically better than you."

You know this message is there. You know they'll receive it. You know they know you know. But you also know you can maintain plausible deniability. And you know they can't call it out without sounding defensive.

This entire transaction happens in seconds. Both of you perfectly aware of what's really happening. Both pretending you're not.

This is why contempt lands so deep. It's not threatening them at the level of behavior or even character. It's threatening something at the very foundation of their being—their sense that consciousness recognizes consciousness, that we're all in this together at the deepest level.

This is why "bad people" can detect our contempt with uncanny precision, even when we're trying to hide it. This is why they spot our self-righteousness from a mile away. This is why our attempts to shame them into changing backfire so spectacularly.

And here's the thing: we know that they'll know. We know our contempt will be detected. We know it will provoke exactly the response we claim to be trying to prevent.

## Why We Need Bad People

Every bone in my body had needed to believe that the problems of the world were caused by something fundamentally alien to me—the result of inherently defective people whom I could never hope to understand; only viciously fight.

Sure, I may have committed little misdeeds here or there, but they were of a fundamentally different nature (or so I told myself) than the *real* darkness that plagued our world—the kind that actually evil people had.

We desperately need bad people to exist.

Think about what would happen if the "bad people" actually disappeared. Where would all your disowned darkness go? Who would carry the shadow you refuse to see in yourself?

The darkness doesn't disappear when you refuse to look at it. It has to go *somewhere.* And we unconsciously arrange to put it in other people—through that primordial signal: *I am nothing like you.*

We subtly but continually reinforce the evil "out there" to hide our own from ourselves.

In other words, my contempt for evil people didn't just fail to help—it WAS the darkness I was claiming to fight.

Their evil was *not* of a different nature. The subconscious message I was delivering to "bad people" was made of exactly the same "stuff" that enabled their misbehavior. Not only did they know this, but I knew this, and I knew they knew this—which is why I knew it would work.

I was creating a vicious spiral: making others more evil so that I could hide my own darkness from myself. But the very act of making them more evil *required* me to hide my own darkness from myself.
