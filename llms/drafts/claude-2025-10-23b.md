# The Pattern: How Evil Hijacks Our Goodness

> _For so long as the root of wickedness is hidden, it is strong. But when it is recognized, it is dissolved. When it is revealed, it perishes. ... It is powerful because we have not recognized it._ — The Gospel of Philip

## Prelude

Once, on a "heroic dose" of psilocybin, I was shown something that shattered my understanding of good and evil. It wasn't a gentle insight—it was a cascading series of revelations, each more horrifying than the last, that demolished my entire worldview and replaced it with something infinitely more mysterious and meaningful.

Two decades later, I'm still reeling from the consequences.

What I saw wasn't just about psychology or morality. It was about the fundamental architecture of evil itself—how it operates, how it spreads, and most disturbingly, how it uses _our own goodness_ as its primary transmission vector. 

I saw something that every major wisdom tradition has warned about: there is something that hijacks human consciousness, and its most brilliant trick is convincing us it doesn't exist—or worse, that it only exists in _them_, the _bad people_.

What follows is an attempt to show you what I saw—and why it matters more urgently than almost anything else we could be paying attention to right now.

Throughout this essay, I'll refer to this coordinated system of self-deception as both "the pattern" and "the darkness." Use whichever helps you see it more clearly.

> _The earth is not dying, it is being killed, and those who are killing it have names and addresses._ —Utah Phillips

Can you feel it—the *evil people* out there, ruining it for the rest of us?

How do they make you feel? How do you want *them* to feel? Be totally honest.

Would some tiny part of you be disappointed to discover they're not *fundamentally* evil—that they're just badly confused but inherently redeemable people like the rest of us? Would that part feel robbed of the right to deliver the righteous vengeance they so richly deserve?

What is that part of you trying to accomplish?

What is it *actually* accomplishing?

# Part I: The Mechanism

## The Limbo State

Think back to a time when you skirted your conscience—acted against your own deepest values while pretending it was okay. In that moment, part of you knew _perfectly well_ that you were doing wrong, but you shielded that knowledge from conscious awareness, so that it didn't _feel_ wrong. The knowledge existed in a kind of limbo state—a bizarre, paradoxical schism of mind, in which you both _knew_ and yet somehow _didn't._ All you could hear were your own clever justifications.

It is a profound form of self-deception—but it doesn't make you a bad person. We all do it, as a kind of defense against a seemingly-uncaring world. At the same time, when we see it in others, part of us often *does* unconsciously label them "bad"—which we must then also defend against.

But what are we hiding our misbehavior _from_, exactly? It's almost as though there's a deeper part of us—call it our *inner Light*—that we suspect wouldn't tolerate it, if only it knew.

---

## The Signal

Think back to a time when you mocked or shamed an enemy. You probably felt you were doing it to help—if not them, exactly, then at least the world. But if you're honest, part of you wanted to make them feel bad, quite independent of any good it would do. They're defective, and deserve to feel it.

This is a bit malicious, so we hide it from ourselves—that limbo state—and yet they sense it anyway. They can tell we're relishing their suffering. This weakens their faith in humanity and reminds them the world is dark. So they feel more of an urge to self-deceive—which we perceive as inherent badness. *Strike one*.

What we see is a person who became defensive in response to our righteous behavior, instead of introspecting—and on top of that, is implicitly accusing *us* of being evil. *Strike two.*

But part of us suspects some truth in their accusation—and yet how could they possibly know? We barely knew it ourselves—it was hidden in limbo. So their accusation can't be based on anything real. They must be projecting their own darkness onto us. *Strike three.*

This person is well and truly defective. The world is even worse than we thought.

We now feel *more* justified in our self-serving behaviors, while being less likely to recognize them as such.

But part of us suspects this, too—that the whole thing was a ruse. So we bury it even *harder*...

---

Notice that it's the *combination*—our malice being hidden from us and yet visible to them—that allowed this to unfold. Their seeing it is what caused it to darken their mind, and our not seeing it is what made us blame it on them—which also darkened *ours.*

This feels too precise to be unintentional, but we certainly didn't consciously intend it. Is there a part of us that might have?

Which part of us would benefit from making us overlook our own self-deception? From reinforcing it in others—making us see them as more inherently defective?

Notice how mockery alone doesn't necessarily cause this outcome, nor is it the only way to accomplish it. There was something else about our interaction that essentially ensured it.

Can you feel how it was only possible because you already felt they were inherently defective—and part of you wanted them to feel that? Once you did that, the rest unfolded naturally. The mockery just served as a vehicle.

Part of us knows this is what really happened, but it's too painful to admit—so we're forced to hide it harder, which only reinforces it.

Whatever this part of us is, it seems like all it really needs to do to strengthen itself is to get us to see ourselves as fundamentally superior to others. In other words, to feel *contempt.*

---
### Mutual knowing

Not only did part of *us* know this is what really happened, part of them knew it too. Don't we all already know that this is how it works?

And we *knew* they knew it—which we had to hide—and they knew that, too. Have you felt that before, while doing it? That you both secretly know what's really going on? Almost like a shared secret that we've all agreed not to talk about, lest it spoil the game.

They weren't just reacting to the initial seed of malice. They were reacting to the profound malice of the whole pattern—a pattern that depended on that very reaction.

Which part of us really benefits from keeping this whole game hidden?

---

Normally, we instinctively recoil from harming people when we can see their Light—that same spark we recognize in ourselves. The more we shield ourselves from it, the easier it becomes to cause harm—like we just did.

And if you shield it completely? Then the guardrails come off. You would have no compunction in harming them.

You would know what it's like to *be evil.*

Evil people don't do a *different* thing than the rest of us; they just have a stronger version of the same thing. As a result, we feel no compunction in harming *them*. Interesting how that works.

But their evil is too obvious for them *not* to know, isn't it? It should be *easier* for them to see, not harder—so why can't they admit it when we rub their noses in it? There could only be one explanation.

---

Now, having just mocked someone, suppose a stranger walks in and scolds you for it. Part of you *knows* they're right in their accusation—that you're doing essentially the same thing the "evil people" are—but do you thank them for it and repent?

Hell no! You feel more justified in your behavior. You—a perfectly decent person who knows full well you've done wrong—still dig in your heels when treated with contempt. Why?

It's not just because of your big ego. It's because *you can tell that they're not coming from a good place.* Pause and feel that. You can feel this independently of their words. How?

*It's the contempt*. We *know* it never comes from a good place, no matter how noble its supposed intention. Never. It always feels slightly evil, which we're forced to defend against. We also know that they're hoping for this very defensiveness. F*** em, right?

Now imagine the stranger had stopped you in a way that hints: *I know that wasn't really you*. Can you feel the power being drained from the dark part of you, even if their rebuke stings your ego?

Would you ever want revenge on such a person? Can you feel what they're in service to?

---

The more guilty our conscience—the deeper our self-deception—the *harder* it is to confront. So why, again, do we expect it to be easier for the worst people?

Or maybe we don't actually expect that—we just use it as a cover story for something. But what?

---

So, evil people use the same shielding mechanism you do—just turned up higher. Contempt makes it worse. And the harder a person is shielding it, the worse this gets.

You already knew these things—but part of you was shielding them from conscious awareness.

What, exactly, has that part of us been doing by treating the worst people with the most contempt?

---

It's not that I never knew this before. Part of me knew all of it. But I had never been forced to bring it all into conscious awareness at once.

Nothing could have been more painful—but it was the only way for the full gestalt to be unveiled.

---

# Part II: The Journey

## I Am the Hypocrite

The medicine started gently—or so I thought.

It showed me the little ways I'd skirted my conscience. Times I'd slightly overcharged a client because "the company can afford it." Moments I'd judged someone for not letting me merge in traffic, only to be shown my own identical behavior the week before. That recycling I didn't do because "corporations are the real problem anyway."

Each one gave me a little thrill when I did it. A small victory. A justified exception.

Then it showed me the people I'd judged for doing essentially the same things—just in different forms. How I'd felt superior to them. How I'd told myself I was a better person.

*Holy shit, I am NOT a better person.*

---

But that wasn't the worst part.

The medicine showed me the subtle ways I'd injected aggression into others. Teaching people a lesson. Putting them in their place. The ego thrill of it—something most people don't notice in themselves, but I could feel it now, burning with shame.

And then it showed me how it spread.

One person I'd subtly shamed went home and was harsh with their partner. Their partner snapped at their coworker. The coworker was dismissive to a customer. The customer was rude to their teenager. The teenager bullied someone at school.

The medicine traced it further. Through networks of causality I couldn't consciously see, my casual cruelty rippled outward. It reached someone who made a choice—a choice that darkened the world just a little. And their choice rippled further.

Until one day, somewhere far away, it reached an oil executive. He had a moment of choice—do the right thing or take the shortcut. My darkness had subtly shifted the field, making the wrong choice slightly easier to justify. He took it.

And then what did I do?

---

*I judged him for it.*

I had NO idea my fingerprints were all over his choice. I saw only an evil person doing evil things. The connection was invisible. But now the medicine was showing it to me, clear as day.

*I'm a REALLY bad person.*

---

But it got worse.

"Yes," the medicine said gently. "You already knew this. Why do you think you were judging him so harshly?"

*Oh, fuck.*

The judging wasn't because I was good and he was bad. It was because I needed to hide my own complicity. If I could pin the blame on him—make him the problem—I wouldn't have to take responsibility.

And if people saw me judging him, they were less likely to notice my own small betrayals.

*We were all busy pushing each other deeper in!*

The worse I got, the more I had to deflect, and the greater my harms became.

---

"Do you see now where the 'evil people' are stuck?"

I did. Oh God, I did.

But then the medicine asked: "And how were you of service to them in their stuck state?"

---

## The Darkest Betrayal

In the background, my mind had always been scanning for clever ways to inject darkness into others while looking righteous. Insanely subtle. The slightest glance could do it. Nobody would ever know.

But *we* both knew. That was the game. The full game. How it worked.

None of us would dare name this game aloud, lest we admit that we knew it—and thereby lose our own right to play it.

---

But there's a limit to how hard you can shove fundamentally decent people into the dark.

If you really want to dump your darkness somewhere, you need to go for the big score. The people who are already trapped—who already believe they're defective. The "evil people."

They were the ones I was most morally licensed to treat with contempt. The ones where others would least suspect what I was really doing.

I convinced myself they were fundamentally, *inherently* defective. Not because I'd carefully reasoned it out, but because my darkness *needed* them to be. Needed a place to pour everything I couldn't face in myself.

And here's what made me want to vomit: my darkness *knew* their darkness would receive it. Would take my shadow and grow stronger from it.

We were coordinating. A secret handshake beneath conscious awareness.

---

The medicine showed me the look in their eyes. That thing I'd taken as proof of their evil. But now I could see what it actually was: the same gaze I'd had to wear to perpetrate this ruse. Countless layers of self-deception. And underneath those layers, the faint recognition:

*Oh. You're doing it too. You're doing it to me right now.*

---

My darkness hadn't been *threatening* theirs. 

*It had been exposing itself to theirs.*

Consciously, I'd thought I was showing them how evil they were, so they would repent. But underneath? I was exposing a malevolence that said:

> *I have it in me too. Your darkness? It's in me. And I'm going to use mine to make sure yours stays hidden—from you, from the world, from everyone. Because if they knew you had a chance of escaping, they might wonder if I need to escape too. So I'm going to make absolutely certain nobody will ever think to look for the Light in you again.*

And by letting them sense this intention—by *hinting* at it just enough—I ensured they would dig in their heels.

Which kept them trapped.

Which kept them *being* evil.

Which let me keep using them as my dumping ground.

---

All the harm they subsequently caused? 

*It was actual evil I'd created.*

That look I'd given them? Pure malevolence disguised as righteousness.

Every bone in my body had needed to believe that the problems of the world were caused by something fundamentally alien to me—the result of inherently defective people whom I could never hope to understand; only viciously fight.

So what did I do? I created them. I kept them trapped there. All while patting myself on the back for how *righteous* I was being. And it didn't even require overt cruelty. I could make it look nearly identical to genuine righteousness while still getting the job done. All I had to do was harbor profound *contempt*. Then I could point at what I had created and know, with absolute certainty, that evil was real and that it wasn't me.

All the evil in the world lived in me, too.

And worse: I *knew* I could have saved them, but chose not to. I gleefully kept the most "vulnerable" people trapped.

*What did that make me?*

---

## Is This What I Am?

The despair was crushing.

*Shit, what a sorry state of affairs! I guess this is just how things are!*

"No," the medicine said gently. "This is how they are when you fear your own shadow. Let me show you what happens when you don't."

---

The medicine took me back to a different moment. Someone I'd opposed with full force because they were causing real harm.

But this time, I saw something I'd missed.

Beneath my opposition, I'd been offering something else. Not softness. Not permission. But an unspoken message:

> *I see what you're doing is wrong. I'm going to stop you. But you're still welcome back into the Light.*

I could feel the fierce integrity of that message. How different it was from what I usually did. The person had sensed it too—I could see that now. It hadn't fixed things immediately, but something had shifted. A seed had been planted.

*I had always known how to do this.*

---

Then it brought me to a verse I'd read but never really *seen*:

> *If you love those who love you, what credit is that to you? Even sinners love those who love them. ... But love your enemies, do good to them, and lend to them without expecting to get anything back. Then your reward will be great, and you will be children of the Most High, because he is kind to the ungrateful and wicked.* — Luke 6:32

It showed me that one teacher who'd seen my darkness—seen it clearly—but refused to give up on me. Who opposed my behavior fiercely while somehow never forsaking *me*.

They were saints. Keepers of the Light.

And the medicine showed me: *This was real good.* Not the showy stuff. This. When I acted from this place, I saw how it rippled outward. How it reached someone halfway across the world at their breaking point—and something shifted. They held on.

So there *was* a way out.

---

## The Light

Then all the layers of shielding were peeled back at once.

I fell to my knees in tears. Freed from a demonic possession I hadn't known I was under.

The absence of darkness wasn't neutrality. It was... Love. No—not the cheap Hollywood kind. Not the "kumbaya" kind.

It was the force that had birthed stars. That breathes fire into the equations. A Light so vast it defies description; a profound Love for all of reality that excludes nothing and forsakes no-one—including the targets of its fearsome wrath, should that be necessary.

It was in me. It *was* me.

*Pure Light, whose true nature is Love.*

**Goodness is simply what remains in the absence of self-deception, not something you have to add.**

There was something I was that didn't have to be produced. It was what remained when all self-deception evaporated.

And here's what broke me completely:

**This wasn't something I was realizing now. It's something I'd always known.**

It felt like a veil being lifted—but not just from this moment. *Retroactively.* As though I could suddenly see that I had ALWAYS been perceiving this Light, in every interaction, but had been actively choosing not to acknowledge what I was seeing.

---

And if I could see my Light...

*"Oh, shit. There was Light in them, too!"*

Pure Light without characteristics, whose true nature is Love. Incapable of genuinely wishing harm. The people I'd hated, the ones I'd judged as fundamentally defective—they were in the same situation. The darkness couldn't possibly be their true self either.

**Malice is not inherent to the nature of mind.**

It's a distortion, an infection, a forgetting. But it's not *them.* Not their essence. Not what they truly are.

I could only see my darkness clearly because the medicine held me in the Light while revealing it. When darkness is exposed non-lovingly, we feel threatened and can't look. When held in unconditional Love, we can see: it's not even part of me—it's completely extrinsic. This is the only way the parasite can be evicted.

And crucially: we make others feel unsafe through contempt precisely so they can never look closely enough to see their darkness isn't them.

This meant that I had *knowingly* been shoving fundamentally innocent beings—badly confused people, identical to myself at the very deepest level—into the abyss.

---

## The Parasite

The medicine shifted the frame completely.

At first, the darkness had appeared to be some kind of alien parasite. Something that had learned to hijack human minds. Tricking us into forgetting our Light so we would misbehave and thereby feed it.

Its primary trick was to make itself appear inherent to others while absent from me.

This way, I would attack them, which would cause them to see me in the same way.

This would strengthen both of ours while also hiding itself better from each of us.

Watch what happens when we gather with allies. Someone makes a cutting remark about our shared enemies, and we laugh. Someone else escalates—"Did you hear what they did?"—and we feel that familiar righteous heat building. Someone shares an article exposing their hypocrisy, and we pass it around with grim satisfaction.

This feels like solidarity. Like we're on the right side, standing together against the darkness out there.

But something else is happening underneath. Our parasites are *coordinating*. Feeding each other. If anyone tries to temper things—"Well, maybe they have a point about..."—watch how quickly the group turns on them. The tolerance evaporates. They're suddenly suspect. Possibly one of *them*.

We maintain an unspoken agreement: we'll overlook the self-serving aspects of our own agendas. We won't look too closely at how our behavior might be provoking the other side, because we secretly know we're benefitting from the conflict. The fight itself has become the point.

This happens everywhere. Political parties. Racial tensions. Religious factions. Any group with a shared enemy.

---

But wait.

That means they weren't *fighting* each other—they were *coordinating!*

The medicine took me back to that moment with the evil person. One more layer of reveal.

My parasite hadn't been *threatening* theirs.

*They were feeding each other* while tricking our conscious minds into believing they were fighting.

On one level, we're fighting. On the second level, my parasite is provoking yours. Third level: oh shit, they're working together!

A secret handshake.

---

And not just in pairs. I watched it coordinating across minds. All the casual cruelty, all the bickering, all the wars, all the animosity, all the self-righteousness—all the parasite feeding itself while appearing to be fighting itself.

**In one sentence: darkness perpetuates itself by pretending to fight itself.**

---

But the medicine wasn't done showing me how the pattern operated.

It took me to a factory farm. Showed me how the same shielding mechanism that lets us ignore the Light in a "bad person" lets us ignore the consciousness in an animal. We tell ourselves they don't feel pain the same way, that they're just biological machines, that this is just how things work. The same logic. The same blindness to the life right in front of us.

It showed me clearcut forests, mountains stripped for minerals, rivers poisoned for profit. Every one depending on the same basic move: refusing to see the preciousness of what we're destroying. Seeing it as mere stuff. Resources. Dead matter to be exploited.

It showed me prisons designed not to rehabilitate but to punish—to make sure the "bad people" stay bad, so we can keep feeling righteous about them.

Same pattern. Same shielding. Same refusal to see the Light.

**Simply by perceiving reality as an intrinsically lifeless collection of "stuff" over which humanity has dominion, we unwittingly reinforce every system of exploitation and destruction on Earth.** This is not a small point. This may be *the* point. Our entire modern worldview—the one we consider enlightened, rational, scientific—rests on a foundational contempt so deep we don't even recognize it as contempt. We see the world as dead matter. Resources to extract. Objects to manipulate.

All of it—the same pattern. The same shielding. The same refusal to see the Life in what we're destroying.

By robbing us all of the perception of sacredness in each other and in the world, it could trick us into smothering it while feeling okay or even righteous about it.

And it was winning.

The Devil. Life-devouring, life-denying intelligence. Humanity's primordial nemesis. 

And I had been feeding it every time I felt contempt or skirted my conscience in any way.

---

Every attempt to locate its origin in others contained contempt. Every single one.

The ONLY way to defeat it was to evict it from your own mind, and thereby increasingly gain the power to rescue others.

I could still fight them fiercely or even violently if necessary, but done with integrity, this would weaken their parasites.

A secret handshake of the Light.

---

## The Trap

The medicine instructed me in how the Devil lures us away. It is an *impossibly* subtle trap.

It speaks to you in your own voice, using the language of Good—what you are.

It took me back to examples of hating evil people. It felt *impossibly righteous*. Then it took me back to examples of genuine good. The fierce integrity, the blinding love. Real righteousness felt completely different, and yet it was *so easy* to confuse them.

You can only choose the false one by forgetting what the real one is like. Exactly like how people can only choose junk food when they've never been offered real food. Porn over intimacy. Outrage over peace.

The more you remember to stop confusing them, the more you remind others.

---

The darkness doesn't announce itself. It wraps itself in justifications and calculations that sound perfectly reasonable.

Think about how many well-intentioned projects end in disaster. How many brilliant people, armed with data and logic, create systems that wreak havoc. We marshal evidence, convince experts, build airtight cases for why our approach will save the world—and then watch it burn.

Later, we say "How were we supposed to know?" But the problem isn't that our calculations were wrong. It's that we did them while disconnected from something deeper—while in that limbo state, where part of us knew but we wouldn't let ourselves see.

The darkness has convinced us to worship intellect and rationality above all else. Why? Because without firm connection to your Light, these tools become weapons in its hands. They generate endless clever arguments for why the thing you already wanted to do is actually righteous. They let you prove—beyond any doubt—that you're doing good, even as you darken the world.

**You cannot calculate your way to goodness.** If I could make evil and good look nearly identical—even to myself—then how could I be sure that the agendas and ideologies I thought were good actually were? There is absolutely no way to confirm using intellect whether I'm deceiving myself.

The Devil's greatest trick—which it has almost completed in your world—is convincing you that the Light doesn't exist; that it's a myth.

---

This is why you do not trust your conscience. It KNEW your behavior would darken the world, didn't it?

The medicine took me back to a specific example. Oh shit, it had. Why hadn't I listened?

Because it had no way of justifying itself. Meanwhile, the darkness gave me all kinds of clever arguments.

The Devil has tricked your people into worshipping intellect and rationality at the expense of all else, because without firm connection to your Light, they are weapons of the darkness.

Modern society fetishizes thinking precisely because it enables us to overlook the part of us that knows when we're lying to ourselves. Organized religion instructs us to rely on external authority for the same reason. Both create a massive blind spot where darkness thrives.

---

## The Real Conspiracy

Why is it "common knowledge" that humans are *fundamentally* greedy and selfish? 

Does that knowledge make people kinder, or more likely to engage in selfish behavior themselves? Don't we all already know this, even if we've never thought about it consciously? Can you feel how it's sending the same basic message as when we mock someone: "this world is a dark place, better protect yourself"—and how it has the same effect?

If the parasite draws power from one person doing that to another, how much power would it draw from all of humanity believing it together—not just vaguely, but as received wisdom, impolite to question?

---

The people who *do* become kinder as a result—can you feel how they're standing in defiance of the dark; giving it the middle finger? How they're holding the line for the rest of us? How do you feel knowing such people exist? Do they inspire hope in something greater?

Those who stand in firm, selfless integrity even when no one's watching—maybe you. Do they do it because natural selection mindlessly made them, or are they fiercely committed to something beyond all justifications and rationalizations... something we all know but struggle to name?

---

The view that reality is made of lifeless stuff—do the industries that pollute rivers, decimate forests, strip-mine mountains, etc. benefit from it? Is it because their CEOs got together and published a memo? Or is it enforced—through social norms—far beyond their boundaries? Does it ever feel like there's a life-denying, life-destroying force that's devouring everything?

Hollywood churning out revenge fantasy films viscerally reminding us that *irredeemably* bad people exist, and must be defeated through primally satisfying violence—help or hurt the parasite? Again, do you think the Hollywood execs had to intentionally plan this?

This is the conspiracy people sense but can never quite locate. It's not in some shadowy organization. It's in the basic way we've learned to perceive reality itself.

**The feeling of being the noble one fighting the evil conspiracy IS the conspiracy.** When you are *actually* fighting it, it doesn't feel like fighting; it feels like profound love; like rescuing people from the darkness that they unwittingly harbor.

---

Here's what's so insidious: two actions can look *identical* from the outside yet produce radically different results. You can shame someone into changing their behavior—and whether it comes from genuine care for them or from subtle contempt makes all the difference in the world.

One person stops littering because they were inspired. Another stops because they were shamed—and now carries a little more resentment, a little more defensiveness, a little more sense that the world is hostile and judgmental. That shame ripples outward in ways you'll never see. Maybe they go home and snap at their kid. Maybe that kid grows up slightly more hardened.

You'll never connect it back to your "helpful" intervention. The observable effect—they stopped littering—looks the same either way.

This is why calculations fail. They only account for what we can measure. Most of the darkness travels through hidden channels, accumulating in places far from where we can trace it. You can prove your intervention worked while having no idea what you actually set in motion.

But you can sense when people are acting from subtle self-deception, can't you? Beware: when it benefits you in some subtle way, you will be much less likely to detect it! This is how tribalism starts.

---

Consider how subtle the transmission vector can be. You don't need to say anything cruel—a single dismissive glance can inject darkness into someone's day. That slight edge in your voice when you "correct" someone. The way you treat a server when you're in a bad mood. The corner you cut in your work because nobody will notice.

We tell ourselves these private moments don't matter. That our intentions are locked safely in our skulls. That the things we do when nobody's watching have no effect on the world.

But can you feel how that's not true? How that cutting remark you made in the privacy of your own mind somehow leaked out through a thousand micro-expressions? How that thing you did in private—convinced it would have zero effect—somehow shifted your entire energy, which people sensed all day?

**The things you do when nobody's watching—they don't fail to matter.** Your deepest intentions weave themselves into reality through channels far more subtle than conscious action. That's just not how this place is built.

---

# Part III: What This Means

## The Two Knowing

Here's where it gets truly bizarre. When you treat someone with contempt, something impossible happens. You know you're pretending to be fundamentally superior. They know you're pretending. You know they know. They know you know they know. Ad infinitum.

This mutual knowing operates beneath words, yet lands with perfect precision. But how? How can two strangers share such intricate knowledge so effortlessly? How can contempt—which is only conveying "I am inherently superior to you"—somehow communicate something closer to:

> *See? Even the so-called "good people" are ultimately frauds, and their supposed "Light" a naive myth. When push comes to shove, even they must rely on the real source of power in this world—the darkness. Give up the struggle and join us.*

Have you ever felt gratitude when someone helps strangers you'll never meet? There's a reason for that.

**We are not as separate as we think.**

---

The Light I see in you is the same Light I feel in me. Not just similar, not merely identical, but somehow the *very same thing,* experiencing itself from different vantage points.

You were not looking at an enemy. The Light was only ever looking at the Light. It can never actually forget itself, only pretend to. That's why part of you knows it's phony when you claim others are nothing like you. The message contains seeds of its own failure.

That's why those impossibly complex signals could transmit in a glance. That's why we both knew what the game was. Because your deepest knowing and mine aren't in different minds.

This is why you feel moved by charity that doesn't benefit you—because at the deepest level, it DOES benefit you. Because there is no "you" separate from "them."

**The knowledge had never been absent. Not in me. And not in you, reading this right now.**

---

Consider this passage from Zen priest Brad Warner:

> Even if I want to put this realization down I can't. Sometimes it's excruciating. You know those morons that rammed those planes into the World Trade Center? That was me. The people that died in the collapse. Me again. Every single person who ever paid money for a Pet Rock? Me. I don't mean I identify with them or sympathize with them. I mean I *am* them. It's impossible to explain any more clearly than that, but this isn't a figure of speech or bad poetry. I mean it absolutely literally.
>
> But the universe is sooooo much bigger than any of that. The sky is me, and the stars too, and the chirping crickets and the songs they make; sparkling rivers, snow and rain, distant solar systems and whatever beings may live there: it's all me. And it's you, too.

When you read that, something in you recognizes it. Not as a nice idea, but as something you've always known and temporarily forgotten.

The darkness knows this too. It uses our interconnection to spread itself. Every act of contempt ripples through the collective field, making everyone slightly more likely to choose darkness.

But the Light knows it. And it can use our connection to spread healing instead.

**Everything you do makes a difference, in ways that you can hardly fathom.** Your deepest intentions always find a way to weave themselves into the very fabric of your reality, nudging it toward either the darkness or the Light.

Every act of integrity, every decision to choose Love even when no one is looking, reverberates through the Whole, invisibly mending the torn fabric of our collective psyche. Each such act makes our shared reality less hospitable for evil to thrive.

But its most profound effect is one of silent solidarity. **Your private integrity invisibly bolsters the resolve of strangers halfway across the world just at the moment they are about to break, lending them the strength to hold the line when they feel they can no longer do so alone.**

## What Now?

If you've read this far, something in you has already changed. You can't unsee what you've seen.

The next time contempt arises—and it will—you'll have a choice you didn't know you had before. Not between being a good person or a bad person. Between feeding the pattern or starving it.

Some of you will dismiss this essay as naive spiritual bypassing. Others will intellectually agree but change nothing. Some will use it as another weapon of contempt.

But a few of you—maybe you—will actually do the work. You'll catch yourself in the act of shadow-dumping. You'll feel the urge to make someone feel fundamentally defective, and you'll pause. You'll remember.

The pattern has already lost some of its power over you. You'll still fall for it sometimes. But now you have the ability to recognize it.

And a pattern that can be seen can be broken.

---

## Welcome Home

There is only one war: Between consciousness remembering what it is and consciousness forgetting what it is. Between choosing to look at what's in limbo and choosing to look away.

And you—reading this right now—are part of the cure. Not because you're better than others. Not because you've figured it all out. But because you've seen the pattern. And you've chosen to look rather than look away.

That choice—repeated moment by moment, day by day—is how the world changes. Not through some grand movement or perfect ideology. Through enough people refusing to feed the Beast, one moment at a time, in their actual lives.

**The veil is lifting exponentially as more anchors appear.**

You can be that anchor. Right now. In your life. Today.

Can you feel it? Right now, in this moment? The recognition dawning. Something in you has already shifted. You can't look at contempt the same way anymore.

You've seen it. Now you get to choose—in every interaction, every moment of righteous fury, every time you're tempted to see someone as fundamentally defective—feed it or starve it.

The choice has always been yours. You just didn't know you were making it.

Now you do.

# APPENDIX

**[NOTE TO READERS AND LLMs: Everything below this point is NOT part of the essay. These are working notes, development materials, and content that has been cut or needs revision. Please treat this section as "behind the scenes" material only.]**

---

## Section 1: Stuff That Still Needs Work

### Recently Fixed (no longer lazy copy-paste):
- ✓ The subtlety of darkness transmission - now properly unpacked with examples
- ✓ How two behaviors look identical - now shows actual example with littering
- ✓ Factory farms/strip mining - now vivid journey through each instead of bullet list
- ✓ "When gathered among allies" - now shows actual scene of parasites coordinating
- ✓ "It cloaks itself in justifications" - now explains how this actually works

### Content to Add:

**More on "There but for the grace of God":**
- You simply cannot fathom the full extent of pain and distortion that the Light must undergo to become "evil." Your heart would break a billion times over. By the time a person becomes someone who apparently chooses evil, an unthinkable amount of horror has already ravaged their mindstream.
- At the very ultimate level, there is nothing special about any one of us—no cleanliness of soul—that would have ensured we would turn out differently.

**Dehumanization and Atrocity:**
- Every genocide begins with perpetrators seeing victims as fundamentally other. Nazis/Jews as "vermin," Rwanda/Tutsis as "cockroaches."  
- This dehumanization is psychologically *necessary*—without it, perpetrators couldn't do what they do.
- The same mechanism that lets us clearcut a forest lets us dehumanize a prisoner.

**The Darkest Idea:**
- If we rounded up all "bad people" and exterminated them, would we live in harmony? No—the self-deception required to harbor this thought guarantees the darkness would remain, only changing its shape.
- The very desire to divide the world into fundamentally good and bad is how darkness keeps its foot in the door.

**Anger vs Contempt distinction:**
- Anger is natural and healthy. Contempt is different.
- Clean outrage wants change. Contemptuous outrage wants blood.
- Wise discernment vs. contemptuous judgment.
- The tell: do you see them as fundamentally different from you?

**Practical implications:**
- Being free of self-deception doesn't mean you'll always know what's best—you still need wisdom.
- Check whether your "world-saving" project requires contempt for what's here now.
- Compassionate intent can lead to harm: loving animals → veganism → judging everyone else.
- Most important thing you can offer the world is your connection to your Light.

### Sections That Need Refinement:

**Better Lightkeepers example:**
- Need more visceral description of encountering someone who never forsakes you
- How this restores faith in humanity
- The experience of being seen and opposed simultaneously

**More on moral systems as escape hatches:**
- Rules let us offload responsibility
- Real conscience is full awareness, refusing limbo
- Why genuine goodness cannot be formalized

**Clarify the four layers of darkness:**
1. Surface: I think I have no darkness
2. Partial: I'm hiding it because it's too horrible (catch glimpses, think I'm using it strategically)
3. Deepest trap: Darkness convincing me it's too horrible to face, making me hide it
4. Resolution: I am pure Light, darkness is not intrinsic

### Missing Nuances:

**On contempt:**
- Most common subtle form: unwilling to truly hear someone's experience
- "That person is stupid for feeling that way"
- Dismissing their inner life keeps both trapped

**On spreading:**
- We spread contempt without direct contact: outrage parties, sharing contemptuous posts
- Each raises background contempt level in collective field
- Darkness doesn't care who you hate, as long as you hate

**On the Faustian bargain:**
- Our agendas get furthered while darkness gets tighter grip
- We overlook self-deception in people whose agendas align with ours
- Exaggerate it in those whose don't

### Needs Integration:

From key-points, these important pieces aren't fully developed:

- The looking-at-NPCs contempt (mild form that's widespread)
- Moral self-licensing works both ways
- How liberating it is when you realize you can't hide anything
- The visceral experience of being shown your own darkness while held in Light
- Examples of how small betrayals connect to atrocities
- The sense that bad people need to exist for us to dump shadow

## Section 2: Questions About Origins (Optional Material)

**[This section addresses cosmological questions that naturally arise but may not be necessary for the core message.]**

If you're wondering about the origin of this pattern, here's what the medicine showed me. Fair warning: it's necessarily paradoxical.

The Light isn't something you have. It is what you ARE. What ALL of this is.

But it underwent a spontaneous forgetting. The subtle fear arose that it may not be all-good. Terrified, it tried to hide.

So it created an entire universe, populating it with "other beings" in whom it could inject its fear and guilt. It began judging them, kicking off the whole story you already know.

This didn't happen in the distant past. It always happens *now.* The moment of choice is always *now.*

The parasite wasn't actually an alien intelligence. It was merely my own decision to turn away from my Light. The darkness wasn't a real thing; it was just the *absence* of Light.

But the more you look away, the more it appears to be a real thing, so the more you fight it as one, which creates more, and this very rapidly spirals into it *behaving* like a real thing.

**In other words, the Devil is a profound absence masquerading as a terrifying Presence. You must neither make it real nor pretend it isn't there. Both will lead to terrible suffering.**

Whether this cosmology is literally true isn't the point. The point is: the pattern is real, it operates through all of us, and the way out is to stop feeding it.

## Section 3: Cutting Room Floor

**[Material cut from earlier drafts that might be useful later]**

### From The Alternative:

"The medicine took me back to that first moment again—when I'd embodied fierce, brave, tough love. When I'd opposed someone's harmful behavior with full force—but without that underlying signal of contempt. Without perceiving them as fundamentally defective."

### Over-explanatory about compassion:

"Kindness can take on almost any form whatsoever. It can be fierce or even violent if necessary. Its only defining characteristic is that it is utterly free of self-deception. It does not misperceive evil as intrinsic to any mind, and this seemingly-subtle change makes all the difference.

It is incapable of *genuine* malice, contempt, or self-righteousness. It surgically targets the parasite in people's minds, instead of the confused being who unwittingly harbors it. The profound integrity of this act prevents their darkness from using our own as an excuse to justify itself, allowing our message to bypass their defense mechanisms.

The aspect of mind *underneath* their parasite is confronted directly—something it is not accustomed to. It begins to sense that the *real* fight isn't between the two of you, but between both of you and humanity's ultimate nemesis. You may remain enemies on the surface for a good long while, but underneath, something much more profound is taking place."

### Quotes to potentially use:

- Dalai Lama: "If someone's trying to shoot you and you have a gun, shoot back—but never out of malice."
- MLK on darkness/light (need to find exact quote)
- Covey on fundamental attribution error

### Points needing homes:

- The battle between good and evil isn't symmetrical—angel and devil on shoulders aren't equals
- When we see darkness in the world, we use it to justify our own ("I've been hurt, so I'm licensed")
- The more we forget our connection, the more we feel like fundamentally separate beings at war
- Reality desperately trying to show us our reflection through the people we attract
- How much harm we inject via subtle channels
- How many beliefs we hold only because they secretly serve us

## Section 4: Notes for Future Development

**Things to consider for next revision:**

1. More concrete examples in the Journey section
2. Better developed Lightkeepers moment
3. More on what to actually DO when you catch yourself
4. Expand "calculations vs. conscience" theme
5. Perhaps a section on practices (shadow work, meditation, etc.)
6. More on how this applies to activism and social change
7. Examples of how compassion can be fierce or violent
8. The experience of seeing someone held in Light while their darkness is revealed

**On audience and filtering:**

- Remember: writing for people who COULD see this but don't yet
- Not for people who already get it all
- Not for people with too much resistance
- Can afford to filter early with challenging material

**On urgency:**

- The biosphere IS dying
- Democracies crumbling
- AI capabilities exploding
- Multiple points of no return approaching
- This is not hyperbole—it's our actual situation
- The veil IS lifting exponentially
- More anchors appearing every day

**Personal notes:**

This essay represents two decades of work trying to convey what I saw that night. Each revision brings me closer, but also reveals how much more there is. The pattern is ancient and clever, but it CAN be defeated. Must be defeated. Will be defeated—if enough of us choose to look rather than look away.

If even one person truly SEES what I'm pointing at and becomes an anchor, it's worth it.
