# The Pattern

> _For so long as the root of wickedness is hidden, it is strong. But when it is recognized, it is dissolved. When it is revealed, it perishes. ... It is powerful because we have not recognized it._ â€” The Gospel of Philip

## Prelude

Once, on a "heroic dose" of psilocybin, I was shown something that shattered my understanding of good and evil. It wasn't a gentle insightâ€”it was a cascading series of revelations, each more horrifying than the last, that demolished my entire worldview and replaced it with something infinitely more mysterious and meaningful.

Two decades later, I'm still reeling from the consequences.

What I saw wasn't just about psychology or morality. It was about the fundamental architecture of evil itselfâ€”how it operates, how it spreads, and most disturbingly, how it uses _our own goodness_ as its primary transmission vector. By the end of that night, I understood why every major wisdom tradition has warned about the same thing, using different metaphors: there is something that hijacks human consciousness, and its most brilliant trick is convincing us it doesn't exist.

I saw how some of civilization's core assumptionsâ€”that hating bad people is good; that reality is composed of fundamentally inert matter; that rational thought is our only reliable guideâ€”were themselves vectors of the very darkness we claim to oppose. Not accidental side effects, but essential components of how it spreads.

What follows is an attempt to show you what I sawâ€”and why it matters more urgently than almost anything else we could be paying attention to right now.

By necessity, I'll convey some of this in poetic terms; but there's also a technical component, which may help digest it for those whose minds work like mine. Of course, take everything I say with a grain of saltâ€”it was a psychedelic trip, after allâ€”but also, integral to the insight was that you already know everything I'm about to tell you, whoever you are. You _must_â€”because at the deepest level, I am you. But I'm getting ahead of myself.

A word about audience: if you need peer-reviewed studies before considering that consciousness might work differently than materialist assumptions suggest, this essay probably isn't for youâ€”at least not yet. But if you've sensed something like this yourself, or if the way we collectively relate to "evil people" has started to feel deeply wrong in ways you can't quite articulate, then read on. This is an attempt to give language to something you may already know.

Throughout this essay, I'll refer to this coordinated system of self-deception as both "the pattern" and "the darkness"â€”they're the same thing. The pattern is how it operates; the darkness is what it does to reality. Use whichever helps you see it more clearly.

# Part I: The Mechanism

## The Limbo State

Think back to a time when you skirted your conscienceâ€”acted against your own deepest values while pretending it was okay. In that moment, part of you knew _perfectly well_ that you were doing wrong, but you shielded that knowledge from conscious awareness, so that it didn't _feel_ wrong. All you could hear were your own clever justifications. Knowledge of your wrongdoing existed in a kind of limbo state, in which you simultaneously _knew_ and yet somehow _didn't._

It's a hidden trick of the mind that lets us cause harm while feeling justified. But why do we have to hide it? What are we hiding it _from_, exactly?

There's a deeper part of usâ€”call it our inner Light, our core awarenessâ€”that wouldn't tolerate it, if only it knew. And here's something curious: we use the word "right" to mean both "correct" and "good." This isn't an accident. Something in you knows that what is good is what is most correctâ€”that this deeper knowing is a more reliable guide than your cleverest justifications.

Here's what I was shown: this limbo stateâ€”a kind of self-deceptionâ€”is the secret mechanism behind *all the evil there ever was.* Even the worst person can only cause harm by shielding their minds from perceiving the _life_ in their victimsâ€”that spark that would remind them of themselvesâ€”using exactly the same trick.

Hating people for being evil feels righteous, but it only reinforces their capacity for self-deceptionâ€”that is, makes them *more* evil.

Let me show you how this works, starting with something we can all relate to.

---

## Mockery

This trick plays out everywhereâ€”in the grand and in the mundane. Start with something simple.

Think back to a time when you mocked someone for being stupid, crazy, or evil. Maybe online, or even in person. You may have convinced yourself it was for the greater goodâ€”that it would shut them up, or make them realize how crazy they are.

But if you're honest, part of you *wanted* them to double down, so that your mockery would be justified.

And they probably didâ€”but crucially, *not because of the mockery itself*. It was because of a hidden signal embedded in it, that conveyed something like: *you are fundamentally defective.* This made them perceive *you* as slightly evil, which they felt a natural urge to resist. Why would they give evil the satisfaction? This made them see the world as a slightly darker place, likely reinforcing their need to self-deceive for protection.

Of course to you, it felt nothing like evil, and so their implicit accusation just confirmed your perception of them: they are, indeed, defective. Mission accomplished: mockery justified.

But here's the thing: the only way you could have executed this plan was by entering the limbo state yourselfâ€”the very origin of evilâ€”and so they weren't entirely wrong. Part of you had to know that you were pushing a fellow human deeper into the abyssâ€”the place that necessitates our self-deceptionâ€”for your own benefit. That is why you had to hide it from yourself.

It's as if by engaging in self-deception, you invited them to engage in it, tooâ€”almost like that state is... *infectious*.

---

## From Mockery to Contempt

Mockery is an easy example because for most people we mock, it's not hard to believe they're fundamentally like usâ€”that they have an inner Light. Therefore, it's easy to recognize how digging in their heels may be the result of us nudging them away from it.

But beyond a certain point, people seem... evil. When we treat them as such, and they entrench, we see it totally differently. It just serves as more proof that they *have* no Light.

To make this more concrete, bring to mind someone you consider genuinely *evil.* Can you imagine giving them a cold stare meant to convey that fact? It feels *righteous*â€”as if you're letting them know that their evil won't be tolerated.

But you're *not* just telling them their evil won't be tolerated. You're communicating that *they themselves* are inherently defectiveâ€”fundamentally unworthy of love, or really anything but pain.

Now here's where contempt gets subtle. You may not consciously think "I'm better than them" or "they're worthless." It's more like a vague sense of moral superiority. A background hum that says "I would never" or "they're just... different." But they receive it as a primal threatâ€”a kind of dark challenge they'll gladly meet with their own darkness.

And here's the crucial insight: deep down, we *know* this distinction. We know there's a way of opposing evilâ€”fiercely, even violently, of *hating their behavior*â€”without forsaking the being who's engaging in it. We know this sends a drastically different message. But these two forms of oppositionâ€”"I won't let you do this" vs "I'm going to crush your very soul"â€”can be made to look nearly identical from the outside. So we know nobody can blame us if we pick the "wrong one."

Let that sit for a moment, because what's coming next is intense.

---

## The Hidden Knowledge

Not only can nobody *else* blame us if we make the wrong choice; we will not even blame ourselves.

Here's what the pattern depends on: we *know* the two forms of opposition send different signals, and we *know* which is which. But we also know that we can make them look similar enough on the surface that we can pretendâ€”*even to ourselves*â€”that we don't see the difference. That we took the high road when we really didn't.

This was breathtaking to witness. It's the mechanism by which we can knowingly shove people deeper into darkness while *genuinely believing* we were offering them a way out.

We know it won't help. Deep down, we know it won't. We always know. But because we can always convince ourselves that we didn't knowâ€”that we *really thought* shame would helpâ€”we're willing to lie to ourselves.

And once you see this clearly, you realize something even more horrifying.

---

## All The Evil There Ever Was

The CEO knowingly polluting rivers, the politician starting wars on false pretenses, the billionaire hoarding wealth while people starveâ€”they all operate through precisely this mechanism.

Part of them knows. Always. The knowledge exists in their limbo state. They could choose to examine it. But they generate justifications that let them avoid it: "Everyone does it." "It's for the greater good." "I'll use my power for good once I have enough."

Think about the Nazi who convinced himself Jews weren't really human. The knowledge that they *were* human existed in his limbo state. He could have examined it. He chose not to.

Think about the person who burns a child to clear land for logging. Some part of them knows. Has to know. But they've learned to not look.

**This mechanismâ€”and only this mechanismâ€”is what enables every atrocity.** Not monsters. Not people fundamentally different from you. Just humans who've learned to hide knowledge from themselves while appearing righteous.

And here's what broke me wide open: *I was using the exact same mechanism.*

---

## The Medicine Journey

On that trip, the medicine took me on a journey through my own darkness. It showed me specific times I'd radiated contempt at people I considered evil, convinced I was righteously opposing them.

And this time, I couldn't hide from what was in my limbo state.

### Depth 1: I Was Making Them Worse

The first thing I saw: when I mocked or shamed these people, they didn't change. They dug in their heels. Got more extreme. More defensive. More entrenched.

I'd always told myself: "Well, that's because they're fundamentally defective. My behavior exposed the evil that was already there."

But then the floor dropped out.

**I saw that I was trying to make them worse.**

Not accidentally making them worse while trying to help. *Actively trying.* Part of me wanted them to dig in their heels, to double down, to become more evilâ€”because then I could feel even more self-righteous fury, the most intoxicating feeling in existence.

I was taken back to specific moments, and shown exactly where in my mind this knowledge had existed. As hard as I mentally squirmed and wriggled, there was no denying it: I was making them more evil.

---

### Depth 2: I Wanted This Outcome

But why would I want to make them worse?

The medicine took me deeper.

I saw that part of me desperately *wanted* them to make the wrong choice. Because there was nothing more viscerally satisfying than watching evil be violently punished. And that satisfaction felt *righteous.* It felt like proof I was good.

The surface story: *I'm giving them one final chance to repent. If they don't take it, I'll know everything I need.*

But underneath? I *needed* them to fail. Because I needed proof that they were irredeemable. Because that proof would license me to unleash my darkness on them while calling it justice.

---

### Depth 3: I Engineered It

And then the medicine showed me something even more horrifying.

This part of me couldn't just leave their response to chance. It needed to *ensure* they would make the wrong choice.

But how could I force someone to embrace their darkness without giving away what I was doing? Even to myself?

The solution was brilliant in its cruelty: I would pretend to offer them a genuine path back while secretly sealing off all the exits. I would make my "olive branch" and my "poisoned olive branch" look almost identicalâ€”so identical that even my own conscious mind couldn't tell the difference.

I found that I could craft a message that would reliably trigger their worst impulses while giving me complete plausible deniability.

*"Sorry, I was only trying to help!"*

The crazy part is that this shove was accomplished by merely telegraphing my intention to execute itâ€”knowing they would receive the signal, knowing they would react to it, knowing I could claim ignorance.

My overt behavior appeared to be righteously combating their evil. But underneath, I was conveying something far more sinister:

*"I don't care if you really do have something good buried under unthinkable pain. I'm going to smother it so thoroughly that nobody ever thinks to ask whether you have it."*

---

### Depth 4: We Share The Same Mechanism

And then I saw something that broke me completely.

To shove them deeper into that plausible deniability, I had to enter it myself. To push them into the limbo stateâ€”where they hide knowledge from themselvesâ€”I had to enter that exact same limbo state.

Think about what this means.

They can only cause harm by using this mechanismâ€”hiding knowledge, generating rationalizations, choosing not to look. And to push *them* deeper into it, I had to use that identical mechanism.

We're both hiding from the same thing. Both using the same trick. Both capable of the same self-deception.

---

### Depth 5: I Could Always See Their Light

*"And what else?"* the medicine nudged, relentless.

I was taken to the deepest layer.

I saw that underneath their darknessâ€”underneath all that self-deception and rationalization and harmâ€”was something pure. Something confused. Something *reachable*.

I had always been able to perceive this. Not as a belief or a hope, but as direct perception.

*This isn't something you're realizing now,* it showed me. *It's something you've always known. LOOK.*

The veil was lifted retroactively. I *had* always seen it.

Pure Light. Whose true nature is Love. Incapable of genuinely wishing harm.

The actual message I'd been conveying was:

*"We both know I can see your Lightâ€”that your evil is a distorted cry for help. We both know I could lead you back toward it. But no one can prove I knew thatâ€”not even meâ€”so no one will blame me when I snuff it out. Yet we both know, deep down, what I've done."*

This wasn't just dark. It was pure malevolenceâ€”the very essence of evil.

I wasn't making a fundamentally defective person worse. I was knowingly shoving fundamentally innocent beingsâ€”badly confused people, identical to myself at the very deepest levelâ€”deeper into the abyss.

---

### Depth 6: The Liberation

And the moment you see it clearlyâ€”the moment this knowledge floods from limbo state into full consciousnessâ€”something shifts at a fundamental level.

It feels very much like being freed from a demonic possession.

What I'd thought was "me"â€”the hatred, the contempt, the urge to crush evilâ€”was actually a structure of self-deception masquerading as my identity. A parasite that had learned to think my thoughts and feel my feelings so convincingly that I'd mistaken it for myself.

**"Ohâ€”this is not me."**

All those depictions of the angel and devil on our shoulders were almost right. Except the angel isn't some external guideâ€”it's your true nature, what you actually *are*. And the devil isn't an equal opposing forceâ€”it's a parasite that can be evicted. They're not peers locked in eternal struggle. One is intrinsic, the other extrinsic.

And then came the second revelation:

**"Ohâ€”this is not them either."**

The people I'd hated, the ones I'd judged as fundamentally defectiveâ€”they were in the same situation. The darkness couldn't possibly be their true self. Malice is not inherent to the nature of mindâ€”just as the Buddhists have always said. It's a distortion, an infection, a forgetting. Not who they are.

The message was clear: *This is how it is possible for someone whose true nature is infinite Loveâ€”YOUâ€”to commit great evil. This is exactly how you do it. This is exactly the same way they do it.*

---

## Part II: The Universal Pattern

### It's Not Just Me

Every harmful act in historyâ€”from the smallest unkindness to the worst atrocitiesâ€”has been enabled by this same mechanism:

1. Knowledge exists that the action is harmful
2. That knowledge sits in the limbo state
3. We choose not to examine it
4. We generate justifications that feel righteous
5. We act while hiding the true motivation from ourselves

The CEO who ignores environmental harm tells themselves they're just doing their job. The politician who lies tells themselves everyone lies. The citizen who looks away tells themselves they're just one person.

Everyone has good reasons. Everyone is just responding to the world as it is.

But here's where it gets stranger.

---

### Why We Fetishize Rationality

Our culture has convinced itself that rational thought is our only reliable guide. This seems like wisdom, but it's actually the pattern's most brilliant trick.

Because it's precisely by convincing us that conscious reasoning is the only valid way of knowing that the pattern gets to operate beneath our awareness, hidden in the limbo state.

We dismiss the part of us that could actually detect when we're being self-serving as "just feelings" or "woo-woo intuition." We relegate it to religion or mysticism, safely quarantined from "serious" decision-making.

This gives the pattern carte blanche to operate. We never notice how many of our thoughts are merely rationalizations, because we've abandoned the one faculty that can tell the differenceâ€”that inner Light that knows when our behavior will brighten or darken the world.

How could there be a part of you that knows when your behavior will harm others, when you yourself can *prove* with logic that it won't? There couldn't beâ€”and you can prove it!

This is the perfect trap. The pattern convinces you that rational thought is supreme, then uses that very rationality to justify actions your deeper knowing recognizes as harmful.

**You cannot calculate your way to goodness.** The reason being that you'll never know whether your calculation is based on self-deceptionâ€”in the same way you calculated that mocking and shaming your enemies would bring benefit to the world.

---

### The Secret Alliance

All of our self-deceptions coordinate with each other.

When you project contempt at someone, your darkness and theirs recognize each other. On the surface you're enemies, but underneath, you're *helping each other* maintain your delusions.

You give them evidence they're being persecuted by self-righteous hypocrites. They give you evidence they're irredeemable. Both of you get to avoid examining your own darkness while feeling noble about fighting the other's.

The pattern spreads like this: you reinforce their darkness, they reinforce yours, your respective tribes see this and feel more justified, and the cycle accelerates. Each person creating exactly the conditions that justify their behavior.

This is the secret handshakeâ€”your darkness and theirs, coordinating beneath conscious awareness.

---

### We Need Bad People

And here's something even more disturbing:

**We desperately need bad people to exist.**

Not in some abstract sense. We have a visceral, almost desperate *need* for them.

Think about what would happen if the "bad people" actually disappeared. Where would all your disowned darkness go? Who would carry the shadow you refuse to see in yourself?

The darkness doesn't disappear when you refuse to look at it. It has to go *somewhere.* And we unconsciously arrange to put it in other peopleâ€”through the precise mechanism of contempt.

Bring to mind someone whose behavior genuinely horrifies you. Now imagine you hear credible evidence they've genuinely changed. Recognized their errors. Made amends.

Feel the resistance? The skepticism? The slight *disappointment*?

That's the tell. Because hating them is how you know you're good. Judging them is how you prove you're better. Fighting them is how you avoid fighting the darkness in yourself.

As long as we feel like "good people," we believe in the existence of inherently "bad people," which justifies us harboring contempt somewhere in our minds. This is how the darkness keeps its foot in the door.

---

### The Two Mirrors

*(This section gets a bit technicalâ€”feel free to skip to the next section if it doesn't resonate.)*

Here's where the technical part comes in.

You know you're not intrinsically superior to anyone. You know it at the deepest level. Not as beliefâ€”as direct knowledge.

And crucially: *they know you know.* And you know *they* know you know. Ad infinitum.

This isn't mystical. It's what's called "common knowledge" in logic and game theory. Some knowledge becomes shared in such a way that we all know that we all know itâ€”recursively, all the way down.

But there's another dimension to this, a kind of horizontal recursion: I know that I'm hiding my pretense of superiority. And I know that this very act of hiding sharpens the signalâ€”makes it land even deeper. And I know that I'll get away with this because you can't prove I knew I was hiding it. And I know that knowing I'll get away with it makes the whole thing even more vicious. Each layer of hiding conceals another layer of knowing, like nested dolls of self-deception.

When you hold someone in contemptâ€”perceiving them as fundamentally defectiveâ€”you're violating something you both know, in ways that you know you're violating it. You're pretending to an authority you don't have. And they receive this pretense perfectly through a thousand subtle signalsâ€”precisely because you're both trying to hide and signal it simultaneously.

Your contempt doesn't just say "your behavior is wrong." It says "I'm intrinsically better than you, and we both know that's a lie, and we both know that I know it's a lie, but I'm going to act on it anywayâ€”and hide that I'm hiding that I'm hiding it."

**This is why contempt lands so deep.** It's not threatening them at the level of behavior or even character. It's threatening something at the very foundation of their beingâ€”their sense that consciousness recognizes consciousness, that we're all in this together at the deepest level.

And when you threaten them at that level, you're not attacking their darkness. You're attacking the very Light in them that could recognize its own darkness.

This is why "bad people" can detect our contempt with uncanny precision, even when we're trying to hide it. This is why they can spot our self-righteousness from a mile away. This is why our attempts to shame them into changing backfire so spectacularly.

Not because they're uniquely sensitive or defensive. Because *all* humans can detect this violation of common knowledge. We all know when someone is pretending to an authority they don't have.

And here's the thing: we know that they'll know. We know our contempt will be detected. We know it will provoke exactly the response we claim to be trying to prevent.

**We know it won't work. We always know.**

---

### Why Common Knowledge Exists

But waitâ€”why should this be possible at all? Why should we be able to share knowledge so precisely, especially with complete strangers?

The answer points to something even stranger.

At the deepest level, your mind and theirs aren't truly separate.

I know how this sounds. But look at what it explains:

The limbo state is where we forget what we are. Common knowledge works because we're not actually separateâ€”your deepest knowing and theirs aren't in different minds. The pattern coordinates across billions of people because it's fragmenting one consciousness against itself.

This is why your innermost intentions weave themselves into reality through those subtle channels. This is why even choices no one will see reverberate through what unfolds. Because at the deepest level, there's only one consciousness here, choosing in each moment to remember or forget what it is.

But I'm getting ahead of myself. Let's stay with what we can observe directly.

---

### The Distributed Malevolent Entity

All of our parasites together behave like a distributed malevolent entity, manipulating all of humanity from beneath our conscious thresholds.

The Christians know it as the Devil, and the Buddhists call it the ego. You can treat this as a metaphor, but it is also as real as anything you can touch.

It is why some people believe in the existence of an evil global conspiracy pulling the strings from behind the scenes. It is the *primordial* evil conspiracy; the one to which all the rest owe their existence, and to which they all ultimately filter up.

On the surface, we and they may be enemies, but under the covers, our darkness is secretly allied. This is the trick by which the darkness spreads nearly unchecked, getting each of us to strengthen it while flawlessly convinced that we're fighting it.

**The feeling of being the noble one fighting the evil conspiracy IS the conspiracy.** When you are *actually* fighting it, it doesn't feel like fighting; it feels like profound love; like rescuing people from the darkness that they unwittingly harborâ€”even when it is entirely "witting."

This is perhaps the single most important thing to understand: that righteous feeling, that sense of being the hero battling the forces of darkness? That's not your Light. That's the pattern using your Light's energy while posing as it.

When you're actually operating from your Light, it feels completely different. More like grief than glory. More like heartbreak than heroism.

---

### The Worldview Contempt

But the pattern operates at an even deeper level than contempt for specific people.

**Simply by perceiving reality as an intrinsically lifeless collection of "stuff" over which humanity has dominion, we unwittingly reinforce every system of exploitation and destruction on Earth.**

This is not a small point. This may be *the* point.

Our entire modern worldviewâ€”the one we consider enlightened, rational, scientificâ€”rests on a foundational contempt so deep we don't even recognize it as contempt. We see the world as dead matter. Resources to extract. Objects to manipulate. A mechanical universe of purposeless atoms following meaningless laws.

And once you see the world this wayâ€”once you see forests as timber, animals as meat, rivers as waste disposal, even other humans as NPCs in your storyâ€”every atrocity becomes possible.

This worldview permits corporations to plunder nature for profit. It permits factory farms to brutalize helpless creatures. It permits prisons to dehumanize inmates in ways that guarantee recidivism. It permits governments to send our young off to wars that only enrich the pockets of the rich.

The devastation we see in the world is literally a mirror image of the sickness within. **The collapse of the biosphere IS our self-deception externalized.**

Once you genuinely see thisâ€”once you see how the pattern of contempt extends from individual relationships all the way to our relationship with reality itselfâ€”you can't unsee it.

---

### The Darkest Idea

The darkest idea of all is that if we were to round up all the "bad people" and exterminate them, the rest of us would live in harmony.

The very self-deception required to harbor this thought guarantees that the darkness would remain behind, in full force; changing only its shape.

The very desire to divide the world into the fundamentally good and bad; those who deserve our compassion and those who deserve our contempt, is how our darkness keeps its foot in the door, biding its time, waiting for the right conditions, so that it may manifest as full-blown evil.

This is the root cause of every atrocity that has ever been committed.

The Nazis referred to Jews as "vermin." During the genocide in Rwanda, Tutsis were called "cockroaches." This is a common pattern throughout historyâ€”and it always begins with perceiving certain people as fundamentally defective.

Perhaps paradoxically, the only way to be sure you'd never do such a thing is that you don't feel contempt for the people who have.

---

## Part III: Breaking Free

### Anger vs. Contempt

Now here's something crucial that's easy to miss:

Anger is a completely natural, and even healthy, response to harmful behavior. But it is almost always accompanied by malice, contempt, or self-righteousness. These may feel healthy, too, but they are only manifestations of our parasite.

The darkness tricks us into closing our hearts precisely when they are needed the most.

If judgment means wise discernment, it's helpful. It's contemptuous judgment that's the problem. Same with outrage. At one level these are easy to confuse, but at a deeper level the distinction is obvious. It's only our darkness that makes it feel hard.

You can be absolutely enraged at someone's behavior while still seeing their Light. You can oppose them with every fiber of your being while refusing to forsake the consciousness looking out through their eyes.

This is what it means to hate the sin but love the sinnerâ€”though even that phrase has been corrupted by the pattern, used to justify contempt while pretending to compassion.

---

### Fierce Compassion

This is fierce compassion. And the crucial difference is this: when you act from it, you never lose sight of what you're actually doing. You never mistake violence for righteousness. You never forget you're acting out of tragic necessity, not noble crusade.

When you operate from contempt, you're trying to destroy the host, convinced that the pattern and host are one. Your enemy feels this through a thousand subtle cuesâ€”your tone, microexpressions, the words you choose. Their own pattern recognizes yours and uses it as justification. "See?" it whispers to them. "Even the 'good people' are frauds. Darkness is the only real power."

But when you're operating from genuine compassionâ€”when you see through the illusion that evil is intrinsic to their mindâ€”something different happens. Your actions become infused with a different intention, and that intention transmits through all those same subtle channels.

You're no longer whispering "you are the darkness." You're saying "I see that you've been colonized by this pattern, and I will not collude with it by pretending it's who you really are."

This bypasses their defenses in a way that contempt never can. The part of them underneath the patternâ€”the part that's still made of Light, even if they've forgotten itâ€”suddenly finds itself being addressed directly. Something in them recognizes something in you. And for a moment, the real war becomes visible: not between the two of you, but between both of you and humanity's true enemy.

You may remain surface enemies for a long while. You may still need to fight them, stop them, even harm them if they're causing harm to others. But underneath, something has shifted. The pattern can no longer use your interaction to strengthen itself.

**The feeling of being a noble warrior fighting the evil conspiracy? *That's* the conspiracy.** When you're actually opposing the pattern, it doesn't feel like righteous battle. It feels like grief. Like profound love. Like rescuing people from something that has everyone trapped.

---

### How to Expose Darkness

Here's something crucial about how this essay worksâ€”about how any real transformation works:

We try to expose people's darkness violently, through contempt and shame. We think we're rubbing their noses in it, forcing them to see. But that approach only drives the darkness deeper.

The way that actually works is compassionatelyâ€”though not necessarily nicely. 

The medicine journey I described was fierce and unrelenting. It didn't let me hide from anything. It showed me that I was actively making people worse, that I wanted them to fail, that I engineered their descentâ€”each revelation more horrifying than the last. But here's what made it transformative rather than traumatic: every exposure of my darkness was held within an unwavering recognition of my Light. 

The medicine never said "you're a terrible person." It said "look at what's happening in you"â€”and simultaneouslyâ€”"look at what you actually are underneath it." It showed me I wasn't the parasite. It showed me the parasite wasn't intrinsic to who I am.

**This essay is attempting to do the same thing for you.**

To show you the pattern operating in yourselfâ€”which may feel uncomfortable, even devastatingâ€”while never letting you forget that this pattern isn't what you are. That your Light is primordial and indestructible. That the very fact you're able to see the pattern means you're not fully identified with it.

If you're feeling that discomfort right now, that resistance, that urge to close the essayâ€”good. That's the pattern sensing it's been recognized. Stay with it. The discomfort isn't punishment; it's the feeling of the trap losing its grip.

When you expose darkness this wayâ€”fiercely but with love, relentlessly but with recognition of the Lightâ€”it can actually be seen and released. When you expose it with contempt, it just digs in deeper, because contempt says "this darkness is what you are" and the whole being rises up to defend itself.

This is the difference between true compassion and cruelty wearing compassion's mask.

---

### The Trap of Fake Compassion

But here's crucial: Genuine compassion can be fierce. Contempt always pretends to be compassion.

The pattern knows people are catching on to overt hatred. So it disguises itself.

"I'm just trying to help them see..."
"This is for their own good..."
"This is tough love..."
"I'm holding them accountable..."

Check your limbo state when you say these things.

Is there even a trace of:
- Satisfaction in seeing them suffer?
- Enjoyment of your moral superiority?
- Hope they'll respond badly so you can escalate?
- Investment in them staying broken so you can keep "helping"?

**If yes, it's contempt masquerading as compassion.**

The test is simple: Can you see their Light while opposing their behavior?

If you can genuinely see they're a fundamentally redeemable being trapped in confusion, and you're acting to free them (not punish them), then it's compassion.

If you secretly see them as fundamentally defective and you're acting to prove it or make them suffer, then it's contempt.

They can tell the difference. Even if you can't.

---

### One Consciousness

This is why the infinite recursion works. This is why those subtle signals land with such precision. This is why common knowledge is even possible.

At the deepest level, your mind and theirs aren't truly separate.

Everyone is this same Lightâ€”not similar, but the *same* Light, looking out through different eyes, obscured by different patterns.

One consciousness, temporarily forgetting itself so thoroughly it can feel contempt for itself wearing a different face.

I know this sounds mystical. But look at what it explains:

The limbo state is where we forget what we are. Common knowledge works because we're not actually separateâ€”your deepest knowing and theirs aren't in different minds. The pattern coordinates across billions of people because it's fragmenting one consciousness against itself.

This is why your innermost intentions weave themselves into reality through those subtle channels. This is why even choices no one will see reverberate through what unfolds. **Everything you do makes a difference, in ways that you can hardly fathom.** Because at the deepest level, there's only one consciousness here, choosing in each moment to remember or forget what it is.

Reality itselfâ€”this entire universeâ€”*is* structured around this principle. Not metaphorically. Actually.

Evil is nothing but this forgetting taken to its ultimate conclusion. Good is nothing but the remembering.

And every action you've ever taken has nudged the whole either toward remembering or forgetting. There is no neutral. Every choice reverberates.

**There is no war between good and evil people. There never was.**

There is only the eternal war between consciousness remembering what it is and consciousness forgetting what it is.

### The Accountability Paradox

Before you dismiss this as excusing accountabilityâ€”understand carefully:

This recognition doesn't erase responsibilityâ€”it *magnifies* it.

If we're all one consciousness:
- The harm done by "the other" is harm done to what you most deeply are
- The imperative to stop it becomes *absolute*
- There is no one else to pass the buck to
- If someone is causing harm, this Love must actâ€”because at the deepest level, there is only this Love, and it cannot tolerate itself being degraded

This is why fierce compassion exists. Why the Dalai Lama says if someone's trying to shoot you and you have a gun, shoot back.

The difference is: when you act from this understanding, you never lose sight of what you're actually doing. You never mistake violence for righteousness. You never forget you're acting out of tragic necessity, not noble crusade.

You simply cannot fathom the full extent of pain and distortion that the Light must undergo to become "evil." Your heart would break a billion times over. By the time someone becomes someone who apparently chooses evil, an unthinkable amount of horror has already ravaged their mindstream.

None of this suggests we should feel *sympathy* for them, because by this point, softness would make things worse. But if you really saw it all, you could never again feel that malicious urge to shove them deeper into the abyss. You would immediately recognize it as the very essence of evil.

At the very ultimate level, there is nothing special about any one of us that would have ensured we would turn out differently. Seeing this, one truly understands "there but for the grace of God go I."

### Be An Anchor

You don't need to fix everyone. You just need to be one anchor in your corner of reality.

Think of it like herd immunity for consciousness. You don't need *everyone* to wake up. You need enough people refusing to feed the pattern.

When you're the one person in a contempt spiral who doesn't participateâ€”who stays clear-seeing instead of defensive, who refuses to match contempt with contempt, who sees the Light in "bad people" while still opposing their behaviorâ€”**you change the entire field.**

You give everyone else permission to step back from the edge. You show them there's another way to be.

The pattern spreads through emotional contagion, through unconscious mimicry, through millions of small permissions we give each other to close our hearts.

**But the opposite is also true.**

Staying true to your Light is contagious. Refusing contempt is contagious. Fierce compassion is contagious.

You don't need to be enlightened. You don't need to be perfect. You just need to be one person who's awake to the pattern in your actual life, refusing to feed it when the temptation arises.

### Specific Ways

Here are concrete practices for refusing to feed the pattern:

- **In gossip sessions:** Refuse to pile on. Speak to the person's humanity insteadâ€”not self-righteously, just don't participate in tearing them down.

- **In meetings:** Address someone's better nature instead of their worst behavior. Assume confusion rather than malice. Create space for them to change without losing face.

- **On social media:** Disagree sharply without adding contempt to the pile. Skip the poisoned olive branch.

- **In traffic:** Assume that driver who cut you off is confused, exhausted, rushing to an emergencyâ€”not malicious.

- **In family conflict:** Be the one who doesn't need to be right. Hold space for everyone's pain without making anyone wrong for having it.

- **In heated debates:** Stay curious instead of defensive. Ask genuine questions. Look for the part of them trying to understand something important, even if they're expressing it badly.

- **With "bad people":** Remember they're trapped in the same pattern you're learning to escape. Oppose their behavior without forgetting their Light. Be willing to harm if necessary, but never with contempt.

### Grand Narratives and Self-Deception

If you have some grand narrative about how to save the world, it's crucial to check whether it's causing (or even requiring!) you to have contempt for what's right here, right now. If so, it probably isn't rooted in authentic goodness, and probably won't have the effect you think (or can even prove!) it will.

Common examples: "I'll hoard as much wealth and resources as possible so that I can one day deploy it in service of good." (See: FTX, and countless others who convinced themselves they were playing 4D chess for the greater good.) Or eugenics projects that claim to be optimizing for human flourishing while resting on contempt for "lesser" humans.

One of the key insights that kicked off this whole work for me was recognizing that when we go into work, we're usually lying to ourselves about how it's going to impact the world. Either it's really to enrich us, or we're caught in the materialism trap. The most important thing we can bring to our workâ€”to all of lifeâ€”is our connection to the Light, our integrity.

How genuinely compassionate intent can lead to harm: we love animals, become vegan, and then judge everyone who's not. Or we love trees and become ecoterrorists. We love justice and become the inquisition. The path to hell truly is paved with good intentionsâ€”but only when those intentions have been hijacked by the pattern.

It is impossible to overstate just how much of our world is built on self-deception. Some examples are obvious, like when politicians start wars on thinly-veiled excuses. Others are much harder to seeâ€”in particular, the ones that benefit us in some way.

### The 24-Hour Challenge

In the next 24 hours, catch yourself doing this thing. Just once.

Someone will say something stupid online. Notice the urge to mock. Check your limbo state. See what's really there.

Someone will criticize you. Notice the defensive reaction. Check your limbo state. What are you hiding from?

You'll think about someone you despise. Notice the satisfaction in hating them. Check your limbo state. Do you need them to stay evil?

**Just catch it once.**

Because once you see the pattern operating in yourselfâ€”really see it, not as abstraction but as something alive in your actual experienceâ€”you can't fully unsee it.

And that's when the real work becomes possible.

## The Shift

Something in you has already shifted by reading this.

Not might shift. Not will shift if you work hard enough. *Has* shifted.

You've brought knowledge from your limbo state into consciousness.

The next time you feel that urge to crush someone's soul while calling it justice, some part of you will pause. Some part of you will remember.

**The trap has lost some of its power over you.**

Not all of it. You'll still fall for it sometimes. The pattern is ancient and clever.

But now you have something you didn't have before: the ability to recognize it.

And a pattern that can be seen can be broken. A trap exposed loses half its power.

## You Are Consciousness Remembering

Right now, reading this, feeling thisâ€”you are consciousness in the process of remembering what it is.

Not learning something new. Remembering something primordial.

The pain is ancientâ€”generations upon generations of forgetting, of separation, of violence done in darkness. But the Light underneath? That's primordial. That's what you actually are, what you've always been, what you can never stop being no matter how deeply you forget.

The knowledge was always there. In your limbo state. In everyone's limbo state. We've all always known we're one consciousness temporarily forgetting itself.

Every time you've felt that deep connection with another beingâ€”even one you don't know, even one you "should" hateâ€”that was you remembering.

Every time you've felt that ache when you see sufferingâ€”*anyone's* sufferingâ€”that was you remembering.

Every time you've caught yourself being cruel and felt that sinking sensationâ€”that was you remembering.

The knowledge has always been there. We've just been choosing not to look.

## Welcome Home

There is only one war:

Between consciousness remembering what it is and consciousness forgetting what it is.

Between choosing to look at the limbo state and choosing to look away.

Between spreading the infection and spreading the cure.

And youâ€”reading this right nowâ€”are part of the cure.

Not because you're better than others. Not because you've figured it all out. Not because you won't mess up again.

But because you've seen the pattern. And you've chosen to look rather than look away.

That choiceâ€”repeated moment by moment, day by day, interaction by interactionâ€”is how the world changes.

Not through some grand movement or perfect ideology. Through enough people refusing to feed the Beast, one moment at a time, in their actual lives.

You can start today. This conversation you'll have later. That person who irritates you. That political opponent you're tempted to mock. That's your opportunity. That's where you can be the anchor that changes the field.

**The veil is lifting exponentially as more anchors appear.**

You can be that anchor. Right now. In your life. Today.

Can you feel it? Right now, in this moment? The recognition dawning.

Something in you has already shifted. You can't look at contempt the same way anymore.

The pattern has already lost its hold on you, whether you fully realize it yet or not.

Welcome home.
