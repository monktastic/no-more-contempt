# The Perfect Crime

What if everything we're doing to "fight evil" is secretly making it stronger?

Not accidentally, but on purpose—in a surprising sense.

When we perceive _others_ as fundamentally defective and feel that righteous urge to see them suffer, we think we're fighting evil. But we're feeding it. Our contempt is made of the same _stuff_ that enables their misbehavior in the first place—which means using it necessarily strengthens what we're trying to fight.

In fact, even our modern worldview—pure rationality as the only reliable guide, seeing reality as dead matter to be manipulated—may itself be a manifestation of this darkness.

The conspiracy theorists are sensing something real: a coordinated malevolent intelligence operating beneath conscious awareness. But it's not "them." It's operating through all of us. Through our contempt. Through our certainty that we're different from the "bad people."

Every time we mock an enemy, shame a fool, or enjoy watching "bad people" fail, we're strengthening exactly what we think we're fighting. And a part of us knows this—which is why the mechanism is so devastating.

This isn't metaphor. This is how reality is actually structured. And we're running out of time.
