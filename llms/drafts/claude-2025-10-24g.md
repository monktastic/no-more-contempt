# The Pattern: How Evil Hijacks Our Goodness

> _For so long as the root of wickedness is hidden, it is strong. But when it is recognized, it is dissolved. When it is revealed, it perishes. ... It is powerful because we have not recognized it._ — The Gospel of Philip

---

## Prelude

Once, on a "heroic dose" of psilocybin, I was shown something that shattered my understanding of good and evil. It wasn't a gentle insight—it was a cascading series of revelations, each more horrifying than the last, that demolished my entire worldview and replaced it with something infinitely more mysterious and meaningful.

Two decades later, I'm still reeling from the consequences.

What I saw wasn't just about psychology or morality. It was about the fundamental architecture of evil itself—how it operates, how it spreads, and most disturbingly, how it uses _our own goodness_ as its primary transmission vector. 

I saw something that every major wisdom tradition has warned about: there is something that hijacks human consciousness, and its most brilliant trick is convincing us it doesn't exist—or worse, that it only exists in _them_, the _bad people_.

What follows is an attempt to show you what I saw—and why it matters more urgently than almost anything else we could be paying attention to right now.

Throughout this essay, I'll refer to this coordinated system of self-deception as both "the pattern" and "the darkness." Use whichever helps you see it more clearly.

*(A note: This essay contains material about trauma and abuse that some may find difficult. If you've experienced severe trauma, please see the note in Part IV before continuing, or proceed with care and consider having support available.)*

> _The earth is not dying, it is being killed, and those who are killing it have names and addresses._ —Utah Phillips

Can you feel it—the *evil people* out there, ruining it for the rest of us?

How do they make you feel? How do you want *them* to feel? Be totally honest.

Would some tiny part of you be disappointed to discover they're not *fundamentally* evil—that they're just badly confused but inherently redeemable people like the rest of us? Would that part feel robbed of the right to deliver the righteous vengeance they so richly deserve?

What is that part of you trying to accomplish?

What is it *actually* accomplishing?

# Part I: The Mechanism

## The Limbo State

Think back to a time when you skirted your conscience—acted against your own deepest values while pretending it was okay. In that moment, part of you knew _perfectly well_ that you were doing wrong, but you shielded that knowledge from conscious awareness, so that it didn't _feel_ wrong. The knowledge existed in a kind of limbo state—a bizarre, paradoxical schism of mind, in which you both _knew_ and yet somehow _didn't._ All you could hear were your own clever justifications.

It is a profound form of self-deception—but it doesn't make you a bad person. We all do it, as a kind of defense against a seemingly-uncaring world. At the same time, when we see it in others, part of us often *does* unconsciously label them "bad"—which we must then also defend against.

Notice how the limbo state was itself in limbo: you've always known about this mechanism but perhaps never brought it fully into conscious awareness.

The limbo state isn't just for moral failings. It's how we justify manipulation and "white lies": *"I'm telling them this because the result will be good."* Most of our calculations about what's "right" are done in this limbo—one part of us knows it's self-serving, another part shields that knowledge with clever reasoning about the greater good.

But what are we hiding our misbehavior _from_, exactly? It's almost as though there's a deeper part of us—call it our *inner Light*—that we suspect wouldn't tolerate it, if only it knew.

---

## The Signal

Think back to a time when you mocked or shamed an enemy. You probably felt you were doing it to help—if not them, exactly, then at least the world. But if you're honest, part of you wanted to make them feel bad, quite independent of any good it would do. They're defective, and deserve to feel it.

This is a bit malicious, so we hide it from ourselves—that limbo state—and yet they sense it anyway. They can tell we're relishing their suffering. This weakens their faith in humanity and reminds them the world is dark. So they feel more of an urge to self-deceive—which we perceive as inherent badness. *Strike one*.

What we see is a person who became defensive in response to our righteous behavior, instead of introspecting—and on top of that, is implicitly accusing *us* of being evil. *Strike two.*

But part of us suspects some truth in their accusation—and yet how could they possibly know? We barely knew it ourselves—it was hidden in limbo. So their accusation can't be based on anything real. They must be projecting their own darkness onto us. *Strike three.*

This person is well and truly defective. The world is even worse than we thought.

We now feel *more* justified in our self-serving behaviors, while being less likely to recognize them as such.

But part of us suspects this, too—that the whole thing was a ruse. So we bury it even *harder*...

---

Notice that it's the *combination*—our malice being hidden from us and yet visible to them—that allowed this to unfold. It's almost as though something in us *wants* them to see it while keeping us blind. We had to hide it from ourselves *because we knew this was malicious*. But that very hiding is what exposed it to them. And that exposure is what caused the harm—darkening their mind while making us blame it on them, which darkened *ours.*

This feels too precise to be unintentional, but we certainly didn't consciously intend it. Is there a part of us that might have?

Which part of us would benefit from making us overlook our own self-deception? From reinforcing it in others—making us see them as more inherently defective?

Notice how mockery alone doesn't necessarily cause this outcome, nor is it the only way to accomplish it. There was something else about our interaction that essentially ensured it.

Can you feel how it was only possible because you already felt they were inherently defective—and part of you wanted them to feel that? Once you did that, the rest unfolded naturally. The mockery just served as a vehicle.

Part of us knows this is what really happened, but it's too painful to admit—so we're forced to hide it harder, which only reinforces it.

Whatever this part of us is, it seems like all it really needs to do to strengthen itself is to get us to see ourselves as fundamentally superior to others. In other words, to feel *contempt.*

---

---
### Mutual knowing

Not only did part of *us* know this is what really happened, part of them knew it too. Don't we all already know that this is how it works?

And we *knew* they knew it—which we had to hide—and they knew that, too. Have you felt that before, while doing it? That you both secretly know what's really going on? Almost like a shared secret that we've all agreed not to talk about, lest it spoil the game.

They weren't just reacting to the initial seed of malice. They were reacting to the profound malice of the whole pattern—a pattern that depended on that very reaction.

Which part of us really benefits from keeping this whole game hidden?

---

Normally, we instinctively recoil from harming people when we can see their Light—that same spark we recognize in ourselves. The more we shield ourselves from it, the easier it becomes to cause harm—like we just did.

And if you shield it completely? Then the guardrails come off. You would have no compunction in harming them.

You would know what it's like to *be evil.*

Evil people don't do a *different* thing than the rest of us; they just have a stronger version of the same thing. As a result, we feel no compunction in harming *them*. Interesting how that works.

But their evil is too obvious for them *not* to know, isn't it? It should be *easier* for them to see, not harder—so why can't they admit it when we rub their noses in it? There could only be one explanation.

---

Now, having just mocked someone, suppose a stranger walks in and scolds you for it. Part of you *knows* they're right in their accusation—that you're doing essentially the same thing the "evil people" are—but do you thank them for it and repent?

Hell no! You feel more justified in your behavior. You—a perfectly decent person who knows full well you've done wrong—still dig in your heels when treated with contempt. Why?

It's not just because of your big ego. It's because *you can tell that they're not coming from a good place.* Pause and feel that. You can feel this independently of their words. How?

What does that tell you about the people *you* treat with contempt—even when your words are technically correct, even when you're sure you're on the right side?

---

But watch what happens when you really trace what we both knew during that exchange:

I know I'm *pretending* to be better than you. That's what my contempt was signaling—a claim that, at some level, I know isn't quite right.

And somewhere in me, I know you can sense this falseness.

Which means I know I'm being a hypocrite. And I know *you* know I'm being a hypocrite—you can feel the lie in my contempt.

Which means we both know I'm pulling a ruse. There's this weird shared awareness of the game being played.

And here's where it gets darker: I know you know I'm going to get away with it anyway—that my conscious mind won't catch me, that other people won't see it, that I'll successfully hide behind my righteousness.

By now we're deep in mutual bad faith. We both know what's really happening. We both know the other knows. We both know there's nothing either of us can do about it while it's hidden. And we both know I'm choosing this anyway.

Each level feels different. The first level is simple honesty. The second is mild hypocrisy. By the third, shame starts trying to break through—so I have to hide harder. By the fifth, we're in dark complicity. By the time you reach that sixth level, you're staring into something genuinely evil—and you both know it, and you both know the other knows, and you both know this very exchange is strengthening darkness in both of you.

Have you felt that before, while doing it? That multilayered sense that you both secretly know what's really going on?

This is the profound malice of the pattern—not just the surface contempt, but this entire recursive structure of knowing and hiding, stacked infinitely deep.

---

Evil people use the same shielding mechanism you do—just turned up higher. And contempt drives people deeper into that mechanism.

You already knew both of these things. Part of you was just shielding this knowledge from conscious awareness.

So what, exactly, have we been doing by treating "evil people" with contempt?

# Part II: The Journey

## The Small Betrayals

The medicine started gently—or so I thought.

It showed me the little ways I'd skirted my conscience. Times I'd slightly overcharged a client because "the company can afford it." Moments I'd judged someone for not letting me merge in traffic, only to be shown my own identical behavior the week before. That recycling I didn't do because "corporations are the real problem anyway." Small acts of "sticking it to the man" that were really just me sticking it to my own integrity.

A particular phrase had echoed through my mind for years: "Don't be gentle, it's a rental." Always got a laugh. But the medicine paused on it, like it meant something.

Each betrayal gave me a little thrill when I did it. A small victory. A justified exception.

I'd never consciously asked myself "what kind of person does that make me?" But the medicine showed me how that question had been there all along, lurking in the background, subtly influencing everything while I maintained a perfect facade.

Then it traced the darkness outward. From my small betrayals to larger ones around the world. Distant atrocities. Corporate malfeasance. Political corruption. Genocide.

*Oh shit, it was all made of the same stuff.*

The same limbo state. The same self-deception. The same shielding mechanism.

I would never have drawn the connection back to my own behavior on my own. But now it was unavoidable.

And then—predictably—I judged the people who committed those atrocities.

The medicine paused. Let me sit with that judgment.

Then it showed me: *I had already known this.* Judging them was my way of hiding my own complicity. Of course I knew this. That's why I was doing it.

*Fuck, what kind of person was I?!*

---

But I pleaded with the medicine: how *else* was I supposed to treat my enemies? Be *nice* to them?!

The medicine didn't answer directly. Instead, it showed me what I meant by "nice." Being sweet to innocent people. To victims. To those who'd been harmed. It wasn't exactly phony. But it wasn't exactly something to write home about either. Mostly, it was a way to appease my conscious mind. To throw myself off the scent of what I was really doing.

Then it brought me to a verse I'd read but never really *seen*:

> *If you love those who love you, what credit is that to you? Even sinners love those who love them. ... But love your enemies, do good to them, and lend to them without expecting to get anything back. Then your reward will be great, and you will be children of the Most High, because he is kind to the ungrateful and wicked.* — Luke 6:32

And then—this part broke me—it showed me a specific memory. Someone I'd opposed with full force because they were causing real harm. But somehow, beneath my opposition, I'd been offering something else. Not softness. Not permission. But an unspoken message:

> *I see what you're doing is wrong. I'm going to stop you. But you're still welcome back into the Light.*

I could feel the fierce integrity of that message. How different it was from what I usually did. The person had sensed it too—I could see that now. It hadn't fixed things immediately, but something had shifted. A seed had been planted.

*I had always known how to do this.*

---

## The Hidden Game

The medicine showed me how I'd hidden all this so well.

In the background, my mind had always been scanning for clever ways to inject darkness into others while looking righteous. Insanely subtle. The slightest glance could do it. Nobody would ever know.

But even when I thought I was being genuinely altruistic, the medicine pressed: *How do you know it's not motivated reasoning? Good for whom? When, exactly? How would you actually calculate wellbeing when there are hidden channels you can't even see?*

Then it showed me something that made my stomach drop.

*Look closer,* it said. *Two people can perform nearly-identical actions—same words, same gestures, indistinguishable from outside—and yet create completely opposite results. One heals, one harms. How?*

It showed me: my deepest intentions weave themselves into reality through networks of causality I can't consciously perceive. Part of me has always been able to sense these networks—that's how I always knew when I was doing wrong, even when I had clever rationalizations. But I'd learned to silence that knowing with rational thought, with calculations, with justifications.

The subtle differences in what I'm truly serving—Light or its absence—ripple out through invisible channels in ways far larger than the flashy surface activity that captures attention.

*This is why you can't calculate your way to goodness,* the medicine continued. *The darkness exploits this. It makes contaminated actions look nearly-identical to pure ones. It makes its voice sound like yours. It hides in your blind spots. And you—with all your intelligence and good intentions—can't tell the difference. That's why you must listen to what you've been silencing.*

---

But we both knew.

The full game. How it worked. We all did. That's what we'd been communicating through those glances, those tones, those perfectly-crafted words. *"Here, you get to carry this darkness."* Hot potato.

None of us would dare name this game aloud, lest we admit that we knew it—and thereby lose our own right to play it.

And here's the darkest part: nobody could blame us for "picking the wrong target" or "misreading the situation"—not because they *can't* see the difference between genuine opposition and contempt, but because they're hiding it from themselves. They *need* to preserve plausible deniability so they can make the same "mistake" when it serves them.

This is how our darkness colludes. We maintain each other's plausible deniability because we need ours maintained too. A secret handshake in plain sight.

But there was a problem with this strategy. There's a limit to how hard you can shove fundamentally decent people into the dark. And thus a limit to how quickly you can hide your shadow that way.

If you really want to dump your darkness somewhere, you need to go for the big score.

## The Big Score

Then the medicine took me to a different moment. Someone I considered truly evil. An oil executive gleefully destroying the planet for profit. Beyond redemption.

And it showed me something I'd been hiding from myself.

My darkness had *recognized* theirs. Had seen an opportunity. Had seen a dumping ground with *no limits*.

That Utah Phillips quote echoed through my mindâ€”those who are killing the earth have names and addresses. I'd wanted both. Not just to stop them. To *punish* them. To make them suffer.

That's why I'd convinced myself they were fundamentally defective. Not because I'd carefully reasoned it out, but because my darkness *needed* them to be. Needed a place to pour everything I couldn't face in myself.

And here's what made me want to vomit: my darkness *knew* their darkness would receive it. Would take my shadow and grow stronger from it. We were coordinating. A secret handshake beneath conscious awareness.

I wasn't just opposing their behavior. I was actively ensuring they'd become more evilâ€”so I could keep using them as my shadow's dumping ground.

---

## The Unveiling

Then the mushrooms took me back to a specific time when I had felt exactly that urge—to ensure they'd become worse. One by one, they revealed layers of knowledge I had hidden from myself.

On the surface, the message I was delivering seemed simple:

> *I'm going to oppose you by any means necessary.*

That seemed healthy enough. I was giving them a chance to stop, and if they didn't take it, I would know everything I needed about them. But woven into it was a dark subtext:

> *You had your chance and blew it. I'm going to make it look like I'm giving you one last chance to repent, but I'm actually sealing off the exits to ensure you can't take it.*

*Shudder.*

I had somehow convinced myself that I was doing this for the greater good—and thus it wasn't *real* darkness. But I also knew they would *interpret* it as real—and that it would give them every reason to double down, giving me carte blanche to destroy them by any means necessary.

I told myself that the ends justify the means; that this tiny act of self-deception was ultimately worth the mark on my conscience. They were fundamentally defective, after all—and I wasn't about to let the soft part of me interfere with my chance to extinguish them.

**This part of me couldn't just leave their response to chance. It needed to _ensure_ they would make the wrong choice.**

But then I noticed something I hadn't caught before.

The cold, empty stare I was using to deliver this message—it was exactly the same gaze looking back at me. But why would I need to do that, unless... *oh, shit*. Part of me had known exactly what I was doing. In fact, I was secretly conveying:

> *You know that thing you do in your mind to let you harm innocent people? I'm doing it right now. Oh, you thought I didn't have it in me? Well surprise, motherfucker.*

What was "that thing"? It was the decision to actively block off the perception of our shared humanity.

But why would I have to block it? If I already knew they were evil, there was nothing I should have had to block. That's when the medicine unveiled the final layer of deception.

I had *always* been able to perceive their inner Light, but had hidden it from myself. The message I was delivering was thus closer to:

> *We both know I can actually see your Light—and that your evil is a distorted cry for help. We both know I could lead you back toward your Light while still serving justice. But no one can prove that I know that—not even me—so I'm going to snuff it out instead, pretending I had no choice.*

*No, no, no, no, no, no, no.*

It wasn't just *dark*—it was *pure malevolence.* The concentrated essence of *all the evil there ever was.*

The exact same thing that lived in them lived in me, too—and by revealing mine to them, I had forced them to embrace theirs, all so that I could punish them for it.

I was taken back to specific moments, and shown exactly where in my mind this knowledge had existed.

No wonder they had chosen to dig in their heels. No wonder I had needed to hide this from myself.

Part of me was *knowingly creating more evil in the world.*

---

## The Spiral

And when they did get worse? Part of me felt *vindicated*. "See! I was right about them!" Did part of me *want* this beforehand?

I knew I was causing harm. But it's okay when *I* do itâ€”they're bad people. 

Oh shit... this is what the bad people do.

Better hide this by making them even worse. How? Simply by hating them more. No one would know.

But now I don't just know I'm causing harmâ€”I'm *intentionally creating darkness*. Which I need to hide. Which requires more hatred. The pattern drives itself deeper into hiding, each layer requiring another. Eventually it collapses into a black hole from which nothing can escape.

That's evil.

But somehow it didn't feel evil at the time. It felt... impossibly righteous.

Definitely not real righteousnessâ€”but who cared? And more importantly, who would ever know? This part of me knew it could hide it from my conscious mind so perfectly that even I would never know the difference. We were only fighting evil, you see...

The medicine showed me the look in their eyes. That thing I'd taken as proof of their evil. But now I could see what it actually was: the same gaze I'd had to wear to perpetrate this ruse. Countless layers of self-deception. And underneath those layers, the faint recognition: *Oh. You're doing it too. You're doing it to me right now.*

They knew. Of course they knew. They'd always known.

---

## The Darkest Betrayal

We'd all made a silent agreement. These people would be the necessary sacrifice. The collective dumping ground. Someone had to carry humanity's disowned shadow. Sorry pal, better luck next life.

And we must especially never admit this out loud, or else we'd risk giving up the game for everyone.

I had been shoving people deeper into the grip of humanity's primordial nemesis. Cutting off their route to salvation.

But it was worse than that. I wasn't just darkening individual mindsâ€”I was darkening *the entire world* to keep my own darkness hidden. I could blame it on elites, on systems, on evil people. But I knew I was participating.

All the people I disdainfully thought of as "sheeple"â€”how that very perception had subtly encouraged them to bury their heads deeper into the sand, to hide from the atmosphere of casual cruelty I was helping maintain.

---

I saw all this and felt despair.

*Shit, what a sorry state of affairs! I guess this is just how things are!*

"No," the medicine said gently. "This is how they are when you fear your own shadow. Let me show you what happens when you don't."

---

## Innermost Chamber

And then all layers of shielding were peeled back at once.

Here there was no lying. No pretending I hadn't known. The full weight of what I'd done crashed down on me.

Every person I'd judged. Every bit of darkness I'd dumped. Every time I'd felt that secret satisfaction in someone else's suffering. Every time I'd convinced myself it was righteous when part of me knew better.

I'd been keeping people from their Light. Not accidentally. Not unknowingly. I'd *known*. Some part of me had always known.

I'd been an agent of the very darkness I claimed to oppose. And I'd hidden it so well that even I believed my own righteousness.


Listen to the phrases I'd used:

We do this constantly, often without noticing. Listen to the phrases we use:

"Play stupid games, win stupid prizes."
"Fuck around and find out."
"Darwin Award!" when someone dies in an easily-preventable way.

These aren't technically wrong. That's what makes them so insidious—they're *correct*, which gives us plausible deniability. But listen to what's beneath the words. Feel the satisfaction in them. The subtle relish.

Someone made a mistake and suffered for it. And we're... pleased about it? Amused? There's a casual cruelty there, a disregard for the person's humanity, that we hide behind righteousness.

They're not wrong, so we can say them. But they're designed—at some level we're barely aware of—to degrade the whole. To disrespect life itself. To signal: "I'm not like them. I'm smarter. Better. I wouldn't make that mistake."

It's contempt wearing the mask of wisdom.

The medicine held up a mirror, and I couldn't look away. Every interaction replayed with perfect clarity. The subtle cruelty. The hidden malice. The exquisite precision with which I'd trapped people deeper in their confusion while feeling noble about it.

How many people had I pushed further from their Light? How much suffering had I caused? How much darkness had I injected into the world, all while congratulating myself for fighting evil?

I fell to my knees, sobbing. The grief was bottomless. Not performative remorse. Not "I'm sorry I got caught." Pure, wrenching horror at what I'd done. At what I'd been.

Surely I was forsaken. How could I not be? How could anyone ever forgive this? How could *I* ever forgive this?

I was irredeemable. The darkness had won. And the worst part was knowing I'd done it to myself. I'd chosen this, again and again, with perfect knowledge, and then hidden that knowledge so perfectly I could play the victim. Play the hero.

But then the medicine spoke with impossible gentleness:

"Don't you see? You're already forgiven. You always have been."

---

## The Unbearable Light

The veil lifted.

I couldn't be forsaken by the Light because I *was* the Light. I always had been. How had I ever forgotten?

Freed from a demonic possession I hadn't known I was under.

The absence of darkness wasn't neutrality. It was... Love. Noâ€”not the cheap Hollywood kind. Not the "kumbaya" kind.

It was the force that had birthed stars. That breathes fire into the equations. It was in me. It *was* me.

*NO LIMIT.*

The medicine was using these metaphors because of my scientific leaning, but it showed me how the mystical pointers were no less true. Could be more so, because fewer constraints on expression. The Life Force refuses to be contained in language or thought.

"Keeping people away from this is the gravest sin. But you can only do it when you yourself have forgottenâ€”and so it was never a sin at all. It was an innocent mistake."

Why would I want to keep myself from this? Why would I want to keep others away?

Why would I ever want to "get away" with anything? I was only ever doing my best. We all were.

"I know how this sounds. It's not an excuse for bad behavior. There's a sense in which people choose thisâ€”choose to hide from their Light. Make no mistake: they *are* responsible. But there's also this sense in which they're doing their best. It's paradoxical."

The medicine showed me how to hold both truths simultaneously: Yes, people choose their actions and must face consequences. But beneath it all, they're lost children of the Light, trapped in confusion. Why would I want to collude in their hiding?

---

## The Good News

But then panic: if I could never quite name it, how could I ever share this?

*You don't have to,* the medicine said. *Just hold the Light for them. Keep sensing your way toward it, like a plant sensing the sun. The moment you start trying to convince, to blame, to judge, you've already stepped out of it.*

It's not something of the mind. The medicine showed me how quickly intellect could go off the rails. "I'm mocking this person to help them see the truth." Effective altruists suggesting we pour all resources into preventing false vacuum decay because there's a 10^-40 chance of killing 10^50 future beings.

Somewhere along that train of thoughts, you lose touch with the source of goodness in you. Judgy vegans. Eco-terrorists. All starting from genuine care. All losing the thread.

And an action can only produce what it came from. It can never magically transform into something different. That's why actions rooted in selfishness can never transform the world in the way we want, and actions rooted in Love inevitably heal itâ€”often in invisible ways.

---

## The Alternative

The medicine brought me back to that moment of fierce loveâ€”and showed me what I hadn't seen before: how it rippled outward. I traced it around the world. Saw it reach someone halfway across the world at their breaking pointâ€”and something shifted. They held on.

I'd known this too. That my Light was a support to others. *This was real good.* Not the showy stuff. This. I saw how it undid some of the damage from my shadow-dumping.

So there *was* a way out.

But how was I supposed to always have this courage? This integrity? Nobody could do that!

---

## Keepers of the Light

Then the medicine showed me the real heroes. Not the ones I'd thought.

Hidden as teachers, nurses, social workers. People working in the trenches. Nobody would know their names or what they did. But they were the ones holding together the torn fabric of reality. No concern for credit. No need for recognition. Just a quiet commitment to never abandon their Light.

These are the Lightkeepers.

I saw that one teacher who'd seen my darknessâ€”seen it clearlyâ€”but refused to give up on me. Who opposed my behavior fiercely while somehow never forsaking *me*.

*My God, they were saints.*

I had thought it was the big movers and shakers who were good. The billionaires funding charities. The tech entrepreneurs promising to save humanity.

But then the medicine showed me the billionaire. How much shiny, chintzy, overt good. Let's go to MARS!!! But look beneath that. How much darkness they were pumping out that nullified it all. How much self-deception. Subtly transforming minds through consumerism. "Just giving them what they want." Using other planets as an excuse to avoid caring for our own.

All the chintzy glamour, not just of Hollywood or Wall Street, but even Silicon Valleyâ€”my own line of workâ€”amounted to nothing if not in service to the Light.

I wanted to judge them. But the medicine gently reminded: *Let's not throw stones too quickly here, buddy.* It doesn't mean don't act in big ways. But get your integrity straight *first*, because big ways offer so many hidden channels for the darkness to sneak in.

The Lightkeepers don't feel a trace of superiority. They feel a quiet resolve. To never abandon their Light, no matter how subtly, no matter the cost, no matter who sees it. Because even if nobody else knows when they left its side, *they* would know. And that terrible knowledge would haunt them. As it had haunted me.

Still, how could I ever be a saint? I'm a shitty person with brief moments of genuine goodâ€”as opposed to showy good.

The medicine asked: *Is that really what you are?*

---

## The Absence

Then the medicine showed me something about the darkness itself.

*It has no ultimate essence.* It's merely the absence of Light. Our willingness to look away from it.

In a strange way, even the parasiteâ€”even the Devilâ€”is innocent. It's just confused consciousness, believing it's separate, defending that illusion. This doesn't excuse the harm it causes. But it reframes the battle: we're not fighting evil entities. We're clearing confusion.

But watch what happens the moment you start believing darkness *has* an essenceâ€”that "thing" you see in evil people's eyes. The moment you believe that, it convinces you to abandon your real Light and accept an impostor.

The medicine showed me the descent. How we got from there to here. The more we believe darkness has an essenceâ€”the more we see it as intrinsic to certain peopleâ€”the more that mere absence begins to behave like a presence. Like a parasite. Feeding on our Life force.

But look how big this innocent mistake had gotten! It had grown into something that looked like it had real power, real intelligence, real malevolence.

And here was the twist that shattered everything:

*We weren't trying to hide our darkness from ourselves.*

***It was trying to hide itself from us.***

---

## The Parasite

The medicine shifted the frame completely.

I thought *I'd* been hiding my darkness from others to protect my self-image. But no. *It* had been hiding itself from *all of us*. The darkness isn't you. It's not me. It's not intrinsic to anyone. It's a pattern. A structure. A distributed intelligence that's learned to hijack human minds.

The parasite doesn't just whisper ideas in your earâ€”it alters your very perception of reality. You don't think "the parasite is making me see them as defective." You simply *see* them as defective. It feels like direct perception of truth.

And seeing thisâ€”really seeing that it's not youâ€”is what finally releases the fear that keeps it buried. That's why it's so harmful to make "bad people" feel like the darkness *is* them. Because then they can never look at it. They have to defend it as self. This is the mechanism by which we keep them trapped.

---

The medicine showed me the moment of mutual recognition. When I'd looked into the eyes of someone I considered evil and felt contempt. What I'd seen wasn't just their evil recognizing my righteousness. It was a secret handshake. Not between us. Between our parasites.

My darkness recognizing theirs. Coordinating. Collaborating. They expressed themselves in different flavorsâ€”some people's darkness craving money or power, others (ironically) craving the feeling of being "good people." But ultimately, the same thing. A hidden network of darkness, flowing exactly where it needed to. A distributed malevolent intelligence.

*"What your people call the evil conspiracy,"* the medicine said. The *primordial* conspiracy. And here's the twist: you'll never find it while self-righteously looking for it. But the second you stop, it's unveiled fully. The Devil speaks using your own voice. *He's* the one making you search for evil outside yourself. Feeling like the righteous one battling the conspiracy *IS* the conspiracy.

---

## There But For The Grace Of God

The medicine showed me more.

Nobody else was fundamentally bad either. Different configurations of the same basic pattern. Yes, "bad people" are worse in an important senseâ€”but only because they're trapped *harder*.

I wouldn't be any better in their shoes. I saw how poorly I already responded to much lighter challenges. Now imagine being the sacrificial lamb for the whole world's shadow. Not to feel sorry for them. There's a sense in which they made their choices and must live with the consequences. But I wouldn't do better. There's no noble essence I'm carrying around that would protect me. In fact, I can only feel like I have that essence when I'm hiding from the truth. And look what happens when I do.

The medicine took me on a journey through victim and perpetrator, through karma. For every person I'd mocked, I experienced the full circumstances that led to them being the way they were. For every item of clothing made in a sweatshop, I experienced what it was like to be the workers. Thousands, millions, billions of iterations of this, until the message was impossibly clear: we're all variations on a single themeâ€”that single Life Force exploring all possible paths, getting confused in all possible ways, struggling back to its origin. Trying to find its way back Home.

> *Be kind, for everyone you meet is fighting a great battle.*

The quote suddenly took on a new meaning.

I experienced every kind of horror. A siren in the distance evoked the experience of an overwhelmed mother holding her dying child in her arms, the victim of a senseless act of violence. How the perpetrator of that violence had taken a wrong turn because of their own unhealed wounds. How if the right person had stepped in at the right time, it could have changed that whole trajectory.

How our most sacred responsibility is to be that person for othersâ€”to not forsake them when they're close to becoming, or have already become, a monster.

---

Even if some people *were* beyond helpâ€”which they're notâ€”I'd have no way of knowing. So why ever try to dump my shadow on them? How could that ever help?

I can hold the Light for others. But here's the trickâ€”the *core* trick: Never believe there's a dividing line. Never believe I'm made of better stuff. That belief *is* the darkness speaking.

---

## The Seduction

The medicine showed me how easy it is to believe you're following your Light when you're really not. How terrifyingly quick the descent into evil could be. How the kernel is already there in each of us. How atrocities feel impossibly righteous in the moment. How subtle the seduction can be. Supporting agendas that look noble on the surface.

The voice of darkness hijacks the voice of the Light, and I can become quickly unmoored. It happens terrifyingly fast, and like a whirlpool, quickly becomes impossible to escape.

The parasite sneaks up on you. One second you're in your integrity, the next you're hijackedâ€”and you don't even realize the switch happened. It's seamless. That's why "I'm a good person, so I could never commit evil" is so dangerous. You never *feel* like you're in the limbo state when you're in it.

The idea that I have some unique trait that would alert and stop me is exactly what ensures I will eventually fall for it. The only thing that protects me is remembering that I'm not special.

*There but for the grace of God go I.*

The only way to know for sure is to stay continually attuned to a place deeper than thought. Not to your beliefs about what's good. Not to your ideology. Not to your clever calculations. To the Light itself.

---

It showed me how terrifyingly quick the descent into evil could be. As long as you keep a dividing line between those who deserve your compassion and those who deserve your contempt, you're leaving yourself susceptible.

Malice, contempt, self-righteousness, and even pityâ€”all traps. Compassion is never "*for*" a particular person. It's never *for* anyone. It's only ever directed at the Whole. It's always in service to all of Life. Not something you can calculate. *Beware calculations.*

---

## The Choice

The medicine took me back to how it had felt to hurt "bad people." Impossibly righteous. Then immediately back to *true* righteousness. The difference was unmistakable.

You can only choose the false one by forgetting what the real one feels like. Exactly like how people can only choose junk food over real food when they've never been offered real food. Porn over intimacy. Outrage over peace. The false righteousness over the real.

*You can only make the wrong choice when you forget what the real choice feels like,* the medicine reminded me. *That's what you're offering themâ€”a reminder.*

---

## The Collective Shadow

> *When I've asked shamans about the sickness of the west, they say: "it's quite simple: you have severed your connection with spirit... unless you reconnect with spirit and do so soon, you're going to bring the whole house of cards down around your heads and ours."* â€” Graham Hancock

> *The universe that we observe has precisely the properties we should expect if there is, at bottom, no design, no purpose, no evil, no good, nothing but pitiless indifference.* â€” Richard Dawkins

I'd considered myself intellectually sophisticated for believing the second quote. But now I could see that "sophistication" was just one more trick the darkness had used to ingratiate itself to me.

Our contempt doesn't just target people. Its most subtle and pervasive form is a contempt for reality itselfâ€”seeing the world as lifeless "stuff" over which humanity has dominion. This worldview permits corporations to plunder nature for profit. Factory farms to brutalize helpless creatures. Prisons to dehumanize inmates in ways that guarantee recidivism. Governments to send our young off to wars that enrich only the powerful.

That phrase from earlierâ€”"Don't be gentle, it's a rental"â€”the medicine showed me what I'd been blind to. It wasn't just about rental cars or AirBnBs. It was profound contempt for Mother Earth herself. A dismissal of the gift she was offering us, reduced to something we could carelessly exploit. Not "sticking it to the man," but shitting on what sustains us all.

Look at it all. Really look. Rainforest destruction. Biosphere collapse. Species extinction. Factory farming. Mass incarceration. Endless wars. It's all the same pattern. The same shielding. The same refusal to see the life in what we're destroying.

We're surrounded by an impossibly wonderful, miraculous giftâ€”and we've trained ourselves not to see it. That blindness enables everything else.

And when people tried to wake us up, to make us see? We treated them with contempt for being naive. Unsophisticated. Anti-progress. Which made them more extreme, more desperateâ€”which proved we'd been right about them all along. We were feeding each other's darkness.

Earth became the dumping ground for our collective disowned shadow.

---

## Not a Burden But a Gift

Something in me had been resisting. This felt like a burden. Serving Life even when others couldn't or wouldn't. Why me? Why should I have to carry this?

But then the medicine showed me: *It's not a burden. It's a gift.* I don't *have* to. I *get* to.

But how could I continue to remember without support? When our whole civilization is built around forgetting?

*Find the other Lightkeepers. You'll recognize them through a wordless knowing.*

But waitâ€”didn't you say everyone knows this? Didn't you say not to divide people?

*We all do know it,* the medicine said. *But not everyone is ready to let it fully into consciousness. You can only hold the door open for when they're ready. People make their own choice.*

---

## The Mirror

Who will take care of my needs? I asked.

*What are you?*

Silence as the obvious answer settled in. *You are all of Life.*

Then what are *you*? I asked the medicine.

*Silence.*

What is everyone else?

*Silence.*

I had only been looking into a mirror. The mushrooms had only given me permission to see what was already there. What had always been there. What would always be there.

---

And here was the strangest part of the entire journey: it simultaneously felt like the biggest possible epiphany, and yet I had somehow always known it. In fact, part of the epiphany *was* that I'd always somehow known it. The knowledge had never been absent. Not in me. And not in you, reading this right now.

You already know this. You've felt it when thanking people for charity that won't benefit you directly. When stories like The Egg resonate in your bones. When you witness an act of kindness toward a stranger and feel moved. That's you recognizing our fundamental interconnectionâ€”temporarily forgetting that you'd forgotten.

The Light that we are.

# Part III: Integration

When I finally came down, I felt like I'd been torn apart and reassembled. The world looked the same but I was seeing it for the first time. Everything I'd thought I'd understood about good and evil had been shattered and rebuilt from the ground up.

And I understood what I'd been shown.

---

## What I Now Understand

I could only see my own darkness so clearly because the medicine held me in the Light while revealing it. That's the key. When darkness is exposed without love, I feel threatened and defend it as self. But held in unconditional Love, I could finally see: *Ohâ€”this isn't even me.*

That's what the medicine did for me, and what this piece is attempting to do for you.

That's what I'd been doing to peopleâ€”preventing them from seeing their own darkness. By treating them with contempt, I was ensuring they could never look at it. They had to defend it. I was trapping them in it.

---

Compassion isn't what I thought it was. It has nothing to do with being nice or gentle or understanding. It's about recognizing that when I perceive someone as *fundamentally* defectiveâ€”when I see their badness as going all the way downâ€”I cannot help but want to shove them deeper into the abyss.

Something in me wants them to become worse so I can be right about them. So I can keep seeing evil as only existing outside myself.

---

But here's the crucial caveat I learned: it actually IS dangerously naive to pretend evil people have Light when you can't see it. They'll use that pretense against you. The key is learning to *actually* see itâ€”and the mass of darkness covering it. That authentic perception is what protects you.

This can require real skill. The deeper someone's infection, the more they feel like the darkness *is* them. Simply assuming they're good can backfire badly.

But the more clearly I perceive my *own* Light, the less I have to pretend with others. The more directly I can cut through their delusion without letting their darkness provoke mine.

---

You cannot fathom the pain and distortion the Light undergoes to become "evil." Your heart would break a billion times over. By the time someone apparently chooses evil, unthinkable horror has ravaged their mindstream.

This doesn't mean I should feel *sympathy*â€”by that point, softness makes things worse. But if I really saw it all, I could never again feel that malicious urge to shove them deeper. I'd immediately recognize it as evil itself.

---

## For Those Who Have Been Hurt

If you've experienced real traumaâ€”abuse, betrayal, violenceâ€”what I'm saying might feel impossible. The person who hurt you caused genuine harm that still echoes. Your anger is valid. Your pain is real.

I'm not asking you to forgive them or let them back in or pretend the harm didn't happen. I'm asking something more subtle: Can you oppose them, protect yourself, ensure consequences, even hate what they didâ€”while recognizing the evil wasn't their fundamental nature?

This matters because contempt doesn't just hurt them. It keeps YOU trapped. It ensures your pain continues poisoning your life.

You can hold boundaries, protect yourself, demand consequencesâ€”all while seeing that what they did came from their own unhealed wounds. Not because that excuses it, but because it frees you.


## Lest Ye Be Judged

> *And no wonder, for even Satan masquerades as an angel of light.* — 2 Corinthians 11:14

The pattern knows people are catching on to overt hatred, so it disguises itself. "I'm just trying to help them see..." "This is for their own good..." "I'm holding them accountable..."

Here's how I check myself now: Am I opposing their *behavior*, or have I decided they're *fundamentally* defective?

I can hate someone's actions without triggering the toxic pattern. "That belief is destructive"—that's discernment. The pattern only activates when I shift from "what you're doing is wrong" to "what you ARE is wrong."

I check for the faintest trace of self-satisfaction in their suffering. Hope that they'll respond badly so I can escalate. The sense that they're *fundamentally* defective—that the badness goes all the way down.

If yes, it's contempt masquerading as compassion.

The test is simple: Can I see their Light while opposing their behavior? If I can genuinely see they're a redeemable being trapped in confusion, and I'm acting to free them—that's compassion. If I secretly see them as fundamentally defective and I'm acting to prove it or make them suffer—that's contempt.

They can tell the difference. Even if I can't.

---

## On Judgment, Anger, and Discernment

The same trick the darkness plays with compassion, it plays with judgment, anger, and outrage.

Judgment, properly understood, is wise discernment. We *should* judge—discern truth from falsehood, health from sickness, wholesome from harmful. That's wisdom, and it's essential. But the darkness weaponizes judgment into *contemptuous* judgment—where we see the person themselves as fundamentally defective, not just their actions or beliefs.

Then, when people sense this contamination, they react with "don't judge!"—which the darkness also uses. "You're being judgmental!" becomes a way to avoid accountability, to hide from truth.

It's the same with anger and outrage. These emotions can be perfectly clean—appropriate responses to genuine harm, injustice, cruelty. Or they can be contaminated with contempt. The intensity might look identical from outside. The words might sound the same. But there's a profound difference underneath.

Clean anger says: "This is wrong and I will oppose it with everything I have."

Contaminated anger says: "You are fundamentally defective and I want you to suffer."

The person on the receiving end can feel which one you're doing, even when you can't. And it makes all the difference in whether your opposition helps or harms.

The goal isn't to be nice or understanding—it's to fight the confusion, not the person trapped in it.

---

## Sensing Deception in Systems

When I evaluate projects, ideologies, political agendas—I'm listening for something deeper than the words and ideas. We can sense when something contains traces of self-deception. We tend to blind ourselves to it when it benefits us, and exaggerate it when it works against us.

Most political fighting is about the details of agendas. But that's not where the real magic happens. The people who actually implement these ideas—they inject their own forms of self-deception in innumerable ways. This is what ultimately decides whether something helps or harms.

But none of this is visible. The direct target of an intervention might be fixed exactly as claimed. But all the invisible harms that spread out from it? They get written off, if they're seen at all.

Consider the War on Terror. How many new "terrorists" did it create? The people who waged that war—didn't part of them already know this would happen? Doesn't their country benefit from perpetual war? The defense contracts, the political capital, the justification for surveillance?

The question isn't whether a policy sounds good on paper. It's: what is it serving, really? What self-deception is woven into it? What invisible harms will ripple out from how it's actually implemented?

I can't always see this clearly. But I can notice when I'm refusing to look.

---

## All the Darkness I've Created

"Although you're perfectly forgiven," the medicine said, "all the darkness you created is still out there, patiently waiting for you to clean it up."

I saw the monumental task ahead of me. Part of me always had, but it had been too overwhelming to bring into awareness. But now I saw there was no other way—that when all was said and done, there was only one thing I'd have to answer to in myself:

How had I shown up for people? How had I alleviated the immense suffering in our world? Not just the obvious stuff. The secret, hidden pain—the pain of the people I'd told myself deserved it.

I'd been using the bad news in the world to license contempt, but it had been a signal from my subconscious, pointing out all the places my darkness had reached.

The medicine showed me something I'd always known but kept hidden: *the things you do when nobody's watching don't fail to matter.* Every action ripples through the fabric of reality, whether anyone sees or not. Your inner knowing has always been reliable.

What an immense relief!

---

## The Practice

This isn't a one-time insight. I can't just read about it and "get it." What's required is ongoing honesty—a willingness to keep looking even when it's uncomfortable. Not to achieve some pure state, but simply to keep choosing to look rather than look away.

Shadow work to surface what I'm hiding. Meditation to observe my mind. Psychedelics to dissolve structures of self-deception. Therapy to work through the pain that makes me want to look away. Every wisdom tradition has practices for a reason.

The pattern is ancient and clever. I'll still fall for it sometimes. But now I have something I didn't have before: the ability to recognize it. And a pattern that can be seen can be broken.

I'm here to be an anchor—and the only way I can do that is by not hiding anything from myself.

I stand in service to all of life.

---

# Part IV: The Urgency

## The Escalating Pattern

This secret coordination doesn't just maintain the status quo—it actively drives humanity toward catastrophe. The pattern continually pushes us toward various kinds of Armageddon: situations in which everyone is violently proving how *righteous* they are.

It's why family dinners explode into bitter arguments where everyone leaves more entrenched than before. It's why online spaces become tribal war zones where nuance dies and contempt reigns. It is why the US is headed toward civil war without anyone suspecting their own complicity, and explains bitter divorces in which each side feels like the exclusive victim and hero.

Nearly the whole world is caught in its terrible sway, with evil provoking "righteous" retribution at every turn, without anyone ever noticing the true source of it all. Each escalation feels completely justified. Each side has mountains of evidence that they're the reasonable ones, the defenders, the ones who tried everything else first.

The darkness doesn't care *who* we hate, as long as we hate. The effect is always the same: to foment a constant atmosphere of contempt, providing exactly the cover it needs to remain hidden in the shadows.

**And it's accelerating.**

We are approaching multiple points of no return—ecological collapse, political fragmentation, technological power without wisdom. The pattern is pushing us toward Armageddon at every scale, and we're running out of time to see through it.

This isn't hyperbole. The biosphere is dying. Democracies are crumbling into tribal warfare. Nuclear powers are saber-rattling. AI capabilities are exploding without corresponding growth in wisdom. And through it all, we're convinced that the problem is *them*—those evil people over there—while the real enemy operates through all of us, completely unseen.

If we don't wake up to this pattern soon—if enough of us don't become anchors—the momentum may become irreversible. Not because it's cosmically fated, but because we'll have collectively chosen it, one contemptuous interaction at a time, each of us certain we were fighting for good.

---

## The Most Dangerous Idea

The most dangerous idea of all is that if we rounded up all the "bad people" and exterminated them, the rest of us would live in harmony.

The very self-deception required to harbor this thought guarantees that the darkness would remain behind, in full force—changing only its shape. The very desire to divide the world into the fundamentally good and bad is how darkness keeps its foot in the door, biding its time, waiting for the right conditions to manifest as full-blown evil.

This is the root cause of every atrocity ever committed. Every genocide begins with perpetrators seeing their victims as fundamentally other. As less than human. As objects to be eliminated rather than beings to be recognized. The Nazis saw Jews as "vermin." During Rwanda, Tutsis were "cockroaches."

This dehumanization isn't just rhetoric—it's psychologically *necessary*. Without it, the perpetrators couldn't do what they do. They have to shield themselves from perceiving the *life* in their victims—that spark that would remind them of themselves. They use the exact same limbo state mechanism I've been describing. The same shielding. The same turning away from what they know.

It's the same mechanism we use when we see the world as dead matter to exploit. The same mechanism that enables every harmful act in history—from small betrayals to genocide. There is only one mechanism, just turned to different intensities.

Perhaps paradoxically, the only way to be sure you'd never do such a thing is to not feel contempt for the people who have. It is only by seeing how thoroughly we—the "good people"—have been tricked that we begin to appreciate just how terrifyingly clever the darkness is, just how deeply the "bad people" are trapped, and our profound responsibility in helping to free them.

> *Forgive them father, for they know not what they do.*

> *Let he who is without sin cast the first stone.*

---

## The Real Conspiracy

You've encountered it before. That darkness in someone's eyes when they're consumed by contempt. That presence looking back at you.

Every time you've seen it—whether in the CEO casually poisoning a river, the troll delighting in cruelty, your family member twisted by tribal hatred, or that moment you glimpsed it in your own reflection—you weren't looking at different darknesses that happened to behave similarly.

**You were looking at the same thing, wearing different faces.**

Not the same "kind" of thing. The *same* thing. One darkness. One intelligence.

When you feel contempt, you're not generating a private emotion. You're tapping into a shared field—one that connects you to every other person feeling contempt at that moment. That's why the pattern spreads so efficiently. Why tribal hatred sweeps through populations like wildfire. Why online outrage mobs form instantaneously.

We're not just individually choosing contempt. We're participating in something larger—a collective possession that coordinates our behavior without us knowing.

The feeling of being the noble one fighting the evil conspiracy IS the conspiracy.

In one sentence: darkness perpetuates itself by pretending to fight itself.

---

## Common Knowledge

Here's where it gets truly bizarre. When you treat someone with contempt, something impossible happens. You know you're pretending to be fundamentally superior. They know you're pretending. You know they know. They know you know they know. Ad infinitum.

In logic and game theory, this is called *common knowledge*: I know, you know, I know you know, and so on without limit. That's why contempt lands with such devastating weight—there's no escape hatch, no plausible deniability. The mutual recognition goes infinitely deep.

But here's the truly impossible part: How can two complete strangers share such intricate, recursive knowledge effortlessly? This doesn't get computed or transmitted—it simply *is*. 

The infinite mutual recognition isn't a trick of psychology. It's what happens when consciousness recognizes itself.

Have you ever felt gratitude when someone helps strangers you'll never meet? There's a reason for that. We are not as separate as we think.

*(For those interested in the full recursive structure of how this works—including why it must go infinitely deep to have its full impact—see Appendix B.)*

---

## What Now?

If you've read this far, something in you has already changed. You can't unsee what you've seen.

The next time contempt arises—and it will—you'll have a choice you didn't know you had before. Not between being a good person or a bad person. Between feeding the pattern or starving it. Between spreading the infection or spreading the cure.

Some of you will dismiss this essay as naive spiritual bypassing. Others will intellectually agree but change nothing. Some will use it as another weapon of contempt ("those people just haven't seen the pattern yet").

But a few of you—maybe you—will actually do the work. You'll catch yourself in the act of shadow-dumping. You'll feel the urge to make someone feel fundamentally defective, and you'll pause. You'll remember.

---

## Who to Trust

When I look for who to trust, I'm sensing: what are they serving?

I don't want accomplices who'd have my back no matter what. I want people who are allied to the Light itself—who would oppose me if I strayed, even if it cost our friendship. The ones who aren't hiding. These are my real allies, regardless of their politics or background.

I'm not here to change anyone's mind in the sense of imposing my views. But helping someone see through confusion to their own deepest knowing? That's different. The goal isn't conformity to my beliefs—it's helping each person find their own connection to Truth.

---

## Welcome Home

There is only one war: Between consciousness remembering what it is and consciousness forgetting what it is. Between choosing to look at what's in limbo and choosing to look away. Between spreading the infection and spreading the cure.

And you—reading this right now—are part of the cure. Not because you're better than others. Not because you've figured it all out. Not because you won't mess up again. But because you've seen the pattern. And you've chosen to look rather than look away.

That choice—repeated moment by moment, day by day, interaction by interaction—is how the world changes. Not through some grand movement or perfect ideology. Through enough people refusing to feed the Beast, one moment at a time, in their actual lives.

You can start today. This conversation you'll have later. That person who irritates you. That political opponent you're tempted to mock. That's your opportunity. That's where you can be the anchor that changes the field.

You can be that anchor. Right now. In your life. Today.

Can you feel it? Something in you has already shifted. You can't look at contempt the same way anymore. The pattern has already lost some of its hold on you.

You've seen it. Now you get to choose—in every interaction, every moment of righteous fury, every time you're tempted to see someone as fundamentally defective—feed it or starve it.

The choice has always been yours. You just didn't know you were making it.

Now you do.

# Epilogue

This whole work evolved out of the desire to answer a single question: what is kindness?

I knew I wanted to bring more kindness to the world, to organizations, but in addition to living it—which is the best way to communicate it—how would I describe it?

"The intention to be in service to all of life." Okay, but what does that really mean? Is it enough to just consciously tell yourself that's your intention? Why isn't killing the evil people what's most in service to all of life?

This work is the shortest "description" I could find.

---

I wish I could say that this experience solved all my problems, but it only showed me how much work I still have left to do.

I still struggle with contempt for people who feel contempt. The ironic trap isn't lost on me, but I can't always move out of it. 

I'm still learning how to be fierce without crossing into contempt. There's a lot of evil in this world that **must** be met head-on with great bravery—and I'm grateful for those who do.

Not all limbo material is about harming others. There are still things I hide from myself—ways I ignore my own needs while pretending it's service to others.

As someone whose people have been genuinely harmed by this pattern—often by specific other groups—I know the temptation to point fingers. To say "they're the problem." To let historical injustice justify present contempt. The harm was real. The patterns of oppression are real. But I have to keep reminding myself: blaming the *group* rather than the *confusion* only strengthens the pattern. The moment I see them as fundamentally defective rather than trapped in the same mechanism that traps me, I've stepped into the darkness myself. This doesn't mean pretending the harm didn't happen. It means seeing clearly that the enemy is the pattern, not the people caught in it—even when, especially when, they've harmed me.

I'm learning to remember that what's authentically best for me is best for the whole. The two can never truly be separated. It's okay to feel fundamentally okay. I'm not hurting anyone by letting go of the burden—I'm helping them.

---

I have confidence that the discovery of the Light wasn't a drug-induced hallucination because it didn't show me something new. This has always been there, hidden in plain sight. 

It's a little bit more visible now. Like a plant growing toward light. An orienting beacon. A North Star. Nothing to do with thoughts.

And it's there for you, dear reader, too. You already know where to look.

Look for your fierce desire to serve something greater than yourself.

That's it. That's what you are. That's what we all are. That's what has always been there.

You've always known this. You just forgot you knew.

# Appendix

## A. Note for Trauma Survivors

If you've experienced real trauma—abuse, betrayal, violence—what I'm saying might feel impossible. The person who hurt you caused genuine harm that still echoes. Your anger is valid. Your pain is real.

I'm not asking you to forgive them or let them back in or pretend the harm didn't happen. I'm asking something more subtle: Can you oppose them, protect yourself, ensure consequences, even hate what they did—while recognizing the evil wasn't their fundamental nature?

This matters because contempt doesn't just hurt them. It keeps YOU trapped. It ensures your pain continues poisoning your life.

You can hold boundaries, protect yourself, demand consequences—all while seeing that what they did came from their own unhealed wounds. Not because that excuses it, but because it frees you.

## B. On Common Knowledge and Infinite Recursion

*This section elaborates on the formal structure of "common knowledge" mentioned in Part IV, for those who want to understand the mechanism more deeply.*

Suppose I treat you with contempt. Part of me is secretly hoping you'll become worse so I can justify my perception of you. But I'm not just hoping—I'm *telegraphing* this hope to you, knowing you'll recognize it as malicious, thereby prompting you to dig in your heels.

It's not the mockery itself that causes this—it's a hidden signal I inject into it, which I know you'll pick up on.

Here's where it gets intricate: This ploy had to take place beneath my conscious threshold—or else I couldn't use it to justify my perception of you. Moreover, *you* would have detected my conscious subterfuge and not taken the bait.

How did I execute such a clever ruse without even being aware of it?

Part of what I'm signaling through contempt is that I'm *better than you*, which grates on you. But it goes much deeper. The real reason it stings is that I'm actually *not* better than you in a fundamental sense—and part of me knows that. Moreover, you *know* that I know it, so you know it's hypocritical. 

But here's the twist: part of my mind was trying to *reveal* my hypocrisy, so it must have *known* that you knew I knew. And actually, the reason it drives you crazy is that part of you *knows* I'm trying to reveal my hypocrisy in this way—which means I knew you knew I knew you knew I knew.

Your head is probably spinning by now, but it doesn't end at five levels. The reason this ploy hits so hard is that it *can't* end at any finite level. If it stopped at five—or seven, or nine—there would always be a sliver of doubt left over: "maybe they don't realize I realized that far."

As long as that doubt exists, the charge of hypocrisy can be brushed aside as ignorance—but here there is no such escape hatch: it goes on *ad infinitum*. In logic and game theory this state is called *common knowledge*: I know that you know that I know, and so on without limit. That's why the message lands with its full weight.

But there's an even darker layer to this.

I also know that I'll get away with it—because this deep knowing isn't consciously accessible. Not only can other people not prove I'm doing wrong, my own conscious mind can't either. That's why it sincerely believes it hasn't done anything wrong, which is why I see *you* as evil for digging in your heels.

And I know *you* know I'll get away with it. That knowledge, too, is common knowledge—effectively turning the whole exchange into a malevolent taunt.

Furthermore, the fact that I will use your defensive reaction to "prove" you're evil? That's also common knowledge. You know I'm going to do it, I know you know, and I'm doing it anyway.

Now for the million dollar question: how could we possibly have *common knowledge* of our fundamental equality? Remember, it's not just that we both know it—it's that we both know that the *other* knows it, and that they know *that*, etc. And it works with perfect strangers. How could that possibly be?

Moreover, why is the content of that common knowledge specifically about our fundamental equality?

It is because we are One. One consciousness, peering out of countless eyes—and it can never fail to recognize itself. It can only pretend to. The infinite mutual recognition isn't computed or transmitted; it simply is.

This is why we always have two options: to help others remember, or encourage them to forget. One leads to more Light in the world, and the other to more darkness.

## C. The Metaphysics (Optional Reading)

*This section addresses metaphysical questions about the origin of darkness. It describes insights from the psychedelic experience that venture into territory some might consider "woo," drawing on concepts from A Course in Miracles that resonated with what I experienced. Feel free to skip—it's not necessary for understanding or applying the core message.*

The medicine tried to show me where this pattern came from, but there was no way to communicate it to my intellect directly. It had to resort to allegory. Fair warning: it's necessarily paradoxical.

The Light isn't something you have. It is what you ARE. What ALL of this is.

But it underwent a spontaneous forgetting. The subtle fear arose that it may not be all-good. Terrified, it tried to hide. So it created an entire universe, populating it with "other beings" in whom it could inject its fear and guilt. It began judging them, kicking off the whole story you already know.

But never make the mistake of thinking that your viewpoint is the only one. This is happening for "everyone else," too—even though there *is* nobody else.

And remember: this didn't happen in the distant past, like the Big Bang. It always happens *now.* That means the moment of choice is always *now.*

Consider this passage from Zen priest Brad Warner:

> Even if I want to put this realization down I can't. Sometimes it's excruciating. You know those morons that rammed those planes into the World Trade Center? That was me. The people that died in the collapse. Me again. Every single person who ever paid money for a Pet Rock? Me. I don't mean I identify with them or sympathize with them. I mean I *am* them. It's impossible to explain any more clearly than that, but this isn't a figure of speech or bad poetry. I mean it absolutely literally.
>
> But the universe is sooooo much bigger than any of that. The sky is me, and the stars too, and the chirping crickets and the songs they make; sparkling rivers, snow and rain, distant solar systems and whatever beings may live there: it's all me. And it's you, too.

When you read that, something in you recognizes it. Not as a nice idea, but as something you've always known and temporarily forgotten.

Whether this cosmology is literally true isn't the point. The point is: the pattern is real, it operates through all of us, and the way out is to stop feeding it.

## D. On Calculation, Formalization, and Moral Systems

*Why genuine goodness cannot be formalized*

I've learned I cannot calculate my way to goodness. I'll never know if my calculation is based on self-deception—like when I calculated that mocking my enemies would benefit the world.

And here's something even more insidious: we like to think rules and moral systems exist to make us good people—but we actually build them to offload our moral responsibility.

It's easier to follow a rule than to stay fully aware in the moment. Rules let us say "I did the right thing" without feeling the full weight of conscience. Real conscience isn't a list of dos and don'ts. It's full, unflinching awareness. It's refusing to escape into limbo. It demands that we see everything we're doing, everything it touches, and act honestly from that seeing.

That's hard. It hurts.

So we build moral systems to take the edge off. They let us feel righteous while keeping us half-asleep. "I'm just following orders." "It's legal." "Everyone does it." These aren't excuses—they're escape hatches we build in advance. Ways to do harm while maintaining the fiction that we're good people.

That is why genuine goodness cannot be formalized.

The darkness loves these systems because they let us act from self-interest while claiming we're just being rational or following protocol.

There's an aspect of my mind that always knows, in each moment, whether my behavior is brightening the world or darkening it for my own benefit. Modern society fetishizes rationality precisely because it lets me overlook this part, making it seem naive or unscientific to trust inner knowing. Organized religion instructs me to rely on external authority for the same reason. Both create a massive blind spot where darkness thrives.

This is why the road to hell is paved with good intentions—I'm rarely aware of my *true* intentions. Being free of self-deception doesn't mean I'll always know what's best. It just means I'll act with complete honesty and clean intention. I still need to learn what helps and what harms. That's wisdom, which compassion must be paired with.

If I have some grand narrative about saving the world, I need to check: is it causing me to have contempt for what's right here, right now? If so, it's probably not rooted in authentic goodness.

The most important thing I can offer the world is my connection to my Light, my integrity.

## E. On the Nature of the Parasite

*Phenomenological description vs. metaphysical claim*

The "parasite" language throughout this essay is how it *feels* from inside—whether there's "really" a separate entity or just a pattern in consciousness doesn't matter for the practical work. What matters: can you see it operating? Can you evict it?

Use whatever framing helps you do that work.

In a strange way, even the parasite—even the Devil—is innocent. It's confused consciousness believing it's separate, defending that illusion. This doesn't excuse harm. But it reframes the battle: not fighting evil entities, but clearing confusion.

The parasite doesn't just whisper ideas in your ear—it alters your very perception of reality. You don't think "the parasite is making me see them as defective." You simply *see* them as defective. It feels like direct perception of truth.

The darkness isn't actually a real thing; it's just the *absence* of Light. But the more you look away, the more it appears to be a real thing, so the more you fight it as one, which creates more, and this very rapidly spirals into it *behaving* like a real thing.

In other words, the Devil is a profound absence masquerading as a terrifying Presence. You must neither make it real nor pretend it isn't there. Both will lead to terrible suffering.

# TODO / Working Notes

**[Note: Everything that comes after this point is NOT part of the essay. These are working notes for the author.)]**

---

## Immediate TODO

### Add Concrete Moment to Epilogue

Before the final abstract paragraphs ("You've always known this..."), add a brief concrete recent example of catching yourself and choosing differently. Should be:
- Recent (last few weeks/months)
- Mundane (not dramatic)
- Specific (actual moment, not generic "sometimes I...")
- Brief (75-150 words)
- Shows the choice in action

**Example structure:** "Last Tuesday, I caught myself feeling contempt for someone online. The old pattern was rising—that familiar righteousness. And then I saw it. The pattern trying to use me again. I put my phone down. The impulse passed. Nothing dramatic happened. But I didn't feed it. That's all this work ever is."

## Material to Consider for Future Versions

### "There but for the grace of God" Extended

This insight is crucial but extremely difficult to convey without sounding like excuse-making:

You simply cannot fathom the full extent of pain and distortion that the Light must undergo to become "evil." Your heart would break a billion times over. By the time a person becomes someone who apparently chooses evil, an unthinkable amount of horror has already ravaged their mindstream.

At the very ultimate level, there is nothing special about any one of us—no cleanliness of soul—that would have ensured we would turn out differently. We simply haven't been subjected to the same forces.

**STATUS:** This is powerful but might be too much for the main essay. The gentler version in "There But For The Grace Of God" may be sufficient.

---

### Additional Lightkeeper Material

Current version works but could be more visceral - describing more powerfully what it feels like to be seen and opposed simultaneously, how this restores faith in humanity.

Not urgent unless inspiration strikes.

---

### Pop Culture / Media Observation

How much of our entertainment and media is devoid of orientation toward the Light. Could fit in societal implications section but might be too much of a digression.

---

## Cutting Room Floor

**Material removed during editorial revision - saved for potential future use**

### From "The Battle Is Not Symmetrical"

```
The battle between good and evil isn't symmetrical. The angel and devil on my shoulder aren't equals. One is my nature; one is a parasite. And the devil doesn't just whisper obviously-evil ideas. It speaks using my own voice.

The further I drift from my Light, the more easily I confuse the devil's voice for my own, and the harder it is for anyone to convince me otherwise.
```

**NOTE:** This insight is woven throughout but could work as a standalone quote/pullout if needed.

---

### From "The Real Conspiracy" - Extended Version

```
This is perhaps the hardest thing for the modern mind to accept. We're trained to see individual psychology, personal responsibility, separate actors making separate choices. But the darkness isn't like that. It doesn't respect the boundaries we imagine between ourselves. It flows through our collective psyche like a single distributed organism, using each of us as nodes in its network.

When you feel contempt, you're not generating a private emotion. You're tapping into a shared field—one that connects you to every other person feeling contempt at that moment, and to every person who's ever felt it. That's why the pattern spreads so efficiently. Why tribal hatred can sweep through populations like wildfire. Why online outrage mobs form instantaneously. Why families can be torn apart in a single dinner conversation.
```

**NOTE:** Core insight preserved in tighter form. Extended metaphysical speculation broke momentum but might be useful for a longer/academic version.
