Why do wise people urge compassion for evildoers? Are they being naïve? Or could it be that they see something that we don't?

---

Every one of us has had the experience of skirting our conscience — behaving in a way that goes against our deepest values, but that we convince ourselves is okay anyway.

Maybe we've helped ourselves to "a little extra" at the expense of a company, convinced that we're only harming its wealthy (and greedy) owners. Maybe it turns out that the owners weren't so wealthy after all, or that our behavior harmed many other people indirectly. But our minds found an excuse for those too — or else blocked that knowledge entirely from conscious awareness, to preserve our self-image as the victims.

Or perhaps we were a little bit nasty to someone, convinced that they deserved it — having no deep insight into the true source of their misbehavior, and unable to admit that we just compounded their difficulties in life. We can't see that a tiny part of them was actually _trying_, and that our casual cruelty was the final straw that made them lose faith in humanity. To hide this, we must convince ourselves that _no_ part of them was trying; that they are _fundamentally morally defective,_ and thus beyond help. But it doesn't feel like we're _convincing_ ourselves; it simply feels like "the truth." It _must_ feel that way.

<p align="center" width="100%"><img width="300px" src="./img/half-evil.png"></p>

It is very painful to admit that we're doing this, but it gets worse. If you look carefully enough, you'll find that all the darkness in the world is intimately connected. Every act of unkindness we commit propagates into the Whole, lowering the threshold for darkness to manifest elsewhere. Every act of self-deception makes it more likely that genuine atrocities will be committed by someone, somewhere — atrocities for which we will not only feel absolutely no complicity, but which will actually trigger _self-righteous outrage_, thus inciting us to compound the problem.

This is the secret mechanism by which evil spreads without anyone realizing their part. Each one of us is only able to see the self-deception in others, provoking us to violently combat it, reinforcing it while certain that we are fighting it.

When you look into the eyes of a person and see "evil," what you are actually seeing is a place where all this dark activity has accumulated especially intensely — and a seductive invitation to pile on _more_, in a way that nobody would dare judge us for. Our culture's cumulative self-deception _necessitates_ the existence of such people — and secretly "benefits" from it, because they act as scapegoats to draw our attention away from all the ways in which we support them.

<p align="center" width="100%"> <img width="300px" src="img/evil-above-world.png"> </p>

You would think that the "bad people" are (or _should_ be) especially aware of their evil, but the only reason they can do it in the first place is because their self-deception is especially good at hiding it from conscious self-awareness — and our attempts to violently evict it are secretly attempts to _reinforce_ it in a way that neither we nor anyone else will ever suspect. This is why our political opponents dig in their heels when we mock and shame them: part of us _needs_ them to, so that we and they can continue to act as covers for each other's self-deception.

To be clear: our darkness can indeed suppress other people's misbehavior — at least, in public, and for a time. We can thus easily convince ourselves that it "worked" — but only because we choose not to look too closely at the full implications of our behavior.

> _And no wonder, for even Satan masquerades as an angel of light. So it is not strange that his ministers also masquerade as ministers of righteousness._ —2 Corinthians 11:14-16

From a certain perspective, this cumulative shadowy activity appears sentient; even intelligent. In fact, your darkness and mine aren't truly separate: they behave more like appendages of a _distributed malevolent entity_, manipulating all of humanity from within the dark crevices of our own minds; the places where we dare not look.

It is what some cultures know as the _Devil_ — and it is as "real" as anything you can touch. By keeping our attention perpetually fixated outward, it prevents us from looking too closely "in here" — the one place where we have direct power over it. Its greatest trick is to make you perceive other people's evil as being _intrinsic_ to their minds. **This is the moment of truth. By accepting this misperception, you are choosing to enter your own shadow.** Through repeated acceptance, others increasingly identify _your_ evil as intrinsic. It is an _insanely_ clever ploy — and it is working.

<p align="center" width="100%"><img width="300px" src="./img/shared-devil.png"></p>

In more modern terms, it is the _evil global conspiracy_ — that secret cabal responsible for all the world's ills, yet whose full membership remains forever elusive. It is the _primordial_ evil conspiracy; the one to which all the rest owe their existence, and to which they ultimately filter up. Every single conspiracy you can identify "out there" is rooted in this shared hidden aspect of mind. They feel "shadowy" because they are outer reflections of our collective unconscious. To believe that we have pinned it down externally is to have fallen into its most basic trap.

The elites may well be playing us off each other to take attention away from themselves — but the Devil is playing a _much_ bigger game; one in which even the elites are merely pawns. It controls our perception and models of reality so completely that we can hardly even fathom its existence. We feel that the dark state of our world must be due to individuals who are fundamentally unlike us, and whose violent elimination would bring peace. It is astonishing that we never notice where these dark thoughts actually originate from, and what master they secretly serve.

<p align="center" width="100%"><img width="300px" src="./img/parasite.png"></p>

It certainly feels like there are people who have _chosen_ the Darkness in a way that we have not — and in a way, this is true. But in every case, there is an aspect of their mind that doesn't yet know that they have done this — just as there is within ourselves. In a sense, the whole fight against evil comes down to _recruiting_ that part. Everything else just causes _more._

---

This is called _compassion_ or _kindness_ — **and it has nothing to do with being nice.**

It is simply about being free of self-deception, so that our attempts to fight evil do not have the "unintended" consequence of creating more. From here, contempt (for people) is impossible, because you clearly see the sense in which the Darkness is impersonal, despite people having _chosen_ it in some sense. Hating them for it is always a trap — and now you see why. This is hard to communicate, but we will try.

The secret purpose of contempt is to telegraph our own inner darkness to others, while convincing us that we're doing no such thing. This acts as a kind of "secret handshake" with their darkness, which in turn convinces their conscious minds that we aren't so innocent after all, thus alleviating any remaining compunction they might still have. But since we don't know that we're doing this, we take this as confirmation that _they_ are evil, which licenses escalation. Consciously, we act dismayed by their recalcitrance, but our darkness is secretly rejoicing in accomplishing its goal. 

All of this only works because part of us _knows_ that we're doing it, and part of them knows that we know, etc. — but at the same time, we both _don't_ know. This is also how _malice_ and _self-righteousness_ work. They are always tricks.

Our unwillingness to confront our own darkness is what perpetuates it in the world. Indeed, it is this very unwillingness that makes it "dark" in the first place. **Evil is ultimately nothing but _the willingness to look away_ — not just from the darkness "out there," but from the darkness "in here."**

But what is it that we're looking away _from_, exactly? To say that "evil is the willingness to look away from evil" would be circular.

---

There is a profound and astonishing sense in which we **are** everyone and everything. Realizing this in its entirety is known as _enlightenment_ (en-_Light_-enment), and is indeed a lofty goal — but all of us can sense it at all times, to one degree or another. It is why we thank other people even for acts of kindness that don't benefit us directly. We intuit that what happens to any part ultimately happens to the whole. **You are the Light** — and so is everyone else. This may sound mystical or "woo woo," but it can be known directly and concretely. All self-deception — and thus all evil — ultimately boils down to our inability (or unwillingness) to see this.

This is why contempt is intrinsically self-deceptive: it is the pretense that we are _fundamentally better_ than others, which the deepest part of us realizes is a sham — and which they can sense too, no matter how "evil" they are. It is the existence of this common knowledge (in the [technical sense](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/common-knowledge/): that _they know that we know that they know..._) that permits evil to spread in the way described above. So ironically, evil ultimately depends on our fundamental unity.

<p align="center" width="100%"><img width="300px" src="./img/good-vs-bad.png"></p>

It is still unfortunately common for people to gather and vibe over how we "get away with" things, but the key insight is that this is an illusion: we never "get away" with anything at all. Harming others always ultimately harms us; looking down on them is looking down on ourselves; and forsaking them is secretly a desire to forsake ourselves, because we're not ready to come Home yet. Until we see this, literally everything we do to "fight evil" secretly perpetuates it. It is only through compassion — freedom from self-deception — that we discover how to fight evil in a way that actually works.

**Such behavior need not look anything like "compassion" in the conventional sense.** It may require contempt for their _behaviors_ or _beliefs_.  It may be fierce or violent, perhaps even manifesting as mocking or shaming. But it arises from a very different source, and has a very different impact on all minds involved. Its profound integrity prevents the darkness in others from finding easy justification for itself. **This is the secret mechanism by which the _Light_ spreads.**

At its fiercest, the Light can look almost indistinguishable from darkness — _almost._ They can be hard to tell apart, but our subconscious always knows. It is this apparent difficulty that give our darkness cover to sneak in. But the most humbling discovery is that it was never difficult at all; never truly "subconscious": it was always perfectly accessible to consciousness, if only we had chosen to look. Again, _we chose not to look._ **We chose our agendas and ideologies over our kindness.** This was our fatal mistake.

This is a painful realization, but also the most liberating: all that is required to redeem ourselves is to _choose to look_. Doing this even once, we discover that we never truly _wanted_ to look away; that we never _could_ want such a thing — and that nobody else could either, if only they knew. This firm commitment to Look ripples throughout reality, tilling the ground for others to follow suit in their own time. This is the greatest gift we have to offer the world, and it doesn't require any special circumstances. Every moment is a fresh opportunity to re-establish our deepest integrity.

I wish I could leave you with some wisdom about real, practical ways to put this knowledge to use. Alas, such wisdom is the work of a lifetime, and I am a mere fledgling myself. All I know is that I wish to stop playing the confused game that we have inherited, and to remember what truly matters. I only hope that you will join me, whether we be "friends" or "foes" — and that you will hold my feet to the fire with unflinching compassion when I (pretend to) forget.

The vast majority of what we do to "fight evil" is actually no such thing. It is the darkness in our minds _pretending_ to combat the darkness "out there." But darkness never _actually_ fights itself: it is only ever on its own team. 

Every one of us has had the experience of skirting our conscience before — behaving in a way that goes against our deepest values, but that we convince ourselves is okay. Part of us knows _perfectly well_ that what we are doing is wrong, but that knowledge is carefully shielded from conscious self-reflection: it is "kept dark."

Maybe we've helped ourselves to "a little extra" at the expense of a company, convinced that we're only harming its wealthy (and greedy) owners. Maybe it turns out that the owners weren't so wealthy after all, or that our behavior subtly harmed many other people indirectly. But our minds found an excuse for those too — or else blocked that knowledge entirely from conscious awareness, so as not to threaten our story of good and bad.

Or perhaps we were a little bit nasty to someone, convinced that they deserved it — having no deep insight into the true source of their misbehavior, and unable to admit that we just compounded their difficulties in life. We can't see that a tiny part of them was actually _trying_, and that our casual cruelty was the final straw. To hide this, we convince ourselves that _no_ part of them was trying; that they are _fundamentally morally defective,_ and thus beyond help. But it doesn't feel like we're _convincing_ ourselves; it simply feels like "the truth." We have no idea how good our minds are at crafting our reality to match our needs.

<p align="center" width="100%"><img width="300px" src="./img/half-evil.png"></p>

All the darkness in the world is intimately connected. Every act of unkindness propagates into the Whole, lowering the threshold for darkness to manifest elsewhere. Every act of self-deception makes it more likely that genuine atrocities will be committed by someone, somewhere — atrocities for which we will not only feel absolutely no complicity, but which will actually trigger _self-righteous outrage_, inciting us to compound the problem.

This is the secret mechanism by which evil spreads without anyone recognizing their role. Each one of us is only able to see the self-deception in others, provoking us to violently attack it, thereby reinforcing it while feeling flawlessly certain that we are "helping." It is an _impossibly_ clever trick. 

The reason that we cannot defeat evil is that we refuse to see its true nature. A deep part of us knows that to fully expose it "out there" would also expose it "in here" — and we are not ready for that just yet.

From a certain perspective, the darkness appears sentient; even intelligent. Yours triggers mine, which triggers yours, etc., almost as though they are _allied_. In fact, if you look closely, you'll see that your darkness and mine aren't truly separate: they behave more like appendages of a _distributed malevolent entity_, manipulating all of humanity from within the dark crevices of our own minds; the places where we dare not look.

Its greatest trick is to make you perceive other people's evil as being _intrinsic_ to their minds. **By agreeing to this misperception, you are choosing to enter your own shadow, where you won't see what you're really doing.** You become a beacon of darkness yourself. The more you do this, the more others will perceive _your_ evil as intrinsic — and the _less_ you will recognize it in yourself.

<p align="center" width="100%"><img width="300px" src="./img/shared-devil.png"></p>

In more modern terms, it is the _evil global conspiracy_ — that secret cabal responsible for all the world's ills, yet whose full membership remains forever elusive.

> _And no wonder, for even Satan masquerades as an angel of light. So it is not strange that his ministers also masquerade as ministers of righteousness._ —2 Corinthians 11:14-16

Make no mistake: there are indeed people who have consciously invited in the Darkness in a way that we have not, and they _must_ be fought. But even in such cases, the evil is not _intrinsic_ — and perceiving it as such is always the same trap. It's not that they _don't know_ what they're doing. Of course they do — or rather, of course _part of them_ does, just like part of _us_ does. But the only way they can do it is that their self-deception is especially good at hiding it from conscious self-awareness — and also especially good at provoking us into violently attacking it in a way that will empower its true source; humanity's ultimate nemesis.

Hating them is thus _especially_ evil, in that it enables us to engage in much more profound self-deception than we otherwise could — and, by definition, be much less aware that we are doing so. When you look in their eyes and see "evil," what you are seeing is a place where society's dark activity has accumulated especially intensely — and a seductive invitation to pile on _more_ in a way that nobody can judge you for. Our culture's cumulative self-deception _necessitates_ their existence, and "benefits" from it, in that they serve the hidden purpose of drawing our attention away from the dark activity "in here."

That is why a part of our minds is so powerfully attracted to revenge fantasy films and the like. It is also why our political opponents dig in their heels when we mock and shame them: part of us _needs_ them to, so that we and they can continue to act as covers for each other's self-deception.

</p>

To be clear: self-deceptive violence _can_ suppress other people's darkness — at least, in public, and for a time. We can thus easily convince ourselves that it "worked" — but only because we choose not to look too closely at the full implications of our behavior. If you look closely enough, you will always be able to find the fingerprints of your own darkness imprinted on events distant in time and space; events that you normally feel absolutely no connection to, let alone any complicity for — indeed, the very places that trigger the most self-righteous outrage. But such perception is normally not available to us, unless we have done tremendous amounts of "inner work."

If all this is so, then what are we to do? Is there such a thing as fighting _without_ self-deception?

---

In truth, **the only weapon we have against the darkness is our Light.** You could also call it _compassion_ or _kindness_ — **and it has nothing to do with being nice.**

True compassion can be soft and gentle, or fierce and [even violent](https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/dalai-gun/), depending on what's required. It can look like mocking or shaming, and leverage _apparent_ contempt. But it arises from a very different aspect of mind, and has a radically different effect on all minds involved, both friend and foe. It contains not even a trace of malice or self-righteousness (though it can arise from an outrage that is free of those dark sentiments). Its profound integrity prevents the darkness in others from finding easy justification for itself.

Compassion is simply about being free of self-deception, so that our attempts to fight evil do not have the "unintended" consequence of creating more. From here, genuine contempt (for people) is impossible, because you clearly see the sense in which the Darkness is impersonal, despite people having _chosen_ it in some sense. It is always a trap — and now you see exactly how it works. This is hard to communicate, but we will try.

The secret purpose of contempt is to telegraph our own inner darkness to others while convincing us that we're doing no such thing. This subconsciously triggers their "evil detector," which makes them feel compelled to fight back. But since we don't know that we're doing this, we take this apparent recalcitrance as confirmation that _they_ are evil, which licenses escalation. Consciously, we act dismayed, but our darkness is secretly rejoicing. It is a kind of "secret handshake" between theirs and ours; one that you can learn to perceive.

All of this only works because part of us _knows_ that we're doing it, and part of them knows that we know, etc. — but at the same time, we both _don't_ know. It is our supposed inability to recognize this that makes it "dark" in the first place. 

**Evil is ultimately nothing but _the willingness to look away_ — not just from the darkness "out there," but from the darkness "in here."** But what is it that we're looking away _from_, exactly? To say that "evil is the willingness to look away from evil" would be circular.

It is only through compassion — freedom from self-deception — that we discover how to fight evil in a way that actually works.

**At its fiercest, the Light can look almost indistinguishable from the darkness — _almost._** It is precisely this difficulty in distinguishing "fierce kindness" from evil that allows the latter to take control — but part of you always knows.

This is the most humbling discovery: that part of us somehow always knew. We chose our agendas and ideologies over our kindness, telling ourselves that they were more "helpful," and believing it with such intense fervor that we really believed it. We felt that even if we had to face our conscience one day, we would be able to tell it with a straight face that we were doing our best. In one sense, we really were.  But part of us knew that we had no leg to stand on when looking down on others.

This is the most painful realization, but also the most liberating. We see that all that is required to redeem ourselves is to _choose to look_. Doing so even once, we see that we never truly _wanted_ to look away; that we never _could_ want such a thing — and that nobody else could either, if only they remembered. This is complete redemption.

How astonishing that a near-infinite amount of evil could spring from such an innocent mistake, echoing across (apparent) space and time. What a tragedy! We make a firm commitment to never forget — and to serve as a reminder to others when they do. We recall that this is why we are here in the first place.

This commitment ripples throughout reality, cultivating the ground for others to follow suit in their own time. **This is how the Light spreads.** It is the greatest gift we have to offer the world, and it doesn't require any special circumstances. Every moment is a fresh opportunity to _look_.

Maybe we've helped ourselves to "a little extra" at the expense of a company, convinced that we're only harming its wealthy (and greedy) owners. Maybe it turns out that the owners weren't so wealthy after all, or that our behavior subtly harmed many other people indirectly. But our minds found an excuse for those too — or else blocked that knowledge entirely from conscious awareness.

Or perhaps we were a little bit nasty to someone, convinced that they deserved it — having no deep insight into the true source of their misbehavior, and unable to admit that we just compounded their difficulties in life. We can't see that a tiny part of them was actually _trying_, and that our casual cruelty was the final straw. To hide this, we convince ourselves that _no_ part of them was trying; that they are _fundamentally morally defective,_ and thus beyond help. But it doesn't feel like we're _convincing_ ourselves; it simply feels like "the truth."

<p align="center" width="100%"><img width="300px" src="./img/half-evil.png"></p>

It is hard to admit that we're doing this, but what's even harder to admit is the impact it has. All the darkness in the world is intimately connected. Every act of unkindness propagates into the Whole, lowering the threshold for darkness to manifest elsewhere. Every act of self-deception makes it more likely that genuine atrocities will be committed by someone, somewhere — atrocities for which we will not only feel absolutely no complicity, but which will actually trigger _self-righteous outrage_, inciting us to compound the problem.

This is the secret mechanism by which evil spreads without anyone recognizing their role. It is why we feel contempt for people (and not just for their beliefs or behaviors). It is a trick to avoid confronting our own darkness by violently attacking it in others, thereby reinforcing it while feeling flawlessly certain that we are "helping." This generates a dark cover behind which our own self-deception can hide. It is an _impossibly_ clever trick.

<p align="center" width="100%"> <img width="300px" src="img/evil-above-world.png"> </p>

The reason we "can't" defeat evil as a society is that a deep part of us knows that fully exposing it "out there" would also expose it "in here" — and we are not ready for that just yet. Contempt is our way of _pretending_ to expose it.

> _For so long as the root of wickedness is hidden, it is strong. But when it is recognized, it is dissolved. When it is revealed, it perishes. ... It is powerful because we have not recognized it._ — The Gospel of Philip

From a certain perspective, the darkness appears sentient; even intelligent. Yours triggers mine, which triggers yours, etc., almost as though they are _allied_. In fact, if you look closely, you'll see that your darkness and mine aren't truly separate: they behave more like appendages of a _distributed malevolent entity_, manipulating all of humanity from within the dark crevices of our own minds; the places where we dare not look.

It is what some cultures know as the _Devil_ — and it is as "real" as anything you can touch. It keeps our attention perpetually fixated outward, so that we never look too closely "in here" — the one place where we have direct power over it. Its greatest trick is to make you perceive other people's evil as being _intrinsic_ to their minds. **By agreeing to this misperception, you are choosing to enter your own shadow, where you won't see what you're really doing.** You thereby become a beacon of darkness yourself. The more you do this, the more others will perceive _your_ evil as intrinsic — and the _less_ you will recognize it in yourself.

<p align="center" width="100%"><img width="300px" src="./img/shared-devil.png"></p>

In more modern terms, it is the _evil global conspiracy_ — that secret cabal responsible for all the world's ills, yet whose full membership remains forever elusive. It is the _primordial_ evil conspiracy; the one to which all the rest owe their existence, and to which they ultimately filter up — and _we_ are its minions. All the conspiracies you can identify "out there" are rooted in this shared hidden aspect of mind. They feel "shadowy" because they are outer reflections of our collective unconscious. To believe that you have pinned it down externally is to fall into its most basic trap.

"The elites" may well be playing us off each other to take attention away from themselves — but the Devil is playing a _much_ bigger game; one in which even the elites are merely pawns. It controls our perception and models of reality so completely that we can hardly even fathom its existence. We feel that the dark state of our world must be due to individuals who are fundamentally unlike us, and whose violent elimination would therefore bring peace. It is astonishing that we never notice where these dark thoughts actually originate from, and what master they secretly serve.

> _And no wonder, for even Satan masquerades as an angel of light. So it is not strange that his ministers also masquerade as ministers of righteousness._ —2 Corinthians 11:14-16

Make no mistake: there are indeed people who have consciously invited in the Darkness in a way that we have not, and they _must_ be fought relentlessly. But even in such cases, the evil is not _intrinsic_ — and perceiving it as such is always the same trap. It's not that they _don't know_ what they're doing. Of course they do — or rather, of course _part of them_ does, just like part of _us_ does. But the only way they can do it is that their self-deception is especially good at hiding it from conscious self-awareness — and also especially good at provoking us into violently attacking it in a way that will empower its true source; humanity's ultimate nemesis.

Hating them is thus _especially_ evil, in that it enables us to engage in much more profound self-deception than we otherwise could — and, by definition, be much less aware that we are doing so. When you look in their eyes and see "evil," what you are seeing is a place where society's dark activity has accumulated especially intensely — and a seductive invitation to pile on _more_ in a way that nobody can judge you for. Our culture's cumulative self-deception _necessitates_ their existence, and "benefits" from it, in that they serve the hidden purpose of drawing our attention away from the dark activity "in here."

That is why a part of our minds is so powerfully attracted to revenge fantasy films and the like. It is also why our political opponents dig in their heels when we mock and shame them: part of us _needs_ them to, so that we and they can continue to act as covers for each other's self-deception.

</p>

To be clear: self-deceptive violence _can_ suppress other people's darkness — at least, in public, and for a time. We can thus easily convince ourselves that it "worked" — but only because we choose not to look too closely at the full implications of our behavior. If you look closely enough, you will always be able to find the fingerprints of your own darkness imprinted on events distant in time and space; events that you normally feel absolutely no connection to, let alone any complicity for — indeed, the very places that trigger the most self-righteous outrage. But such perception is normally not available to us, unless we have done tremendous amounts of "inner work."

If all this is so, then what are we to do? Is there such a thing as fighting _without_ self-deception?

---

In truth, **the only weapon we have against the darkness is our Light.** You could also call it _compassion_ or _kindness_ — **and it has nothing to do with being nice.**

True compassion can be soft and gentle, or fierce and [even violent](https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/dalai-gun/), depending on what's required. It can look like mocking or shaming, and leverage _apparent_ contempt. But it arises from a very different aspect of mind, and has a radically different effect on all minds involved, both friend and foe. It contains not even a trace of malice or self-righteousness (though it can arise from an outrage that is free of those dark sentiments). Its profound integrity prevents the darkness in others from finding easy justification for itself.

Compassion is simply about being free of self-deception, so that our attempts to fight evil do not have the "unintended" consequence of creating more. From here, genuine contempt (for people) is impossible, because you clearly see the sense in which the Darkness is impersonal, despite people having _chosen_ it in some sense. It is always a trap.

**Evil is ultimately nothing but _the willingness to look away_ — not just from the darkness "out there," but from the darkness "in here."** But what is it that we're looking away _from_, exactly? To say that "evil is the willingness to look away from evil" would be circular.

---

There is a profound and astonishing sense in which we **are** everyone and everything. Realizing this in its entirety is known as _enlightenment_ (en-_Light_-enment), and is indeed a lofty goal — but all of us can sense it at all times, to one degree or another. It is why we sometimes thank other people for acts of kindness that don't benefit us directly. We intuit that what happens to any part ultimately happens to the whole. **You are the Light** — and so is everyone else. This may sound mystical or "woo woo," but it can be known directly and concretely. All self-deception — and thus all evil — ultimately boils down to our inability (or unwillingness) to see this.

Contempt is intrinsically self-deceptive: it is the pretense that we are _fundamentally better_ than others, which the deepest part of us knows is a sham — and which they can sense too, no matter how "evil" they are. This is what enables it to work: simply by showing (genuine) contempt, we are telegraphing our own self-deception to them while hiding it from ourselves, thus giving their self-deception a "hook" by which to justify itself, while giving ourselves plausible deniability.

(Ironically, this only works because of our fundamental unity. It is how [we know that they know that we know... etc.](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/common-knowledge/), which is what guarantees that it will work.)

<p align="center" width="100%"><img width="300px" src="./img/good-vs-bad.png"></p>

Harming the world always ultimately harms us; looking down on people is looking down on ourselves; and forsaking them is secretly a desire to forsake ourselves, because we're not ready to come Home yet. That's all evil ultimately _is_. Until we see this, literally everything we do to "fight evil" secretly perpetuates it. It is only through compassion — freedom from self-deception — that we discover how to fight evil in a way that actually works.

**At its fiercest, the Light can look almost indistinguishable from the darkness — _almost._** It is precisely this difficulty in distinguishing "fierce kindness" from evil that allows the latter to take control — but part of you always knows.

This is the most humbling discovery: that part of us somehow always knew. We chose our agendas and ideologies over our kindness, telling ourselves that they were more "helpful," and believing it with such intense fervor that we really believed it. We felt that even if we had to face our conscience one day, we would be able to tell it with a straight face that we were doing our best. In one sense, we really were.  But part of us knew that we had no leg to stand on when looking down on others.

This is the most painful realization, but also the most liberating. We see that all that is required to redeem ourselves is to _choose to look_. Doing so even once, we see that we never truly _wanted_ to look away; that we never _could_ want such a thing — and that nobody else could either, if only they remembered. This is complete redemption.

How astonishing that a near-infinite amount of evil could spring from such an innocent mistake, echoing across (apparent) space and time. What a tragedy! We make a firm commitment to never forget — and to serve as a reminder to others when they do. We recall that this is why we are here in the first place.

This commitment ripples throughout reality, cultivating the ground for others to follow suit in their own time. **This is how the Light spreads.** It is the greatest gift we have to offer the world, and it doesn't require any special circumstances. Every moment is a fresh opportunity to _look_.

---

I wish I could leave you with some wisdom about real, practical ways to put this knowledge to use. Alas, such wisdom is the work of a lifetime, and I am a mere fledgling myself. All I know is that I wish to stop playing the confused game that we have inherited from time immemorial, and to remember why I am here. I only hope that you will offer your Light when I inevitably forget — and that it will be as fierce as necessary to help me remember.

> _Be kind, for everyone you meet is fighting a great battle._ —Author unknown

Looking at the state of the world, you could be forgiven for believing that there's an _evil global conspiracy_ pulling the strings from behind the scenes. In a sense, there is — but it's not the one that you're probably thinking of.

---

People are only able to cause harm due to a kind of self-deception: part of them knows _perfectly well_ that they are doing wrong, but the full implications of their behavior are carefully shielded from conscious self-reflection. All they hear are their own clever justifications. It is this secret mechanism that has enabled _all the evil there ever was_ — and it has enabled our own misbehavior too, if we're honest. Every one of us has skirted our conscience before, pretending either that we couldn't hear it or that we didn't have to listen.

Our self-deception hides itself from us while tricking us into perceiving other people's as _intrinsic evil_. This makes us violently attack them, which they subconsciously recognize as self-deception, making them perceive _us_ as evil, which they then use as further justification for their misbehavior. _This is what we secretly wanted_. Their recalcitrance, combined with our "inability" to see that we provoked it, together serve as "proof" that they are evil, thus licensing us to escalate.

This is just one of a million clever little ways that the darkness "in here" amplifies the darkness "out there" while hiding itself from us. Every act of self-deception lowers the threshold for darkness to manifest elsewhere, so that we will not only feel no connection to it, but will feel compelled to pile on _more._ It keeps us fixated on the darkness "out there" specifically so that we never notice what is happening "in here." It is such a clever trap that it almost smells... designed.

<p align="center" width="100%"><img width="300px" src="./img/half-evil.png"></p>

In truth, there is no darkness "in here" and darkness "out there"; there is only the one _Darkness_, behaving like a distributed malevolent entity, flowing freely between minds, shape-shifting at every turn, tricking us into tilting at windmills. Just when you think you've caught a hold of it in someone else's mind, it sneaks out the back door of theirs and enters through yours. You have unknowingly invited it in — and once it is there, you are completely at its mercy; your internal detectors having been taken offline.

This is what we are sensing when we suspect an "evil global conspiracy." It is the _primordial_ evil conspiracy; the one to which all the rest owe their existence, and to which they ultimately filter up. Almost everything we do to "fight" it is secretly in its service. It is made of the disowned aspects of all of our minds working together. We will never fully unearth it "out there" until it has been excavated "in here."  You can treat this as an allegory, but you can also learn to perceive it clearly and directly.

> _For so long as the root of wickedness is hidden, it is strong. But when it is recognized, it is dissolved. When it is revealed, it perishes. ... It is powerful because we have not recognized it._ — The Gospel of Philip

Everything comes down to detecting its dark presence in your mind. At a coarse level, it feels like malice, contempt (for people), or self-righteousness. These are _always_ hidden attempts to darken the world. At a more subtle level, it feels like selfishness and entitlement. Subtler still, like apathy. Your deepest desire is to shine your Light powerfully into this world. It hijacks this noble intention, replacing it with clever counterfeits — such as the violent urge to hunt down other people's darkness.

<p align="center" width="100%"><img width="300px" src="./img/parasite.png"></p>

This is a subtle point, and easily misunderstood. Your Light can indeed hunt down and defeat the Darkness in others, but it does this by showing you how it is _not_ intrinsic to their minds. Contempt is replaced by a fierce compassion. It is as though you are suddenly granted perception of a previously-concealed route through their inner madness; through lifetimes of confusion. When the Light enters that secret place, they remember that they _don't want to be doing this,_ and the Darkness slowly loses its grip.

This is how the Light spreads.

> _And no wonder, for even Satan masquerades as an angel of light. So it is not strange that his ministers also masquerade as ministers of righteousness._ —2 Corinthians 11:14-16

The "evil global conspiracy" hinges entirely on our inability to stay firmly committed to our own Light for long enough to discover this hidden possibility. Every time any one of us steps back into the Darkness; gives in to our self-deception; we hide it a little more from collective view, thus inducing others to throw in the towel. Our greatest gift to this world is to _hold the line_; to refuse to enter the Darkness at any cost. Our own ability to do this has depended on the grace of countless others, such as those who have shown us kindness even when we didn't "deserve" it. We can in turn share that grace and hold the Light for others, _especially_ when they themselves cannot. _It is what we are here for._

This has nothing to do with being nice or gentle. The Light can be fierce; even [violent](https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/dalai-gun/) if the situation warrants it. It can take almost any form whatsoever. Indeed, the more entrenched the Darkness it is "battling," the more it begins to look outwardly like Darkness itself — and thus the easier it gets to lie to ourselves about our true intentions. This is how the Darkness keeps sneaking in the back door of our minds.

> _I wish I could show you, when you are lonely or in darkness, the astonishing Light of your own Being._ —Hafiz of Shiraz

At the ultimate level, you _are_ everyone and everything, in a profound and surprising sense. Realizing this in its entirety is known as _enlightenment_ (en-Light-enment), but all of us can sense it to some degree or another at all times. It is why we sometimes thank others for being generous with strangers even when no (apparent) benefit accrues to us. At some level, we can feel that what happens to any of us affects all of us.

Our true enemy is never other people, but the darkness in all of our minds. The more we heal our own, the more we perceive what is preventing others from giving up theirs, finally enabling us to fight evil in ways that don't secretly reinforce it. Forsaking any one of us forsakes all of us. We only behave this way because we're not ready to come Home yet ourselves, and distancing ourselves from others is a powerful way to keep the illusion alive. This is the true origin of contempt, and thus, of evil.

I am very far from enlightened myself, and don't pretend to have the wisdom to put this knowledge to use in the truly challenging places it is needed most today. But I do wish this perspective to become common knowledge. The more consciously aware we are of this trap, the less willing we will be to tolerate it in our enemies, our allies, and most importantly, ourselves. The Darkness survives by hiding itself. Let us resolve to give it no more safe harbor in the most intimate of places: our very own minds.

As much as we may want to defeat evil in the world, there is an aspect of our mind that continually sabotages our efforts. Moreover, part of us _knows_ that it is doing this. This is extremely difficult to admit — but it is only by appreciating the source of that difficulty that we begin to understand the very origin of evil, and to perceive the horrifying trap in which nearly all of humanity is caught...

---

There's a bizarre state the human mind can get into where we hide aspects of our own minds from ourselves. If you've ever skirted your conscience before — and who hasn't? — you know this state intimately. Recall what it's like. Part of your mind knows perfectly well that you are doing "wrong," but that knowledge is carefully shielded from conscious self-reflection. All you hear are your own clever justifications. In a sense, you really don't know that you're doing wrong — and you _certainly_ don't know that you're being self-deceptive. It is this dark state that has enabled _all the evil there ever was._ If only we could see that we were in it _while_ we were in it, it would naturally begin to dissolve. But it has powerful tools to evade detection — almost as if it's _alive_.

<p align="center" width="100%"><img width="300px" src="./img/half-evil.png"></p>

Something deep within us knows that the "bad people" are only acting from self-deception, which means that there's at least a tiny aspect of their mind that doesn't want to be doing wrong. But this would mean that we're not _fundamentally_ superior to them like we tell ourselves, and that our cruelty therefore isn't so righteous after all. To hide this knowledge, our mind does something _fiendishly_ clever: it makes us behave in ways that bury that "tiny aspect" of their mind deeper, but blocks the knowledge that we're doing so, so that we can "honestly" tell ourselves that no such aspect exists. This is _profound_ self-deception. But what kind of behavior could reliably deepen another person's self-deception without alerting us that we're doing so? The answer is astonishing.

Simply by _feeling contempt,_ we are telegraphing our own self-deception to the world. Our target instinctively recognizes it, which makes them see _us_ as evil, enabling them to feel more justified in their behavior. But we "don't know" that we provoked this. Hence, our mere subconscious intention to darken another mind actually did so, in a way that gives us plausible deniability. The reason we know this will work, and the reason they take the bait, is that it is **exactly** the same dark phenomenon / entity expressing itself through both of our minds. _The Darkness in all of our minds is secretly allied_, orchestrating countless such interactions. If we're not in direct contact with our enemy, it spreads through our "allies" in its purest form: contempt. One way or another, the Darkness always leaks.

In fact, any time we engage in _any_ kind of self-deception, we are secretly inducing the same tendency in others. This is true of all the million tiny self-serving behaviors that we convince ourselves are "no big deal" or that supposedly stick it to the "bad people" — blissfully unaware that our darkness is secretly _empowering_ theirs as a way of hiding itself from us. To be clear: our darkness _can_ suppress other people's misbehavior — at least, in public, and for a time. We can thus convince ourselves that it "worked" — but only because we're avoiding looking too closely. Darkness never actually fights darkness; it only pretends to, in countless clever ways that evade our detection. Even if we somehow eliminated all the "bad people" from the world  — and they surely wouldn't go willingly — their evil would remain. That's because the profound self-deception required to believe in such a plan _is_ their evil expressing itself through our minds — and our inability to own up to this is reflected in theirs.

<p align="center" width="100%"><img width="300px" src="img/devil-vs-devil.png"></p>

Try as we may to wriggle around this maddening constraint, it is fruitless. _Any_ plan that requires distinguishing the "good guys" from the "bad guys" is destined to fail in the same way, because such a plan can only be hatched by the self-deceptive aspect of our minds. A deep part of us knows this, but that knowledge somehow stays hidden from both personal and societal awareness. It's almost as if dark forces are conspiring to keep it hidden...

> _And no wonder, for even Satan masquerades as an angel of light. So it is not strange that his ministers also masquerade as ministers of righteousness._ —2 Corinthians 11:14-16

Looking at the state of our world, one could be forgiven for believing there's an _evil global conspiracy_ running the show from behind the scenes. In a sense, there is. 

It is the one Darkness, freely manifesting through all of our minds, behaving like a single _distributed malevolent entity_. It comprises the disowned aspects of all of our minds, hiding itself perfectly from view. This is what you are seeing when you look into the eyes of an "evil person." It is the _primordial_ evil conspiracy; the one to which all the rest owe their existence, and to which they ultimately filter up. Make no mistake: there are indeed concrete conspiracies in our world, but they all originate from a common source; one that we each have intimate access to. Almost everything we do to "fight" it is secretly in its service. As long as we continue to believe that it originates "out there," we give it safe harbor "in here"; a breeding ground from which to spread.

<p align="center" width="100%"><img width="300px" src="./img/shared-devil.png"></p>

It is what some cultures know as the Devil, and it is as "real" as anything you can touch. It lives deep in the crevices of our minds; the dark places that we'd rather not look, communicating with itself beneath our conscious awareness. Every act of unkindness ripples through its terrible body, lowering the threshold for darkness to manifest elsewhere; eventually erupting in the form of genuine atrocities that we not only don't recognize our own connection to, but that actually provoke _self-righteous outrage_, inspiring us to pile on more.

Still others know it as "human nature"; the "fact" that we are fundamentally greedy and selfish creatures, and thus deserving of whatever horrible fate befalls us. The Darkness knows exactly how to manipulate each mind so that we feel powerless to confront it, and justified in harboring our own little sliver, for fear of missing out on its tainted rewards. It uses your own inner voice to convince you that it's _you_, but it's not. It is a _parasite_ — and like any parasite, it can be evicted.

> _For so long as the root of wickedness is hidden, it is strong. But when it is recognized, it is dissolved. When it is revealed, it perishes. ... It is powerful because we have not recognized it._ — The Gospel of Philip 

There can be times in our lives — such as on our deathbeds, or on psychedelic trips — when the infection suddenly lifts. It feels exactly like you'd expect to feel if being freed from a demonic possession. You discover that you never _wanted_ to harbor the Darkness — but that you _were_ harboring it anyway, in countless tiny ways. Or rather, you did "want" to harbor it — but only because it had hijacked your mind, using your fears as leverage, and pretending to _be_ you.

<p align="center" width="100%"><img width="300px" src="./img/parasite.png"></p>

On one hand, you are certainly responsible for harboring it, and for all the dark results that inevitably flowed from that decision. Part of you knew _perfectly well_ what you were doing, even as you convincingly pretended not to — or that this knowledge would never come to Light. Now you see how silly that was. The knowledge can be buried for a time, but it _always_ resurfaces — and much more painfully than if we'd simply confronted it head-on at the time.

At the same time, it would be crazy to shame or judge ourselves for having made this choice. First of all because (contemptuous) shame and judgement exist only as tools to _reinforce_ it, but also because part of us — the _truest_ part — never actually wanted it. Not because we are among the special "good people" (a dangerous idea at the very _heart_ of self-deception), but because self-deception is completely un-wantable when seen for what it actually is. The only part of anyone that wants it _is_ it — and "it" isn't ultimately a real thing, though it very much behaves like one. It is an absence convincingly masquerading as a presence.

It is only once we see how badly it has fooled us that we begin to appreciate how cleverly it has seduced others — and why hating them for it does exactly the opposite of what we previously thought it would. Even the people who claim to want it are suffering from something like Stockholm syndrome, and contempt just shoves them _toward_ their captor; our common enemy. The more clearly we see this, the more a deeper aspect of our mind begins to shine through.

> _I wish I could show you, when you are lonely or in darkness, the astonishing Light of your own Being._ —Hafiz of Shiraz

Underneath all the self-deception is your pure, infinite Love for all of reality. This is what you most fundamentally _are._ It is not something soft and weak: that is a lie the Darkness tells to prevent you from discovering its full power. It has nothing to do with being _nice_ — though that may be its natural expression in most everyday circumstances. It can be fierce or even [violent](https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/dalai-gun/) if necessary. It can take on almost any form whatsoever, adapting perfectly to the situation. It is a Love that excludes nothing and forsakes no-one — including the target of its wrath, should that be necessary. It may even look like contempt on the surface. At its most intense, it can appear almost indistinguishable from the Darkness itself — _almost_.

It is this apparent difficulty that allows the Darkness to sneak back into our minds, mimicking the voice of our inner Light. This usually feels like malice, self-righteousness, or genuine contempt (for the _person_, as opposed to just their beliefs or behaviors). It is very easy to convince ourselves that these are signs of our Light — but part of us always knows the truth. Our agendas and ideologies; thoughts and beliefs, cannot tell us which voice we are following, no matter how well-intentioned they are. There is exactly one thing deep within us that Knows, and it is always there if we _just look_. Thus, in the end, everything comes down to _remembering to look._ So much suffering could be avoided if we did just that much.

In the same way that acting from Darkness inevitably spreads the Darkness, acting from the Light spreads the Light. Just as the willingness to deceive yourself entices others to do the same, your deep resolve to _never look away_ from your Light reminds others that such a thing is possible; that the Light is not just a myth. This doesn't magically turn "evil people" good overnight, but its deep integrity prevents their self-deception from finding the hook that it would otherwise use to justify itself, thereby weakening it. Their mind is lost in a story about how this world is a Dark place that requires them to clutch onto their own darkness — but despite their most powerful attempts to provoke yours, you refuse to concede. A sliver of Light enters their confused dream, subtly undermining its whole foundation, and planting a seed that will ultimately demolish it. With enough sensitivity, you can actually perceive this happening. Your firm resolve in such moments matters far more than you can possibly know.

---

It turns out that at the ultimate level, you _are_ everyone and everything, in a profound and surprising sense. [You are the trees, the birds, the good people and the bad](unity.md). Realizing this in its entirety is known as _enlightenment_ (en-Light-enment), but all of us can sense it to some degree or another at all times. It is why we sometimes thank others for being generous with strangers even when no (apparent) benefit accrues to us. At some level, we can feel that what happens to any of us ultimately happens to all of us. In the same way, forsaking any one of us forsakes us all.

People are deeply, badly confused. It is only our Darkness that feels any satisfaction in relegating them to the abyss as some sort of punishment. In truth, they are different "versions" of us, and we are only punishing ourselves. Some part of us is not ready to come Home yet, and unkindness is the secret tool we use to keep the illusion alive.

> *Darkness cannot drive out darkness, only light can do that. Hate cannot drive out hate, only love can do that.* ―Martin Luther King, Jr.

Our own ability to uphold the Light has required the firm commitment of countless others, including those who have shown us kindness even when we didn't "deserve" it — and even when we couldn't recognize it as kindness at the time. We can in turn share that grace and hold the Light for others when they themselves cannot, in whatever form that Light must take given its unique circumstances. This is what we are _here_ for. There's nothing much else worth doing in this place.

I am far from enlightened myself and have no right to lecture anyone. All I know is that it would be a shame not to share this insight that befell me, and all I ask is that you hold my feet to the fire when I inevitably forget myself.

> _Be kind, for everyone you meet is fighting a great battle._ —Author unknown

As much as we may want to defeat evil in the world, there is an aspect of our mind that continually sabotages our efforts. Moreover, part of us _knows_ that it is doing this. This is extremely difficult to admit — but it is only by appreciating the source of that difficulty that we begin to understand the very origin of evil, and to perceive the horrifying trap in which nearly all of humanity is caught...

---

There's a bizarre state the human mind can get into where we hide aspects of our own minds from ourselves. If you've ever skirted your conscience before — and who hasn't? — you know this state intimately. Recall what it's like. Part of your mind knows perfectly well that you are doing "wrong," but that knowledge is carefully shielded from conscious self-reflection. All you hear are your own clever justifications. In a sense, you really don't know that you're doing wrong — and you _certainly_ don't know that you're being self-deceptive. It is this dark state that has enabled _all the evil there ever was._ If only we could see that we were in it _while_ we were in it, it would naturally begin to dissolve. But it has powerful tools to evade detection — almost as if it's _alive_.

<p align="center" width="100%"><img width="300px" src="./img/half-evil.png"></p>

Something deep within us knows that the "bad people" are only acting from self-deception, which means that there's at least a tiny aspect of their mind that doesn't want to be doing wrong. But this would mean that we're not _fundamentally_ superior to them like we tell ourselves, and that our cruelty therefore isn't so righteous after all. To hide this knowledge, our mind does something _fiendishly_ clever: it makes us behave in ways that bury that "tiny aspect" of their mind deeper, but blocks the knowledge that we're doing so, so that we can "honestly" tell ourselves that no such aspect exists. This is _profound_ self-deception. But what kind of behavior could reliably deepen another person's self-deception without alerting us that we're doing so? The answer is astonishing.

Simply by _feeling contempt,_ we are telegraphing our own self-deception to the world. Our target instinctively recognizes it, which makes them see _us_ as evil, enabling them to feel more justified in their behavior. But we "don't know" that we provoked this. Our mere subconscious intention to darken another mind actually did so, in a way that gives us plausible deniability. The reason we know this will work, and the reason they take the bait, is that it is **exactly** the same dark phenomenon / entity expressing itself through both of our minds. _The Darkness in all of our minds is secretly allied_, orchestrating countless such interactions. If we're not in direct contact with our enemy, it spreads through our "allies" in its purest form: contempt. One way or another, the Darkness always leaks.

In fact, any time we engage in _any_ kind of self-deception, we are secretly inducing the same tendency in others. This is true of all the million tiny self-serving behaviors that we convince ourselves are "no big deal" or that supposedly stick it to the "bad people" — blissfully unaware that our darkness is secretly _empowering_ theirs as a way of hiding itself from us. To be clear: our darkness _can_ suppress other people's misbehavior — at least, in public, and for a time. We can thus convince ourselves that it "worked" — but only because we're avoiding looking too closely. Darkness never actually fights darkness; it only pretends to, in countless clever ways that evade our detection. Even if we somehow eliminated all the "bad people" from the world  — and they surely wouldn't go willingly — their evil would remain. That's because the profound self-deception required to believe in such a plan _is_ their evil expressing itself through our minds — and our inability to own up to this is reflected in theirs.

<p align="center" width="100%"><img width="300px" src="img/devil-vs-devil.png"></p>

Try as we may to wriggle around this maddening constraint, it is fruitless. _Any_ plan that requires distinguishing the "good guys" from the "bad guys" is destined to fail in the same way, because such a plan can only be hatched by the self-deceptive aspect of our minds. A deep part of us knows this, but that knowledge somehow stays hidden from both personal and societal awareness. It's almost as if dark forces are conspiring to keep it hidden...

> _And no wonder, for even Satan masquerades as an angel of light. So it is not strange that his ministers also masquerade as ministers of righteousness._ —2 Corinthians 11:14-16

Looking at the state of our world, one could be forgiven for believing there's an _evil global conspiracy_ running the show from behind the scenes. In a sense, there is. 

It is the one Darkness, freely manifesting through all of our minds, behaving like a single _distributed malevolent entity_. It comprises the disowned aspects of all of our minds, hiding itself perfectly from view. This is what you are seeing when you look into the eyes of an "evil person." It is the _primordial_ evil conspiracy; the one to which all the rest owe their existence, and to which they ultimately filter up. Make no mistake: there are indeed concrete conspiracies in our world, but they all originate from a common source; one that we each have intimate access to. Almost everything we do to "fight" it is secretly in its service. As long as we continue to believe that it originates "out there," we give it safe harbor "in here"; a breeding ground from which to spread.

<p align="center" width="100%"><img width="300px" src="./img/shared-devil.png"></p>

It is what some cultures know as the Devil, and it is as "real" as anything you can touch. It lives deep in the crevices of our minds; the dark places that we'd rather not look, communicating with itself beneath our conscious awareness. Every act of unkindness ripples through its terrible body, lowering the threshold for darkness to manifest elsewhere; eventually erupting in the form of genuine atrocities that we not only don't recognize our own connection to, but that actually provoke _self-righteous outrage_, inspiring us to pile on more.

Still others know it as "human nature"; the "fact" that we are fundamentally greedy and selfish creatures, and thus deserving of whatever horrible fate befalls us. The Darkness knows exactly how to manipulate each mind so that we feel powerless to confront it, and justified in harboring our own little sliver, for fear of missing out on its tainted rewards. It uses your own inner voice to convince you that it's _you_, but it's not. It is a _parasite_ — and like any parasite, it can be evicted.

If you wish to defeat the evil in the world, you must first defeat the evil in your own mind. But why?

---

<p align="center" width="100%"><img width="300px" src="./img/half-evil.png"></p>

All evil works in essentially the same way. Part of the person's mind knows perfectly well that they are doing _wrong_, but that knowledge is very carefully shielded from conscious self-reflection, so that it doesn't _feel_ wrong. All they hear are their own clever justifications. Every one of us knows this state intimately well. We have all skirted our conscience before, pretending either that we couldn't hear it or that we didn't have to listen. Our examples may differ in degree, but _not_ in kind.

We don't mock and shame our enemies because of the good it will do, but because they are easy targets for our self-deception. We use them as excuses to self-aggrandize and to justify our own self-serving agendas. But we do not consciously realize that we are doing this. It is hidden from our minds in precisely the same way that _their_ misbehavior is hidden from them. Yet, you can learn to see that your mind is spreading darkness if you know how to look. Our mistake is that we rarely look.

If you did, here's what you would find. Your enemy can subconsciously sense that you are engaged in essentially the _same_ deception that you are viciously judging _them_ for, which makes _you_ appear evil to _them_. They therefore feel compelled to return the favor, which appears evil to you. After all, your intentions were pure. Any _decent_ person would have repented or at least introspected in the face of such goodness. But they instead doubled down, proving that they are indeed _fundamentally morally defective_, thus licensing you to escalate. This is _profound_ self-deception.

<p align="center" width="100%"><img width="300px" src="img/devil-vs-devil.png"></p>

What we cannot see is that something in our minds _needs_ to keep animosity alive in this world, because if all the darkness out there were to suddenly evaporate, our _own_ would become impossible to hide. So the deception in all of our minds is cooperating, conspiring to keep all of humanity mired in darkness, without anyone discovering its true origin within their very own minds. It is impossible to overstate the fiendish cleverness of this ruse. The _only_ reason you ever perceive anyone as fundamentally defective, or yourself as intrinsically superior, is to perpetuate animosity.

In fact, our darkness is not merely cooperating. Our cumulative darkness actually behaves more like a singular distributed malevolent entity; manipulating all of humanity from beneath our conscious thresholds. It is why we suspect the existence of an evil global conspiracy. It is the _primordial_ evil conspiracy; the one to which all the rest owe their existence, and to which they all ultimately filter up. The Christians know it as the Devil, and the Buddhists call it the ego. You can treat it as a metaphor, but it is also as real as anything you can touch. Unkindness _always_ feeds the Beast.

<p align="center" width="100%"><img width="300px" src="./img/shared-devil.png"></p>


Make no mistake: there are certainly people who knowingly embrace the darkness, and who are conspiring to bring great harm — and they must be stopped. Kindness doesn't mean being nice or gentle; it can be fierce or even violent if necessary. It need not look like conventional kindness at all. There is no particular form that it must take. It simply means recognizing when we are being overtaken by the darkness, and refusing to give it even an inch.

> _And no wonder, for even Satan masquerades as an angel of light. So it is not strange that his ministers also masquerade as ministers of righteousness._ —2 Corinthians 11:14-16

How can you recognize that the darkness has infiltrated your mind? It can be extremely tricky. It usually begins with the perception that the evil in others is somehow _intrinsic_ to their minds. It feels like you have finally caught a hold of the darkness, and must _punish_ it. And because their darkness appears inseparable from their very being, you must punish _them._ But this is an illusion. The very deepest aspect of your mind is always able to perceive the part of theirs that is uncorrupted and uncorruptible — even when they cannot consciously detect it in themselves. It is only ever the darkness in your own mind that shields you from seeing this, because when you do see it, all malice evaporates from your mind and your blinding Light is revealed — the one thing that actually knows how to dispel the darkness.

This Light is what you _are_ in your innermost being. It is the Christ within; your Buddha-nature. It simply cannot _feel_ malice, contempt, or self-righteousness toward anybody, because it sees their inner Light too, no matter how hidden. It sees how their minds have been enslaved by the darkness, and how to free them of it. But while your inner Light is a real thing — indeed, the realest _possible_ thing — the darkness is ultimately an illusion and can thus always be dispelled. It is nothing but the _absence_ of the Light. Humans are not _fundamentally_ greedy or selfish, even if our darkness is so deeply entrenched that it appears convincingly otherwise. It can be undone, and we each have a role to play in undoing it.

---

> _I wish I could show you, when you are lonely or in darkness, the astonishing Light of your own Being._ —Hafiz of Shiraz

At the very deepest level, nobody could ever actually _want_ to turn away from their Light, because it is the very fulfillment they unknowingly seek. But for reasons unknown, the Light sometimes undergoes a spontaneous apparent separation from itself. When this occurs, the mind becomes confused, fearing that it somehow caused this separation. This kernel of guilt makes it want to hide from the Light, but there is nowhere to run. This triggers a runaway process in which it must increasingly convince itself that it *is* the Light, to avoid confronting that primordial yet illusory guilt. Having thus convinced itself of its own righteousness, it roams the world, hunting down those who refuse to "_see_ the light."

In other words, our decision to see other people as defective is nothing but fear of our own enlightenment, and by giving it credence, we further distance ourselves and them from the peace we most deeply long for. It is a tragic mistake of the highest order. In fact, the reality you perceive as external to yourself is nothing but a projection of your own confusion. I know this is hard to swallow, but you may take a hint from neuroscience, which confirms that our perceived reality is a kind of hallucination. It turns out you can learn to introspect and get to the heart of this illusion. There, you discover the astonishing truth: that you _are_ everyone and everything, just pretending that you're not. Harming the world always harms yourself, and by forsaking others, you are only forsaking yourself. You cannot ultimately "get away" with anything, so why bother trying? You might as well just save yourself lifetimes of needless suffering and head toward the Light _now_.

Even if this seems far-fetched to you now, something deep within you knows that it is only ever your Love that nudges us all toward the more beautiful world our hearts know is possible. Everything else either just shuffles the bits around or drives us further away. It may then appear convincingly as though we are making progress, but it is an illusion. So remember your inner Light, and resolve never to stray from it, under any circumstances. For when your perceived reality is withdrawn back into the Light from whence it arose — in other words, what we commonly know as "death" — you will remember that all else was merely distraction, and that you somehow always knew this, all along, even when you pretended not to.

May all beings be free from suffering and its causes. Amen.

Evil is a kind of mind virus, and the way it works is impossibly clever. It shields us from perceiving the harmful aspects of our own behaviors while highly sensitizing us to those of others. The result is that we viciously attack them for it, not realizing that this itself is only a manifestation of our own darkness. Our own parasite is loudly telegraphing its existence to our enemy in order to provoke theirs, which we can then blame them for. The truth is that they are perceiving genuine darkness in us — the very thing that we are contemptuously judging them for. But we cannot admit this, because then we would have no leg to stand on. Indeed, the whole purpose of contempt is to drive the parasite so deeply into their minds that we can convince ourselves that it is not merely a parasite, but actually _intrinsic_ to their minds; that they are _fundamentally_ defective and thus beyond help. The more we do this, the easier it becomes to overlook the self-serving aspects of our own actions and agendas.

This is the trap in which the whole world is caught; darkness provoking darkness at every turn without anyone recognizing their own complicity. We each feel like we are advancing our righteous agendas, but the only real winner is the darkness itself. This is why we sometimes suspect the existence of an "evil global conspiracy." The parasites in all of our minds are conspiring, together behaving more like a singular _distributed malevolent entity_, manipulating all of humanity from beneath our conscious thresholds. The Christians know it as the Devil, and the Buddhists call it the ego. You can treat it as a metaphor, but it is also as real as anything you can touch. It is the _primordial_ evil conspiracy; the one to which all the rest owe their existence, and to which they ultimately filter up. Every act of unkindness we have ever perpetrated on _anyone_ has secretly been in its service — and part of us has always known this. But this knowledge rarely reaches conscious awareness. We only hear the part of our mind that cleverly calculates how our behavior was a net good. The knowledge of our darkness exists in a kind of limbo state, but we _can_ learn to become fully conscious of it. When we do, something astonishing happens.

---

When the darkness lifts, it feels exactly like you'd imagine feeling being freed of a demonic possession. Underneath it is a Light so vast it defies description. It is what you most essentially are. You see that you never truly wanted to cause harm; never _could_ want such a thing — nor, surprisingly, could anybody else. In fact, it turns out that you _are_ everyone and everything else, just pretending that you're not. One consciousness, looking out through countless eyes.  There are many ways to say this, all of which sound absurd to the rational mind, but the deepest part of you knows it to be true. When you fully unveil the Light in yourself, you automatically see it in everyone else — including those who normally seem not to have any. This is what the darkness is trying to hide. Every selfish act ultimately harms you, and every selfless act benefits you — the _real_ you, so to speak. This is what humanity is slowly waking up to. But make no mistake: it is not all rainbows and sunshine.

You discover that you could _always_ perceive the Light in others — and thus you knew perfectly well that you were only shoving them deeper into the abyss; smothering their inner Light as it desperately (if unskillfully) tried to free itself of its shackles. You knew that you could get away with this, because almost nobody else could consciously perceive it: they, too, saw only "bad person." But there were always those with the eyes to see. They knew what you were doing — and yet, sinister as it was, they still held the Light for you, knowing that the real you could never want to do it. Sometimes this may have required tough love, but it was always love. It is only thanks to their profound grace that you've found your way out of the bewildering maze of mirrors that is the darkness. Yet they, too, cannot take credit for it; for this grace utterly transcends personal achievement.

You now stand face-to-face with all the harm you've ever perpetrated on the world since time immemorial, and it is far more than you could hope to clean up in a single lifetime. Seeing this hurts more than you can fathom. How widely and quickly it spread! The darkness exploited your fear and pride, enabling you to do things you couldn't have if only you had seen what was really happening. You lost contact with your absolute goodness, and went out searching for it _relatively_ — that is, by making other people bad. How ironic that our faint memory of our original goodness ends up causing so much harm! Of course, it is still your responsibility to clean it up. Your only atonement is to firmly commit to holding the Light for others, even when — indeed, _especially_ when — they cannot hold it for themselves. Far from being a burden, you discover that this has always been your true purpose; your deepest calling.

---

This is called compassion, and it has nothing to do with being nice. True compassion can be fierce, or even violent, as the situation warrants. Its only defining characteristic is that it is utterly free of self-deception. It does not perceive evil as intrinsic to any mind, and this seemingly-subtle change makes all the difference. It surgically targets the parasite itself, instead of the confused being who unwittingly harbors it. The profound integrity of this act prevents their darkness from using our own as an excuse to justify itself, thereby bypassing their defense mechanisms. The aspect of mind _beneath_ their parasite is confronted directly — something it is not accustomed to. It begins to remember that the _real_ fight isn't between the two of you, but between both of you and humanity's ultimate nemesis. They may still consciously perceive you as an enemy, but underneath, something much more profound is beginning to happen. Such behavior may not be as darkly pleasurable as violently dominating your enemies, but it is infinitely more valuable — not only to others, but also to you.

To be clear: it does no good to pretend that you can see the Light in others when you cannot. This can backfire miserably, as it rapidly degrades into merely being _nice._ Thus, neither pretending to see the good in others nor overlooking it is a viable strategy for defeating the darkness. The _only_ solution is to learn to actually see it, and the only way to do that is to fully uncover your own. There are countless methods for doing so, encoded both in ancient spiritual traditions and more modern techniques; ranging from meditation to psychedelics to shadow work and more. It is also astonishingly easy to lie to ourselves about whether we are actually wielding fierce compassion or merely pretending to. If there is even a _trace_ of malice, genuine contempt, or self-righteousness, it is always the darkness masquerading as the Light. In fact, the simplest measure of how much we are still hiding from yourself is how much we can still muster these sentiments for our enemies; the "bad people." As long as we still harbor them, we are always liable to slide down the dark path that has enabled all the atrocities there ever were. All that is required is the right — or wrong — confluence of circumstances. It happens faster than you can imagine. You _do not_ want to find yourself there.

There are vast and subtle networks of causality that we are normally unconscious of, and that secretly drive the fate of the world. If we pay attention only to the surface activity, we are missing out on the vast majority of what shapes our reality. Evil can look sweet and pretty, while kindness is sometimes violent. It is impossible to know which is which — and easy to convince ourselves otherwise — until we have done the deep inner work that melts the core confusion. So much of human activity is subtly (or grossly) self-deceptive — and any time any one of us engages in it, we induce the same tendency in others, be they friend or foe. Our true allies are not those who push the same agendas we do, nor are our enemies necessarily those who oppose us. At the ultimate level, something much more profound is going on. To divide the world into the fundamentally good and bad is to miss the point. Your true enemy lies within, and the more you defeat it "in here," the more it vanishes "out there." What lies underneath is a profound Love for all of reality; one that excludes nothing and forsakes no-one, including the targets of its fearsome wrath, should that be necessary. Forsaking others ultimately only forsakes ourselves.

---

I wish I could tell you that I have completed the journey myself, but I've only learned enough to see that I am still far from it. Yet we each catch glimpses from time to time, and it is our duty to carry those glimpses into the world as best we are able. I am still liable to mess things up while believing otherwise, and I hope you will hold my feet to the fire when I do. All I can do is promise to do the same for you.

May all beings be free from suffering and its causes. Amen.

Evil is a kind of mind virus, and the way it works is exceptionally clever. It shields us from perceiving the harmful and self-serving aspects of our own behaviors while powerfully sensitizing us to those of others. This makes us want to viciously attack them, convinced that this will subdue their evil. But if we look, we'll see that such behavior is actually our own parasite telegraphing its existence to them in order to _provoke_ theirs, which we can then blame on them. The truth is that they are perceiving genuine darkness in us — the very thing that we are contemptuously judging them for — but we cannot admit this, because then we would have no leg to stand on. Indeed, the whole purpose of contempt is to drive the parasite so deeply into their minds that we can convince ourselves that it is not merely a parasite, but actually _intrinsic_ to their minds; that they are _fundamentally_ defective, therefore justifying our contempt. This makes it easier to overlook the self-serving aspects of our own actions and agendas.

This is what the virus wants: to make us each perceive the world so darkly what we overlook its presence in our own minds. It is why we sometimes suspect the existence of an "evil global conspiracy." Our parasites aren't actually fighting each other; instead, they together behave like a singular _distributed malevolent entity_, manipulating all of humanity from beneath our conscious thresholds. The Christians know it as the Devil, and the Buddhists call it the ego. You can treat it as a metaphor, but it is also as real as anything you can touch.

You discover that you could _always_ perceive the Light in others — and thus you knew perfectly well that you were only shoving the "bad people" deeper _into_ the abyss; smothering the barely-audible cries of their inner Light under the guise of good. You knew you could get away with it, because everyone else was pretending not to know, either, in a kind of unspoken social contract. _Of course_ cruelty and contempt are how we deal with evil! How could that ever create more? But there were always those with the eyes to see. They knew what you were doing — and yet, sinister as it was, they never gave up on you, seeing you for who you really were. This may have sometimes required tough love, but it was love nonetheless. It is only thanks to their profound grace that you've found your way out of the bewildering maze. Yet they do not take credit for it, for this grace utterly transcends personal achievement.

Evil is a kind of mind virus, and the way it works is exceptionally clever. It blinds us to the harmful and self-serving aspects of our own actions while powerfully sensitizing us to those of others. When we look in the eyes of our enemies, we see evil, which makes us want to viciously attack it by attacking _them_. The problem is, this only triggers their defense mechanisms, driving them further into the hands of their parasite. In truth, we were _hoping_ for this outcome, because the deeper we can shove them into the dark, the easier it becomes to convince ourselves that they are _fundamentally_ defective; that their evil is _intrinsic_ to their minds, unlike ours. They're not just acting out evil, like we all sometimes do; no, they simply _are_ evil. In this state, cruelty becomes noble, and we increasingly overlook the self-serving aspects of our own actions and agendas.

The deepest part of us can always perceive that they're acting from a parasite; one that we ourselves are highly susceptible to. This part has a much wiser way of dealing with evil — one that actually works, even if it brings less self-righteous satisfaction. Our mistake was choosing to listen to the _other_ voice; the one that told us we are intrinsically superior. The moment we made this choice, we _knew_ that our behavior would darken the world — and it is _this_ that our enemy picked up on. In that moment, they _knew_ that we were engaged in the very self-deception that we are so contemptuously judging them for. It is as though our own parasite secretly telegraphed itself to them, knowing fully well that their parasite would use it as an excuse to further ingratiate itself to them. In other words, our contempt acted as a kind of secret handshake between their darkness and ours. We may be enemies on the surface, but underneath, our darkness is secretly allied.

This is why we sometimes suspect the existence of an "evil global conspiracy." Our parasites are indeed conspiring, together behaving like a singular _distributed malevolent entity_, manipulating all of humanity from beneath our conscious thresholds. The Christians know it as the Devil, and the Buddhists call it the ego. You can treat it as a metaphor, but it is also as real as anything you can touch. It is the _primordial_ evil conspiracy; the one to which all the rest owe their existence, and to which they ultimately filter up.

Darkness is ultimately nothing but our willingness to turn away from our inner Light, instead trusting our agendas and justifications. It doesn't feel evil; it just feels... normal.
