What is contempt? It is easier to describe than define.

Consider how most of us seem to feel about our political opponents these days. They don't just have terrible ideas; they seem _defective_ in some fundamental way. How else could they believe what they do (or claim to, anyway)? This _fundamental-ness_ is a defining characteristic of contempt; such people are _fundamentally_ beneath us. It is more a feeling than a belief. We may not even realize that we're feeling it.

Genocides can only be carried out when a group of people becomes convinced that their victims are sub-human. It's not sufficient for them to merely be humans with "worse" religions or ethnicities; they must be something... _less_. While our own contempt may not rise to the level of enabling atrocities — yet — it is a milder form of the same phenomenon.

In this dark place, all goodwill is lost.

Mocking our enemies is "innocent" fun, because we get to see bad people get hurt. This enjoyment is quite independent of whether our behavior somehow makes a positive difference in the world — though, of course, we must _tell_ ourselves that it does. Because our "victim" cannot be fixed, they must be punished — and what more humane way than to subtly telegraph, through our eyes and voice, how worthless they are? That is how it usually starts, but rarely how it ends.

The feeling can also be more subtle, as when we are dismissive or uncharitable toward a dialogue partner; or brief, as when we mutter "idiot" under our breath at a bad driver. But if we let it fester, this attitude can wreak far more havoc than we realize.

Contempt for _behaviors_ or _ideas_ can actually be healthy. This piece focuses on contempt for people, which we argue never is. In particular, it is about contempt for "bad" people, as they are the ones for whom it is easiest to convince ourselves that it is. This is precisely what makes it uniquely insidious: it is the last socially-acceptable outlet for our darkness to freely manifest...
