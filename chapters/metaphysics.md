# Ch 5: The metaphysics of good and evil

tl;dr: "Evil" is just a misguided attempt to return to our original Goodness.

This chapter may be hard to swallow. Feel free to ignore it.

Several spiritual traditions describe life as a sort of dream...

1. "Long ago," you lost touch with your absolute goodness.
   - From this arose the fear that you may _not_ be good.
   - Instead of confronting that fear, you projected it outward, seeing _others_ as evil.
   - This gave you something to vanquish to prove your own goodness beyond doubt.
   - Unfortunately it just ended up making you feel even _more_ guilty, forcing you to project even harder.
   - Thus began a horrifying cycle that continues to this day.
   - It cannot end until you return home.
2. When is "long ago," exactly? This is the hardest part to explain.
   - What you perceive as "reality" is actually a kind of hallucination.
   - Space and time are constructs _within_ that hallucination.
   - So the hallucination itself did not start at a particular point in "time," exactly.
   - You only see "other people" because you're still projecting your own guilt.
3. The way to overcome the "evil" in your own mind is to return to your "inner light." That is the spiritual path in a nutshell.
4. The closer you get, the more easily you perceive the true inner and outer conditions that lead to any misbehavior, which enables a healthy response; one that does not amplify evil in the world.
