# Ch 5: The metaphysics of good and evil

[Work in progress]

tl;dr: "Evil" is just a misguided attempt to recall our original Goodness.

The origin of evil can be described on multiple levels. Let's begin with one that fits (mostly) within our conventional understanding of reality.

The deepest layer of your mind perceives the unity of reality, and has no use for malice. Hence it is said that the true nature of mind is pure compassion.

At some point, there was the forgetting of your true nature — of your absolute goodness. From this arose the fear that you might _not_ be good. Instead of confronting that fear, you projected it outward, thereby seeing _others_ as evil. This gave you something to vanquish, to prove your own goodness beyond doubt. 

Unfortunately, part of you knew what you were really doing, so this just ended up making you feel even more guilty — forcing you to project even harder. Thus began a horrifying cycle of projection and repression that continues to this day.

In other words, the forgetting of your _absolute_ goodness forced you to seek it _relatively_ — that is, at the expense of others. You misbehave _because you are good_, and are merely following a misguided path to return "home." The same is true of everyone else — though their paths are sometimes so horrifically misguided that this is effectively impossible to recognize.

Various spiritual traditions describe life as a sort of dream. This is hard to describe (or validate) scientifically, because the supposed "dreamer" lives upstream of the objective reality that science takes as its starting point. It precedes objectivity itself, so is not amenable to the scientific method. Nonetheless, certain scientific ideas have begun to gently hint at it: for example, that your conscious reality is hallucinated, or that space and time are mental constructs[^scientific-ideas].

From this perspective, the above story changes in an important way. The "some point" at which you forgot your true nature isn't a point in time in the conventional sense: it is prior to the arising of the dream you call "reality" in the first place. As such, it didn't happen "a long time ago"; it happens freshly in every single moment, and is the very _reason_ that you keep dreaming up this reality in the only time that actually exists: _now_.

So it is not that you are projecting your fear and guilt onto other people; it is that you only see people (and the world itself) as "other" _because_ of this primordial mistake. Your job is to return Home; to the place prior to when you made this mistake.

The benefit of this perspective is twofold. First, it means that each moment is a fresh opportunity to stop making the same mistake. You can slice decisively through all the layers of misperception and see the unity of reality in this very instant. It is available in each moment that you are interacting with "other people." Second, it is a more accurate phenomenological description of what it is like to awaken from the illusion of separation.

[^scientific-ideas]: For example, there is a famous TED talk titled [Your brain hallucinates your conscious reality](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyu7v7nWzfo). This is true, but what is missed is that "your brain" is itself an element of said reality. The actual thing generating reality-as-you-know-it lives _outside_ that reality, and so cannot be meaningfully described using concepts that live within it.

    There is also this recent [PBS Space Time episode](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OV9MnAZLmMQ) that asks whether space and time are merely constructs of our minds — though they use the word "brains," thus falling into the same trap as above: "brains" are, of course, objects _within_ space and time, and presuppose their existence.
