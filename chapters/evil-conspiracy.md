# The evil conspiracy

tl;dr:
- There really _is_ a kind of "global evil conspiracy," and _we_ are its secret members.
- Your true enemy is not other people, but the evil in all of our minds.

> _And no wonder, for even Satan masquerades as an angel of light. So it is not strange that his ministers also masquerade as ministers of righteousness._ —2 Corinthians 11:14-16

Think of a particularly bad person — maybe from a news story you've read, or from a historical event. Doesn't their vile behavior make you want to discard everything you've read here? This feels like a _choice_ you're making, and a righteous one at that. But there's another perspective to take. That person's mind is especially deeply infected by a parasite — the same one that has infected us all — and this infection is finding a clever way to take deeper root in _your_ mind. It can work even if they're _already dead_.

This doesn't work on people who are completely free of their parasite. There must be one on the "receiving end." _You_ are not the one making the choice here; _it_ is making it for you. The "righteous desire" to discard your humanity is being whispered in your ear, almost like the classic picture of the devil on the shoulder. Only this "devil" doesn't just whisper (obviously-bad) ideas in your ear; it alters your very perception until you are convinced that it has your and the world's best interest at heart.

Treating it like an external entity is a double-edged sword. On one hand, it is crucial to see that it is not intrinsic to your mind. If it were, you couldn't be free of it. Moreover, it is not intrinsic to anyone else's either — and believing that it is is precisely the mistake that enables it to spread. On the other hand, viewing it as external makes it very easy to overlook: you take a glance around your mind, find no "devil" there, and conclude that you are free of it. But the way it hides out in your mind is so insanely clever that I can't even begin to communicate it (though [this movie clip](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gg8JYYyWSPg) does a surprisingly good job).

It is what some Jews and Christians might call Satan, or what the Buddhists call the ego. It is a voice that pretends to _be_ you. To get a sense of how clever it must be, notice how even people who are made explicitly aware of it, and are convinced of its truth, still fall under its sway — sometimes _especially_ so. It very convincingly pretends to be God; your Inner Light; your Buddha Nature; etc. How could you _not_ listen to it?

Contempt is Satan's cleverest trick.

The other thing this analogy gets right is that this dark entity is not constrained to individual minds. Instead, it flows freely between them. Consider what happens when a group of political allies gets together and begins to express contempt for their opponents. The crowd perceives it as a "safe space" for the Devil to manifest, and manifest it does. Meanwhile, the same is happening across the street, with their opponents. And then what happens when these two groups meet? They are _flawlessly_ convinced that they are righteously battling each other, but in truth they are all allied in darkness. 

We look back on The Crusades and wonder how people could have been so stupid and demonic, but we're playing out exactly the same dynamic all over the place today. The Crips and the Bloods; the Reds and the Blues; even [two formerly-loving partners in a marriage](https://www.gottman.com/blog/this-one-thing-is-the-biggest-predictor-of-divorce/). Contempt kicks off the downward spiral into Hell, driving relentlessly toward an Armageddon in which everyone is violently proving just how justified their violence is, and how they are the exclusive victims / heroes.

And it's not as though each "war" has its own Devil. They are all limbs of the same entity, whose malevolent energy flows between its various manifestations that have continually plagued humanity.

It is that archetypal "global conspiracy" that some people fear exists; the root one to which all the rest ultimately filter up. Only this one is not run by a select group of evil people, but by the evil in _all of our minds together_. **We are the hardware on which the Devil himself runs.** 

There may well be groups of "evil" people who conspire to cause great harm, but their existence wouldn't be possible if the rest of us weren't feeding the source — and conversely, it is _inevitable_ given that we are. **Holding them accountable is crucial**, but when we do it with contempt, we are secretly instructing the Devil to refill their empty shoes. Viewing it as "us vs them" is simply the most clever form of Crusade yet, and it is heartbreaking to watch us fall for it yet again.

Your true enemy is not other people, but the evil in _all_ of our minds. Sometimes fighting it requires fighting people, no doubt. But when this is done with compassion, you are not actually fighting "the person"; you are pinpointing their parasite. You won't feel even a trace of malice or self-righteousness. You can take no pleasure in their harm.

People can subconsciously feel this benevolent intent, even if the action itself is violent. Their self-deception can find no justification in you to deepen itself. On the contrary, the fog dissipates ever so slightly, so that their "inner light" can shine through a little more.

## Notes

Any man who has been present for "locker room talk" has felt the presence of this dark entity, even if only subconsciously. 

Some are susceptible to this particular manifestation, and fall under its sway.

Others may try to naively smash it, only to find that it simply grins and mutates —  and infects their own mind, by inspiring hatred for the first group (and an accompanying self-righteousness).

Still others ignore it, trying to avoid scenario 2.

Perhaps some recognize the signs of the collective "possession" and have the fierce (and/or clever) wisdom required to stop it dead in its tracks, or even weaken it. It cannot be said too often: such behavior may have to take the _shape_ of contempt or shaming — but it is absent of the malice and self-righteousness that characterize the earlier group.

It is natural to feel profound anger for the fact that such darkness exists in our world, but until we understand its origin beyond the particulars, we are liable to unwittingly reinforce the conditions that enable it.
