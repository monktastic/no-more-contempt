# The evil conspiracy

(Still in bullet form)

tl;dr: we are the hardware on which the Devil himself runs.

> _And no wonder, for even Satan masquerades as an angel of light. So it is not strange that his ministers also masquerade as ministers of righteousness._ —2 Corinthians 11:14-16

1. From a certain angle, evil appears like an intelligent organism that lives in our minds, manipulating us into spreading it while convincing us that we're fighting it. It is _insanely_ clever.
    - This is our darkness masquerading as our light.
2. If you step back, our individual components begin to look like limbs of a _distributed_ organism: your evil triggers mine, etc.
    - This shadowy entity communicates with itself through the vast network of human minds, leveraging our collective intelligence to keep itself alive and growing.
    - Your contempt for "bad people" isn't just to see _them_ suffer: the evil in your mind knows that they will in turn make _others_ suffer, etc.
    - Every time you feel contempt, malice, hatred, etc., you are feeding the Beast.
4. This is that archetypal "global evil conspiracy" that people fear is behind the world's ills; the one to which all the rest ultimately filter up. It is not run by a select group of evil people, but by the evil in _all of our minds together_.
    - We are the hardware on which the Devil himself runs.
    - **Your true enemy is not other people, but the evil in _all_ of our minds.**
    - There may well be groups of "evil" people who conspire to cause great harm, but their existence wouldn't be possible if the rest of us weren't feeding the source — and conversely, it is _inevitable_ given that we are.
5. What does it "want"? It escalates toward various kinds of Armageddon: conditions in which everyone gets to violently prove how good they are _once and for all_.
    - This is why the US is headed toward civil war, with nobody aware of their own complicity.
    - It is what [leads to bitter divorces](https://www.gottman.com/blog/this-one-thing-is-the-biggest-predictor-of-divorce/), in which each side feels like the exclusive victim / hero.
6. Each of us has a role to play in bringing this conspiracy down, and it begins with our own minds.
