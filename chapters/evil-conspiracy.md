# The evil conspiracy

(Still in bullet form)

tl;dr:
- There really _is_ a "global evil conspiracy," and _we_ are its secret directors.
- Your true enemy is not other people, but the evil in all of our minds.

> _And no wonder, for even Satan masquerades as an angel of light. So it is not strange that his ministers also masquerade as ministers of righteousness._ —2 Corinthians 11:14-16

1. Recall the "dark entity" from the past chapter that lives in our minds, manipulating us into spreading evil while convincing us that we're fighting it.
    - This is our darkness masquerading as our light.
    - It is why we're unable to defeat evil. We are secretly doing its bidding.

2. Political allies often gather together to foster even more contempt for their opponents. If you watch carefully enough, it is as though their individual entities are reaching out and connecting with each other, forming a single larger malevolent entity that flows between them. This is hard to describe.
    - Then, when they meet their opponents, this shadowy entity grows further, connecting the two groups (though they believe they are enemies). 

3. Any man who has been present for "locker room talk" has felt it (even if only subconsciously). 
    - Some fall under its sway.
    - Others may try to naively smash it, only to find that it simply grins and mutates (and infects their own mind, by inspiring hatred for the first group). 
    - Others ignore it, trying to avoid scenario 2.
    - Perhaps others recognize the signs of the "possession" and have the fierce (or clever) compassion required to stop or weaken it.
    - When the first group interacts with their victims, the entity connects the two as before. (This is genuinely heartbreaking: how could they _not_ feel hate?)

4. As you zoom out, you notice it connecting _all_ of humanity. It appears almost like an intelligent "distributed organism."
    - This shadowy entity communicates with itself through the vast network of human minds, leveraging our collective intelligence to keep itself alive and growing.
    - Your contempt doesn't stay localized to your "target."
    - Every time you feel contempt, malice, hatred, etc., you are feeding the Beast.

5. This is that archetypal "global evil conspiracy" that people fear is behind the world's ills; the one to which all the rest ultimately filter up. It is not run by a select group of evil people, but by the evil in _all of our minds together_.
    - We are the hardware on which the Devil himself runs.
    - There may well be groups of "evil" people who conspire to cause great harm, but their existence wouldn't be possible if the rest of us weren't feeding the source — and conversely, it is _inevitable_ given that we are.
    - Holding them accountable is crucial, but when we do it with contempt, we are secretly creating more to replace them.

6. What does this entity "want"? It escalates toward various kinds of Armageddon: conditions in which everyone gets to violently prove how good they are _once and for all_.
    - This is why the US is headed toward civil war, with nobody aware of their own complicity.
    - It is what [leads to bitter divorces](https://www.gottman.com/blog/this-one-thing-is-the-biggest-predictor-of-divorce/), in which each side feels like the exclusive victim / hero.

7. **Your true enemy is not other people, but the evil in _all_ of our minds.**
    - Sometimes fighting evil requires fighting people, no doubt.
    - But when this is done with compassion, you are not actually fighting "the person." You won't feel any malice or self-righteousness, and you won't get an ego boost.
    - They can sense it, too (even if only subconsciously). Because they can't sense any self-deception in you, theirs is given nothing to feed on, and it weakens a bit.

8. Each of us has a role to play in bringing this conspiracy down, and it begins with healing our own minds.
