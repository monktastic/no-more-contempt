# Compassion

1. Compassion does not mean being nice. It doesn't have to take any particular form. It is simply about being in touch with your "inner light"; free of self-deception.
   - Sometimes it involves being sweet and loving.
   - Other times, it must be fierce or even violent.
2. Being free of self-deception doesn't mean that you will necessarily know what behavior is best for the world. It only means that you will act with complete honesty and clean intention.
   - You still need to learn what is helpful and harmful in which situations. This is wisdom, which compassion must be paired with to be truly effective.
3. While it is surely true that "evil wins when good people do nothing," the only thing worse than letting evil win is secretly joining forces with it.
