# The Light

Reality is actually one seamless interdependent whole. When you see this clearly, you see yourself in everyone and everything. Contempt and malice become impossible. This is not manifested fully until enlightenment, but everyone can sense it at all times. That is why [certain literature speaks to us](/unity.md), and why we sometimes thank people for being charitable to others even when we (apparently) get nothing out of it.

Ultimately, all self-deception boils down to hiding from yourself the fact that **what happens to the world ultimately happens to you**, because you _are_ the world. Forgetting this is what enables dehumanization and objectification — the very roots of genocide. When you meet someone in this state, you can practically _see_ the evil in their eyes. Similarly, when you feel contempt, that is how others perceive _you._ No wonder it backfires.

When all desire for harm (for oneself and others) is eliminated from the mind, what remains isn't apathy or neutrality. Perhaps surprisingly, it is an impossibly fierce and uncompromising love for the world — one that is able to deal with all kinds of situations in a healthy way. In other words, the ultimate nature of your mind is pure compassion; absolute goodness. This is your "inner light."

It is impossible to hold love for the world and contempt for a person at the same time. You must always choose which is more important to you — and as we've seen, the latter is always a trap.

This is why compassion is _always_ the right response in every situation: it simply means acting without self-deception. In the same way that our self-deception amplifies others', our compassion weakens it. Standing firmly in our compassion, and refusing to devolve into malice, serves as a powerful reminder to others of what they also most fundamentally desire (whether they are conscious of it or not). This is ultimately the only thing that weakens the Beast.

It once again bears repeating: this has nothing to do with being _nice_. In the face of great evil, "kindness" in its everyday sense can absolutely be used against us. But malice _also_ backfires. There is a third option (genuine compassion) that falls victim to neither trap. Developing it is the work of a lifetime (or lifetimes...).

All evil is enabled by self-deception, which itself is rooted in a simple misperception of the nature of reality. This means that evil itself is, in a surprising sense, ultimately rooted in an innocent misunderstanding.
