# The light at the end of the tunnel

1. Reality is actually one seamless interdependent whole.
    - When you see this, you see yourself in everyone and everything.
    - It is not realized fully until enlightenment, but everyone can sense it at all times.
    - This is why certain literature speaks us[^literature], and why we sometimes thank people for being charitable to others even when we (apparently) get nothing out of it.
    - When this is seen clearly, contempt and malice are impossible.
2. Ultimately, all self-deception boils down to hiding from yourself the fact that what happens to the world ultimately happens to you, because you _are_ the world.
3. This is what enables dehumanization and objectification — the very roots of genocide.
    - When you meet someone in this state, you can practically _see_ the evil in their eyes.
    - Similarly, when you feel contempt, that is how others perceive _you._ No wonder it backfires!
4. The good news is that this means that all evil is ultimately rooted in an innocent misperception. Defeating it means healing this perception.
5. When all desire for harm (for oneself and others) is eliminated from the mind, what remains isn't apathy or neutrality. Perhaps surprisingly, it is an impossibly fierce and uncompromising love for the world — one that is able to deal with all kinds of situations in a healthy way.
6. In other words, the ultimate nature of your mind is pure compassion; absolute goodness. This is your "inner light."

- > Even if I want to put this realization down I can’t. Sometimes it’s excruciating. You know those morons that rammed those planes into the World Trade Center? That was me. The people that died in the collapse. Me again. Every single person who ever paid money for a Pet Rock? Me. I don’t mean I identify with them or sympathize with them. I mean I _am_ them. It’s impossible to explain any more clearly than that, but this isn’t a figure of speech or bad poetry. I mean it absolutely literally.

> But the universe is sooooo much bigger than any of that. The sky is me, and the stars too, and the chirping crickets and the songs they make; sparkling rivers, snow and rain, distant solar systems and whatever beings may live there: it’s all me. And it’s you, too.
