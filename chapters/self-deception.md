# Self-deception

tl;dr:
 - All evil relies on _self-deception_, a mechanism we all share.
 - Contempt is a form of self-deception, because "bad people" are not _fundamentally_ different.
 - Until we see what enables our contempt, it is impossible to understand how evil operates, and thus to do anything genuinely useful about it. Instead, we are liable to cause _more_ harm.

Trigger warning: reading about how we are "spreading evil" is not necessarily fun.

> _Ultimately evil is done not so much by evil people, but by good people who do not know themselves and who do not probe deeply._ —Roland Niebuhr

 Have you ever done something that deep down you felt was wrong, but convinced yourself it was okay? Really try to recall what that state was like. You knew perfectly well that what you were doing was wrong, but that knowledge was carefully hidden from conscious self-reflection. This is **self-deception**. Part of you _knows_ and part of you _doesn't._ The part that knows its wrong is your **conscience** (not to be confused with "consciousness"). It is the voice of the deepest aspect of your mind.

Self-deception is ultimately responsible for _all_ misbehavior. Even the most evil person could not do what they do without it, and conversely, you yourself are capable of almost anything under the right circumstances. 

When you hear a lying, hypocritical CEO / politician / banker / whatever, part of them _knows_ that they are being deceitful, which makes you (rightfully) angry. At the same time, the _wrongness_ is carefully shielded from conscious self-reflection — and contempt just drives that knowledge deeper underground. Why?

When we perceive someone as fundamentally morally defective, we take pleasure in seeing them hurt (even if only emotionally). We may tell ourselves that the pleasure isn't actually for the pain itself, but for the good that it will do (e.g., forcing them to reflect or deterring others). But this is a lie: part of us secretly delights in the suffering itself, justifying that it's okay because they're bad.

But they can see that we crave their suffering, and so they perceive _us_ as evil — for _precisely the same reason we saw them that way_. This provokes them further. Even if they decide not to behave that way again (in public) — which we chalk up as a "win" — their world has gotten darker, which licenses more self-deception. In other words, they become a little more evil.

But the _really_ crazy part is that we _want_ them to become more evil, because this vindicates our perception of them as fundamentally broken: after all, wouldn't any sane person have simply repented? Not only does this prove that our nastiness was righteous, it licenses us to escalate it — and watching a *really* bad person suffer is all the more delicious. This is **profound** self-deception.

As long as there is a _trace_ of malice in our minds, their mind will seize on it as an excuse to not have to confront their conscience — and part of us _knows_ and _wants_ this. In fact, if you are perceptive enough, it almost feels like a dark entity in your mind reached out through your eyes and into theirs, shaking hands with _their_ darkness. This is the secret trick by which evil begets evil.

**Until we see our own self-deception clearly, it is impossible to understand the fiendish mechanism that allows "evil people" to feel okay about what they do** — and thus to do anything genuinely useful about it. Instead, we are just liable to cause _more_ harm somewhere, somehow, in some way that we will not be aware of. It doesn't even have to be direct (as with a face-to-face encounter): somehow, the darkness in our mind always finds a way to leak into the world.

To repeat an important caveat from the previous chapter: it is not the harming of the person that is intrinsically wrong. Sometimes that is the right answer. But when it is malicious, our minds enter a shadowy space in which more is happening than meets the (untrained) eye.

Deep down, we _know_ that we are not "fundamentally" better than anyone, and thus that our contempt is unjustified. Why does it _feel_ so justified? Because our perception of the world is central to our identity, and if we were to find out that we're _not_ fundamentally better than even "bad people," it would lay waste to a carefully crafted story we've been feeding ourselves.

The more clearly you see this, the less "evil" you see in the world and the more self-deception you see. You begin to detect subtler forms of it in all kinds of places that you wouldn't have described (or recognized) as "evil" before: tiny ways in which we try to shave a little corner off the world here or there to benefit ourselves, or tell white lies to support our beliefs. It has a certain *feeling*, and it is ubiquitous.

As your vision becomes more subtle, an ominous picture begins to emerge...
