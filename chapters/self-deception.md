# Self-deception

tl;dr:
 - All evil relies on _self-deception_, a mechanism we all share.
 - Contempt is a form of self-deception, because "bad people" are not _fundamentally_ different.
 - We are secretly pushing people further into the dark, which creates more evil.
 - Until we see this, it is impossible to appreciate how evil operates, and thus to do anything genuinely useful about it. Instead, we are liable to cause _more_ harm.

Trigger warning: reading about how we are "spreading evil" is not necessarily fun.

Have you ever done something that deep down you felt was wrong, but convinced yourself it was okay? Really try to recall what that state was like. You knew perfectly well that what you were doing was wrong, but that knowledge was carefully hidden from conscious self-reflection. This is **self-deception**. Part of you _knows_ and part of you _doesn't._ The part that knows its wrong is your **conscience** (not to be confused with "consciousness"). It is the voice of the deepest aspect of your mind.

Self-deception is ultimately responsible for _all_ misbehavior. Even the most evil person could not do what they do without it, and conversely, you yourself are capable of almost anything under the right circumstances. 

When you hear a lying, hypocritical CEO / politician / banker / whatever, part of them knows perfectly well what they are doing, which makes you (rightfully) angry. At the same time, the _wrongness_ is carefully shielded from conscious self-reflection. That's how they're able to do it. There is a kind of schism in the mind — and contempt just reinforces it. Why?

Part of us secretly (or not-so-secretly...) takes pleasure in seeing "bad people" get hurt, even if only emotionally. We may tell ourselves that it's not the harm _itself_ that is pleasurable, but the good that it will do (e.g., causing them to reflect, or deterring others). But this is a lie: part of us secretly delights in the suffering itself[^delight], justifying it as noble because they're bad.

But they can _sense_ that we desire their suffering (and that we're not even honest about this), and so they perceive _us_ as evil — for _precisely the same reason we saw them that way_. This just provokes them, and understandably so. Even if they publicly change their behavior — which we chalk up as a "win" — their world has gotten darker, which just enables more self-deception. This "newly created evil" _will_ find its way into the world, whether we see it or not. Mostly we do not — and even if we do, we can plausibly blame it entirely on them. This is how we avoid feeling any complicity for the far-ranging consequences of our behavior.

But the _really_ crazy part is that we _want_ them to become more evil, because this vindicates our perception of them: after all, wouldn't any decent person have simply repented? This proves that our contempt was righteous, and licenses escalation — which is great, because harming a *really* bad person will be even _more_ delicious. This is **profound** self-deception. The more cleverly we hide this secret intent from ourselves, the more it (subconsciously) grates on them, and so the more effective it is. It is an _insanely_ clever trap that must be seen to be believed.

Keep in mind I'm not really trying to describe (let alone blame) _you_. I'm exposing how my own mind works. It's horrifying and embarrassing, but I've been told that I'm not unique. And luckily, as we shall see later, even malice ultimately has a benign cause. Please pardon the sharp language.

As long as there is a trace of malice in our minds, their mind will seize on it as an excuse to not have to confront their conscience — and part of us _knows_ and _wants_ this. (After all, we're supposedly better people than they are, and when's the last time *we* tolerated contempt from a malicious hypocrite?) In fact, if you are perceptive enough, it almost feels like a dark entity in your mind is reaching out through your eyes and into theirs, shaking hands with _their_ darkness.

**Until we see this clearly, it is impossible to understand the fiendish mechanism that allows "bad people" to feel okay about what they do** — and thus to do anything genuinely useful about it. Instead, we are liable to cause _more_ harm somewhere, somehow, in some way that we will not be aware of. It doesn't have to happen via a face-to-face encounter: the darkness in our mind always finds some vehicle to leak out into the world.

To repeat an important caveat from the previous chapter: it is not the harming of the person that is intrinsically wrong. Sometimes that is necessary. But when it is malicious, our minds enter a shadowy space in which something much darker is happening than meets the (untrained) eye.

Deep down, we _know_ that we are not "fundamentally" better than anyone, and thus that our contempt is unjustified. So why does it _feel_ so justified? Because our perception of the world is central to our identity, and if we were to suddenly discover that we're _not_ fundamentally better than the "bad people," it would lay waste to a carefully crafted story we've been feeding ourselves.

The more clearly you see this, the less "evil" you see in the world and the more self-deception you see. You begin to detect subtler forms of it in all kinds of places that you wouldn't have described (or recognized) as "evil" before: tiny ways in which we try to shave a little corner off the world here or there to benefit ourselves, or tell white lies to support our self-serving positions. It has a certain *feeling*, and it is ubiquitous.

As your vision becomes even more subtle, an ominous picture begins to emerge...

## Notes

* If we find ourselves _calculating_ what the most compassionate thing is, that is a good time to stop and check for self-deception.

It's not that calculation is never necessary when determining the right course of action, but it is very often a sign that our minds are trying to justify a behavior that deep down we suspect is wrong. This becomes so natural that we have no idea we're doing it. In fact, I'd venture to say that the vast majority of human behavior falls into this category. It's not that we deep down believe that our business venture is _evil_ per se, but we subtly lie to ourselves about our motivations — and this deception accumulates like a toxin in the body politic.

From this perspective, giving ourselves reminders to "stay connected to our hearts" — which has powerful network effects — is perhaps the single most beneficial thing we could do as a society.

* Self-righteousness is _always_ a sign of self-deception.

This one should be self-explanatory, but if not, it is worth introspecting on.

[^delight]: This is why we love revenge fantasy flicks and those "Watch Karens Get Owned" YouTube videos. Watching bad people "get owned" is *fun*.
