# Self-deception

tl;dr:
 - All evil relies on _self-deception_, a mechanism we all share.
 - Contempt is a form of self-deception, because "bad people" are not _fundamentally_ different.
 - Until we see what enables our contempt, it is impossible to understand how evil operates, and thus to do anything genuinely useful about it. Instead, we are liable to cause _more_ harm.

Trigger warning: reading about how we are "spreading evil" is not necessarily fun.

> _Ultimately evil is done not so much by evil people, but by good people who do not know themselves and who do not probe deeply._ —Roland Niebuhr

 Have you ever done something that deep down you felt was wrong, but convinced yourself it was okay? Really try to recall what that state was like. You knew perfectly well that what you were doing was wrong, but that knowledge was carefully hidden from conscious self-reflection. This is **self-deception**. Part of you _knows_ and part of you _doesn't._ The part that knows its wrong is your **conscience** (not to be confused with "consciousness"). It is the voice of the deepest aspect of your mind.

Self-deception is ultimately responsible for _all_ misbehavior. Even the most evil person could not do what they do without it, and conversely, you yourself are capable of almost anything under the right circumstances. 

When you hear a lying, hypocritical CEO / politician / banker / whatever, part of them knows perfectly well what they are doing, which makes you (rightfully) angry. At the same time, the _wrongness_ is carefully shielded from conscious self-reflection. That's how they're able to do it. There is a kind of schism in the mind — and contempt just reinforces it. Why?

When we perceive someone as fundamentally morally defective, we take pleasure in seeing them hurt (even if only emotionally). We may tell ourselves that it's not the harm _itself_ that is pleasurable, but the good that it will do (e.g., causing them to reflect, or deterring others). But this is a lie: part of us secretly delights in the suffering itself, justifying it as okay because they're bad.

But they can _sense_ that we desire their suffering, and so they perceive _us_ as evil — for _precisely the same reason we saw them that way_. This just provokes them, and understandably so. Even if they change their behavior as a result (in public, anyway) — which we chalk up as a "win" — their world has gotten darker, which just enables more self-deception. In other words, they become a little more evil.

But the _really_ crazy part is that we _want_ them to become more evil, because this vindicates our perception of them: after all, wouldn't any decent person have simply repented? This proves that our contempt was righteous, and licenses escalation — which is great, because harming a *really* bad person will be even _more_ delicious. This is **profound** self-deception.

Keep in mind I'm not really trying to describe (let alone blame) _you_. I'm exposing how my own mind works. It's horrifying and embarrassing, but I've been told that I'm not unique. And luckily, as we shall see later, even malice ultimately has a benign cause. Please pardon the sharp language.

As long as there is a trace of malice in our minds, their mind will seize on it as an excuse to not have to confront their conscience — and part of us _knows_ and _wants_ this. (After all, we're supposedly better people than they are, and when's the last time *we* tolerated contempt from a malicious hypocrite?) In fact, if you are perceptive enough, it almost feels like a dark entity in your mind is reaching out through your eyes and into theirs, shaking hands with _their_ darkness.

**Until we see this clearly, it is impossible to understand the fiendish mechanism that allows "bad people" to feel okay about what they do** — and thus to do anything genuinely useful about it. Instead, we are liable to cause _more_ harm somewhere, somehow, in some way that we will not be aware of. It doesn't have to happen via a face-to-face encounter: the darkness in our mind always finds some vehicle to leak out into the world.

To repeat an important caveat from the previous chapter: it is not the harming of the person that is intrinsically wrong. Sometimes that is necessary. But when it is malicious, our minds enter a shadowy space in which something much darker is happening than meets the (untrained) eye.

Deep down, we _know_ that we are not "fundamentally" better than anyone, and thus that our contempt is unjustified. So why does it _feel_ so justified? Because our perception of the world is central to our identity, and if we were to suddenly discover that we're _not_ fundamentally better than the "bad people," it would lay waste to a carefully crafted story we've been feeding ourselves.

The more clearly you see this, the less "evil" you see in the world and the more self-deception you see. You begin to detect subtler forms of it in all kinds of places that you wouldn't have described (or recognized) as "evil" before: tiny ways in which we try to shave a little corner off the world here or there to benefit ourselves, or tell white lies to support our self-serving positions. It has a certain *feeling*, and it is ubiquitous.

As your vision becomes even more subtle, an ominous picture begins to emerge...
