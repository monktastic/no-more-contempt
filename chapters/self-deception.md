# Self-deception

tl;dr:
 - All evil relies on _self-deception_, a mechanism we all share.
 - Contempt is a form of self-deception, because "bad people" are not _fundamentally_ different.
 - Until we see what enables our contempt, it is impossible to understand how evil operates, and thus to do anything genuinely useful about it. Instead, we are liable to cause _more_ harm.

Trigger warning: reading about how we are "spreading evil" is not necessarily fun.

> _Ultimately evil is done not so much by evil people, but by good people who do not know themselves and who do not probe deeply._ —Roland Niebuhr

 Have you ever done something that deep down you felt was wrong, but convinced yourself it was okay? Really try to recall what that state was like. You knew perfectly well that what you were doing was wrong, but that knowledge was carefully hidden from conscious self-reflection. This is **self-deception**. Part of you _knows_ and part of you _doesn't._ The part that knows its wrong is your **conscience** (not to be confused with "consciousness"). It is the voice of the deepest aspect of your mind.

Self-deception is ultimately responsible for _all_ misbehavior. Even the most evil person could not do what they do without it, and conversely, you yourself are capable of almost anything under the right circumstances. 

When you hear a lying, hypocritical CEO / politician / banker / whatever, part of them _knows_ that they are being deceitful, which makes you (rightfully) angry. At the same time, the _wrongness_ is carefully shielded from conscious self-reflection — and contempt just drives that knowledge deeper underground. Far from changing their mind, they double down.

Part of us _knows_ that this will happen, and that it is likely to lead to even more evil, but as long as it makes us look _good_ (to ourselves or others)[^self-image], we studiously overlook this. In fact, we _want_ it to happen, because it not only vindicates our perception of them as evil; it licenses us to escalate our righteous violence — which is an _intoxicatingly delicious_ feeling. We do not consciously register any of this. That is why **contempt is profound self-deception.**

Our "victim" can subconsciously sense that we're doing this, which makes them perceive _us_ as evil, which causes them to double down. _Mission accomplished:_ our desire to see them as evil has made them more evil, while also hiding any trace of any complicity. That is why we need to see them as _fundamentally_ bad: it leaves no doubt that our malice is good.

What happened is that our self-deception deepend theirs. In fact, if you are perceptive enough, it almost feels like a dark entity in your mind reached out through your eyes and into theirs, shaking hands with the darkness in _them._ On the surface, you may be enemies, but your darkness is secretly allied.

**Until we see how we are doing this and cleverly hiding it from ourselves, it is impossible to understand the fiendish mechanism that allows "evil people" to feel okay about what they do** — and thus to do anything genuinely useful about it. Instead, we are just liable to cause _more_ harm somewhere, somehow, in some way that we will not be aware of. It doesn't even have to be direct (as with a face-to-face encounter): somehow, the darkness in our mind always finds a way to leak into the world.

To repeat an important caveat from the previous chapter: it is not the harming of the person that is intrinsically wrong. Sometimes that is the right answer. But when it is malicious, our minds enter a shadowy space in which more is happening than meets the (untrained) eye.

Deep down, we _know_ that we are not "fundamentally" better than anyone, and thus that our contempt is unjustified. Why does it _feel_ so justified? Because the harder we try to differentiate ourselves from the "bad people," the more this backfires, so the harder we have to hide it, resulting in a feedback loop that very quickly becomes impossible to admit to ourselves.

The more clearly you see this, the less "evil" you see in the world and the more self-deception you see. You begin to detect subtler forms of it in all kinds of places that you wouldn't have described (or recognized) as "evil" before: tiny ways in which we try to shave a little corner off the world here or there to benefit ourselves, or tell white lies to support our beliefs. It has a certain *feeling*, and it is ubiquitous.

As your vision becomes more subtle, an ominous picture begins to emerge...
