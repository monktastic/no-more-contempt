# Psychedelics, NDEs, etc.

[Even more "far out." Have to figure out how to communicate this all without turning people off.]

1. The healing power of psychedelics largely comes from their ability to give you a taste of what was described in the previous chapter.
2. This shows you, in no uncertain terms, that you have _no leg to stand on_ when it comes to contempt for bad people.
3. You try to plead ignorance, but you are shown repeatedly and forcibly, that part of you that _always knew._ You are the worst kind of hypocrite. (Don't worry, we all are.)
4. This is utterly horrifying: you never wanted to become this way, yet one bad decision after another led you here. Why don't you understand the same about others? You are shown repeatedly until this becomes unmistakably clear.
   - In chapter ??? when I said that the malevolence of contempt isn't abstract, but can be _tasted_, this is what I was referring to.
   - Whenever you feel contempt, it was as though you are gleefully injecting evil into your target's very soul, while winking at them as if to remind them that you would get away with it.
   - The trouble is, you ultimately won't. Psychedelics are a preview of things to come.
5. It is ultimately liberating. You _see_ that the source of evil is innocent — both in yourself and in others. You are "one with God."
6. The parting message is something like this: just as you dreamed up this life, your next dream will be hellish or pleasant depending on how much burden is left on your conscience. Clean it up _now._
7. (NDE and the "life review.")
