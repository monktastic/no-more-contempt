# The climate crisis

> _The earth is not dying, it is being killed, and those who are killing it have names and addresses._ —Utah Phillips

Can you feel the contempt oozing from this quote? Yes, the people killing the planet have names and addresses: they are _us_; we who harbor contempt in the name of good.

To be completely clear: people certainly have varying degrees of complicity, especially when it comes to the immediate scope of their actions — and we _must_ hold them correspondingly accountable. But to the degree that we do this with contempt, we ensure the continued existence of such people, even if their details change. Even as we are stringing them up, we are secretly instructing reality to fill their shoes.

As we said in ch ???:

> There may well be groups of "evil" people who conspire to cause great harm, but their existence wouldn't be possible if the rest of us weren't feeding the source — and conversely, it is _inevitable_ given that we are.

At some point, the subtle threads connecting our contempt to their actions become impossible to ignore. You begin to see the signatures of your own self-deception on the ills of the world.

I said before that we ultimately see ourselves in everyone and _everything_. The same misperception that allows us to be cruel to other people enables us to be cruel to the biosphere; to objectify it. Nature is _alive_ in a sense that we somehow don't see yet, analogous to how people once didn't see other races as sentient, and how we're only starting to recognize other species as sentient (first primates, then mammals, ...). It is surely alive in a _different_ sense, but it deserves our compassion nonetheless.

Contempt is the wrong tool to save the planet. Your true enemy is not the people killing the planet; it is the self-deception in our minds that enables us to treat it with contempt.
