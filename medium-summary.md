> _Be kind, for everyone you meet is fighting a great battle._ —Author unknown

> _If only it were all so simple! If only there were evil people somewhere insidiously committing evil deeds, and it were necessary only to separate them from the rest of us and destroy them. But the line dividing good and evil cuts through the heart of every human being. And who is willing to destroy a piece of his own heart?_ —Alexander Solzhenitsyn

> _And no wonder, for even Satan masquerades as an angel of light. So it is not strange that his ministers also masquerade as ministers of righteousness._ —2 Corinthians 11:14-16

_**tl;dr**: There really _is_ a kind of "evil global conspiracy" at work. It behaves exactly like you would expect Satan to behave, and it lives within your own mind. Contempt (especially for "bad people") is its most insidious tool._

It is hard to admit, but there is darkness in our minds. It is not _intrinsic_ to our minds, but is a kind of parasite. It knows that we are unwilling to harm people unless we see them as subhuman — which most people know is wrong. So it uses a clever trick: it alters our perception so that we see the darkness as intrinsic to some people's minds. We call them "bad people" and see them as subtly subhuman, so that harming them becomes okay.

Consciously, we don't recognize that we're being manipulated; to us, it feels like a natural and healthy instinct to violently attack evil — which we mistakenly equate with violently attacking _people_. But no matter how subdued our attack (e.g., mockery), our underlying malicious intent has the effect of driving the darkness deeper into their minds, making it appear even more assuredly intrinsic, which inspires even more righteous violence, in a downward spiral.

This isn't an accident: our darkness orchestrated it. We may not be conscious of this, but our "victim" is convinced that we are — for precisely the same reason that we're convinced that _their_ evil is fully volitional: namely, their darkness manipulates their mind into seeing ours as intrinsic, inspiring them to righteously attack us. Thus the darkness is driven deeper into both minds.

In other words, our darkness tricks us into behaving in ways that will convince others that ours is intrinsic, because it knows exactly how theirs operates and will respond — _because ours and theirs are identical_. In fact, they are not just identical, but are more like outgrowths of a single shared "shadowy presence" that continually manipulates all of our minds; the _Devil_, if you will.

This is not just a wacky religious idea: it seems that everyone who introspects carefully enough eventually perceives this "distributed malevolent entity" which has a kind of intelligence and volition of its own that, even if not _literally_ true, explain its seemingly-coordinated behavior far more accurately than if ours were independent. It explains _so much_ of humanity's group dynamics.

It is the primordial "evil global conspiracy," and it lives in all of our minds. Every attempt to maliciously subdue it "out there" just strengthens it, because such behavior is only ever initiated by it, even though it makes us believe that it was initiated by us. Contempt is its most insidious tool precisely because it appears to be the most unmistakably righteous.

The only way for humanity to defeat the Devil is to stop falling for its tricks. Any time you feel malice, hatred, contempt, or even self-righteousness toward another being; any time you see them as fundamentally defective or inferior; you are being manipulated, and this _will_ create more evil. As you begin to clear up this misperception in your own mind, you discover what is causing it in others'. Only then can you do anything genuinely useful about it.

The topic of what such "useful" behavior looks like is vast and is beyond our scope. Such behavior depends entirely on circumstances, and is impossible to reduce to principles, except for one: the more deeply it is rooted in compassion — i.e., free of the above misperception — the more beneficial it tends to be. Being _entirely_ free is enlightenment; perception of our fundamental unity. (Note that this profound unity is also what allows the Devil to exist.) Rest assured that compassionate action _can_ be outwardly violent.
