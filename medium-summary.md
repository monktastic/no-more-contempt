_**tl;dr**: There really _is_ a kind of "evil global conspiracy" at play. It lives within your own mind, and contempt is its most insidious tool. 

---

Each of us has our own perspective on "what's wrong with the world" and who is responsible. When we think about them, we feel contempt, and if we met them, we would treat them that way. This makes us feel like we're fighting evil, but such behavior tends to make people worse, not better. So why do we do it? Maybe to deter others, but there's actually a much darker reason.

We've all done something wrong while convincing ourselves that it's not. What we may not realize is that _all_ evil depends on this very mechanism of self-deception. We are motivated _not_ to see this, because then we can believe that we are fundamentally different from the "bad people." We treat them with contempt to bait them into behaving in ways that confirm that we are in fact better.

This is malicious, so to preserve our self-image, we hide the true reason for our contempt even from ourselves. This is *itself* an act of self-deception, and perhaps the hardest one to detect, because it feels so obviously righteous. Yet part of you knows that it's not. Seeing how your mind hides this truth is key to understanding how the "bad people" do what they do without feeling bad.

Once you see this, everything changes.

You discover that there is darkness within each of us. It is not intrinsic to our minds, but is more like a parasite. But our darkness alters our perception so that we _see_ the darkness as intrinsic to some people's minds; we see them as "fundamentally bad." It knows that this is the only way that it can convince us to be malicious without compunction.

Meanwhile, this behavior makes our "victim" perceive _us_ as fundamentally bad, because they see it as obviously evil, and obviously intentional — for exactly the same reason that we see _their_ misbehavior that way. Both minds become darker as a result. But the real shocker is discovering that this spiral into Hell is secretly being orchestrated by the darkness in both of our minds.

Our darkness tricks us into behaving in ways that will convince others that ours is intrinsic, because it knows exactly how theirs operates and will respond — _because ours and theirs are identical_. In fact, they are not just identical, but are more like outgrowths of a single shared "shadowy presence" that continually manipulates all of our minds; the _Devil_, if you will.

This is not just a wacky religious idea: I think that everyone who introspects carefully enough eventually perceives this "distributed malevolent entity" which has a kind of intelligence and volition of its own that, even if not _literally_ true, explain its seemingly-coordinated behavior surprisingly well.

It is the primordial "evil global conspiracy," and it lives in all of our minds. Every attempt to maliciously subdue it "out there" just strengthens it, because such behavior is only ever initiated _by_ it, even though it makes us believe that it was initiated by us. Contempt is its most insidious tool precisely because it appears to be the most unmistakably righteous. It always finds a way to leak into the world, where we can disown all complicity for its far-ranging effects.

To be clear: there may well be groups of particularly "bad" people who conspire to cause great harm, but their existence wouldn't be possible if the rest of us weren't feeding the source — and conversely, it is _inevitable_ given that we are. **We must hold such people accountable**, but when we do this with contempt, we are secretly injecting more evil into the world.

The only way for humanity to defeat the Devil is to stop falling for its tricks. Any time you feel malice, hatred, contempt, or even self-righteousness toward another being; any time you see them as fundamentally defective or inferior; you are being manipulated, and this _will_ create more evil. As you begin to clear up this misperception in your own mind, you discover more of what is causing it in others'. This is the only way to do anything genuinely useful about it.

The topic of what such "useful" behavior looks like is vast and is beyond our scope. It depends entirely on the circumstances, and is impossible to reduce to principles, except for one: the more deeply it is rooted in compassion — which just means free of the above misperception — the more beneficial it tends to be. Being _entirely_ free is enlightenment; perception of our fundamental unity. But rest assured that compassionate action _can_ be outwardly violent.
