## Miscellaneous notes

- "Herd immunity to evil": When in a contemptuous crowd or atmosphere, it is very easy to get swept up yourself. But if you're aware of this dangerous pattern and resistant to it, you provide a kind of "buffer" for others. The more people who do this, the harder it is for evil to spread.


- Revenge fantasy films (like The Equalizer) and those "[Karens Getting Owned](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88CqPl_HqS4)" YouTube videos exist only to stoke our darkness. They are a manifestation of our evil—again, masquerading as our goodness. Notice how they feel _so goddamn righteous._ That's it: that's the feeling.


- "Outrage" can mean (healthy) anger directed at correcting an injustice, but it quickly gets corrupted into self-righteous indignation. Similarly, "judgement" can refer to wise discernment, but it quickly devolves into disdain. Just like "compassion" doesn't really mean "being nice," these words get redefined by our evil so that we make a mess of what is actually quite simple.


- You know the classic angel and devil ont the shoulder? The angel is your inner light, and is intrinsic to you. The devil is your evil, and he doesn't just whisper bad ideas into your ear: he alters your very perception.


- When you fight people using contempt, you can feel your evil allying with theirs. Conversely, when you fight them with compassion, you can feel your inner light allying with theirs. It provides them with the safety to confront their misbehavior while not letting them off the hook for it. Part of them (and bystanders) can sense what's really happening, and this makes all the difference.


- Coming into contact with your "inner light" (see [FAQ](faq.md)) provides the profound psychological safety required to uncover and hold the full depth of your complicity in the world. You can then offer this same gift to others—though if it still feels like there is a "you" and "others," there is work left to be done.


- You know how you can sense when someone is out "looking for trouble" — and how they somehow usually seem to find it? A contemptuous attitude is like that.
