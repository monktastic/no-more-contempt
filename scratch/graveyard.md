Why do we enjoy mocking, shaming, and contemptuously judging our enemies? The answer is astonishing. The darkness in our mind is telegraphing itself to the world, provoking our enemies into seeing us as "evil," thus helping them feel more justified in their misbehavior. But because our darkness convinces us that we are acting from noble intentions, we take their recalcitrance as proof that _they_ are evil, thus licensing us to escalate.  <! too sudden !>

It is possible to fight evil using either your darkness or your inner Light — and all too easy to lie to yourself about which you are using, or to convince yourself that it doesn't matter which you use, because your intentions remain confined to your skull. This is self-deception. The deepest part of you _knows_ that your intentions have tremendous consequences, and it secretly _telegraphs_ that knowledge to the outside world, while simultaneously hiding it from you. This subterfuge is what gives it its power. When we mock, shame, and contemptuously judge our enemies, we are intentionally revealing the darkness within our minds, because we know that this will provoke them into worse behavior, which we will then be able to blame on them, because we believe our intentions were pure.

In other words, it is the very action of hiding your darkness from yourself that gives it the power it needs to darken the world. 

<! This cannot be the whole story, or else evil people who knowingly spread evil would be worse at doing so. !>
