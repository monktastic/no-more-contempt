Why do wise people urge compassion for evildoers? Are they being naive? No: they know something that we don't. Namely, that our urge to be cruel to "bad people" comes from _exactly_ the same place that enables them to be "bad" in the first place — and it accomplishes just as much good.

When you're nasty to a "bad person," they don't perceive you as a "good person" trying to help anything. They perceive _you_ as bad, and dig in their heels. This apparent recalcitrance vindicates your perception of them, and licenses you to escalate your righteous wrath.

What you can't see is that your subconscious secretly orchestrated this whole maneuver. Its goal wasn't actually to help the world; it was to prove you right. There's something profoundly comforting about knowing that evil exists only outside ourselves, and that all we have to do is smash it. When we encounter a "bad person," it feels like we've found one of evil's secret bastions, and it's our duty to terminate it with extreme prejudice. Unfortunately, this is a complete fabrication.

All the darkness in the world is intimately connected, and part of it lives firmly within your very own mind. It hides itself from your consciousness in _insanely_ clever ways. It constantly redirects your attention away from your own darkness, so that you're continually obsessed with the evil "out there." Whenever it can plausibly claim to have found some, it concocts a plot to make you _reinforce_ it under the guise of good, so that you never suspect what you're actually doing.

When we mock our political opponents and they just double down on their idiocy, we may act dismayed, but part of us secretly _wanted_ it. That's because the more obviously-evil they become, the more justified we will be when we are one day forced to "take the kid gloves off" and _really_ show them our teeth. For nothing feels quite as good as violently dismantling Evil. We will never notice all the tiny things we cumulatively did to push them into a position where such violence would become necessary. If someone gently points this out to us, we will just scoff and write them off as stupid or naive. Can't they see that we were "fighting evil"? What were _they_ doing?

And if they point it out _contemptuously_, we will perceive them as evil themselves. Think about how you feel when someone stands in contemptuous judgement of you. Whether they have a valid point or not, you can sense that they don't have your best interest at heart. In fact, they don't have _anyone's_ best interest at heart — except, perhaps, their own. They are doing to you exactly the thing I'm warning about above. They _want_ to get a rise out of you, because your recalcitrance will prove to them that they have indeed located one of the secret hiding places of evil, and thus are licensed to extinguish it by any means necessary. You, in turn, are likely to give them exactly what they want, because you feel precisely the same way about them.

What you can't see in that moment is that the Darkness is playing a horrific game through both of you. We're all familiar with the idea that the elites are playing regular people off each other to take attention away from themselves, but the rabbit hole goes _so much deeper._ There is a kind of parasite that has infected **all** of our minds, and it is playing all of humanity off itself to create a world of pure darkness. It presently seems to be winning that fight, in a positive feedback loop: the more we mindlessly play its game of "see evil, smash evil," the more evil we create.

Your true enemy isn't actually other people, but this astonishing virus that has captured all of our minds. The real fight against evil only begins once you see clearly how it operates.

The way it works is astonishingly simple. Think about what's "wrong with the world," and bring to mind the people responsible. Notice the feelings of malice, contempt, or self-righteousness that arise. Notice how it feels convincingly like this is your inner goodness responding. It's not. It is your darkness masquerading as your goodness. If you listen to it, you _will_ behave in some way that creates more darkness in the world, even as you are flawlessly convinced that you're helping. It is precisely this same illusion that has given rise to every atrocity that humans have ever perpetuated, even if the outer details differ considerably.

Those sentiments — malice, contempt, and self-righteousness — exist for _only_ one purpose: to blind you to what your subconscious is secretly doing. In fact, such blindness is the only way that anyone is ever able to (knowingly) cause harm. Part of them knows _perfectly well_ that they're doing wrong, but this knowledge is very carefully shielded from conscious self-reflection. Think about the political opponent example. Part of you knows that your cruelty will just create more enmity in the world, but you somehow can't get yourself to admit it in the moment. Something almost identical is happening in the minds of "evil people" to permit them to do what they do. They know _perfectly well,_ but that knowledge is cleverly hidden from the part of them that would put an end to it.

When you fight them or try to force them to confront their misbehavior _with contempt_, you're not actually trying to help. You are simply under the sway of the same illusion that they are. _Your_ darkness is secretly helping theirs hide itself from the tiny part of them that knows better; a part that they've (consciously) forgotten even exists. If you actually want to help, the "trick" is to _see_ that they are under the command of this mind-virus and don't ultimately want to be doing its bidding (the key word being _ultimately_). It's not enough to simply _believe_ this, or else you may end up just being _nice_ (which can be dangerous). You must actually gain direct insight into how the virus has ensnared their mind. This is the only way to evict it instead of empowering it. This is true kindness, and it is **not** about being nice.

Entire volumes could be written on how to gain such complete insight, and we don't have room for that here. But it all begins by realizing that all the evil that you hate "out there" exists in latent form "in here" — and that you are only capable of fighting it to the degree that you're not falling into its oldest trick yourself. A good litmus test is to ask yourself how easily you fall into malice, contempt, or self-righteousness when confronted with evil or injustice. Equivalently, check whether you see evil as _intrinsic_ to your enemies' minds. These are all unmistakable signs that the darkness is secretly operating in you, undetected. Until you see this clearly, you cannot help but unwittingly spread it.

Make no mistake: it is _extremely painful_ to discover that you yourself have been spreading evil — and that part of you always knew it perfectly well, even as you were doing it. This discovery knocks the sanctimonious wind right out of you, as you're brought to your knees with the horrifying realization that you're every bit as fallible as the people you've been contemptuously judging. Alas, this realization often only lasts a short while until you get right back on your high horse. This is something I know all too well.

Kindness and compassion (which we'll use interchangeably) may be the most misunderstood words in the English language. They don't mean being nice, or sweet, or tolerant, or understanding. The reason we _believe_ they mean these things is that part of our mind is trying to wriggle out of being kind even when deep down we know it's the right thing to do — and it is _always_ the right thing to do.

You see, there is an aspect within every one of us that is willing to harm the world for our own benefit. This is an extremely painful thing to admit — especially if we fancy ourselves "good people" — and so we avoid confronting it. 

[//]: # (This is what gives rise to the psychological tendency known as the _fundamental attribution error_ — briefly, that we judge ourselves by our intentions but others by their actions.)

We don't mock our political opponents to help them (or anyone else) "see the light," or to make the world a better place (like our conscious minds tell us). We do it to further distance ourselves from them; to remind ourselves of how much "better" we are. Part of us knows perfectly well that this will make them worse people — and not only are we okay with this; we're secretly trying to _create_ that outcome.

[//]: # (Our subconscious keeps this a secret even from ourselves — which is why you may not believe me when I tell you.)

It's not that mocking and shaming are intrinsically bad. They can probably be helpful in the right circumstances. But if there's even a trace of malice, contempt, or self-righteousness behind them, your subconscious is lying to you about its true motivation. It isn't actually _trying_ to help the world or other people in that moment. It's trying to prove you right; that your target really _is_ as horrible as you perceive them to be. And this strongly-held intention will encourage them to _become_ the villain that you need them to be to uphold your worldview and self-image.

What you can't see in that blinded state is that minds are infinitely flexible — including the ones you've written off. Deep down — perhaps beneath their conscious thresholds — they know this about themselves, too. They can feel you attempting to erase this knowledge; to convince them that they're irredeemable. This makes you appear _evil_ to them, which triggers their natural reflex to _fight evil_. This somehow doesn't alert you to the possibility that you might be doing something wrong, like it should. On the contrary, it serves as conclusive proof that _they_ are evil, licensing you to escalate. This is how your subconscious creates new evil in the world while enabling you to feel righteous about it.

All evil is ultimately enabled by a similar smokescreen. There is a mechanism in our minds that hides our misbehavior from ourselves. It's surely true that some people's misbehavior is much worse than our own, but the basic pattern is the same. Part of their mind is carefully hiding the knowledge of the _wrongness_ of their actions from conscious self-reflection. It is a self-deception that we all share. You have a sacred responsibility to help them undo it. And it begins with seeing that self-righteous judgement isn't actually an attempt to do that, even though it very convincingly feels that way.

Notice how it feels like some people know _perfectly well_ what they're doing and choose to do it anyway; thus they really _are_ irredeemable, and deserve only contempt. Here's the problem: you can know something _perfectly well_ and simultaneously hide it from consciousness. For example, you know "perfectly well" that mocking your political opponents makes the world a worse place, but you still can't get yourself to admit it when it counts. Until you see how brilliantly your own subconscious hides your own misbehavior from you, you will never understand the fiendish mechanism that enables "bad people" to do what they do — and thus never discover the secret key that undoes it.

What is this "secret key"? The fact that all minds are redeemable isn't just a belief; it is something that you can learn to perceive directly. In fact, part of you already perceives it. There is an astonishing sense in which you are everyone and everything, and deep down you've always known it. I know this sounds like a vague and woo-woo mystical fantasy, but it really is true. It is why acts of great kindness inspire you so powerfully, even when you gain no obvious personal benefit from them. Whatever benefits the Whole benefits you, because _you are the Whole_. You long most deeply to remember this.

The more thoroughly you remember this, the more you realize that forsaking anyone else is forsaking yourself. Some part of you doesn't yet feel worthy of remembering the full truth, and so it finds secret ways to intensify conflict in your world, and then blames it on the world, to keep the truth hidden. **This is in no way your fault.** More self-blame will not help. Only healing the inner conflict will. This is a gift that you can then offer others.

Kindness is any behavior that induces this remembrance in "others" — or really, in the Whole. It isn't always gentle or nice. Sometimes compassion must be fierce, or perhaps even violent. It may even require what appears to be mockery or shaming on the surface. But _under_ the surface, part of you always knows the difference — and your "target" does, too. They may still consciously perceive you as an enemy, but part of them slowly begins to remember what is really happening.

All the darkness in the world is connected, and part of it lives within your very own mind. Every time you feel the urge to externalize it, you're being given an opportunity to heal the part of it that you (and only you) have complete responsibility for. Don't turn away from that opportunity. It is the "secret key" that unlocks your potential to be of genuine service to the Whole. The worst possible place you can end up is fully externalizing evil, so that it exists only "out there" in loci that you perceive yourself to be valiantly defeating. This is the ultimate self-deception, masquerading as powerful "spiritual truth."

How would you behave if you knew that you are everyone, and everyone is you? All the victims, all the perpetrators — everyone. How would you treat "others" upon realizing this? In particular, how would you treat the _difficult_ people, the _bad_ people, the _evil_ people?

You would recognize the part of yourself that lives within them, and vice versa. You could not possibly feel any contempt, or malice, or animosity. Don't get me wrong: you would still oppose them — possibly fiercely or even violently — but you would be free of the illusion that your contemptuous judgement or self-righteous outrage was in any way benefiting the world.

You would see clearly that these sentiments exist **only** to push people _further_ from the truth; _away_ from recognition of our (surprising) commonality. **We hate "bad people" not to help them (or anyone else) see the Light, but to shove them further into the abyss**. We do this to make them _worse_ people, so that we can feel better by comparison; to continue pretending that we're fundamentally separate and superior. But there's one small problem.

This makes the world worse for our own (supposed) benefit, and part of us knows it. To avoid consciously confronting this horrifying fact, we hide it from ourselves, convincing ourselves that we are just "fighting evil." But now we're in an even bigger mess: not only are we darkening the world, we are lying to ourselves about it. Far from helping us distance ourselves from the "bad people," this subconsciously reminds us of our deep similarity — which we are now forced to hide even harder, resulting in a horrifying feedback loop from which it is _extremely_ difficult to escape.

This is the trap that (nearly) the whole world is caught in. We are all so busy hating the "bad people" out there that we don't realize what is going on in here; what we ourselves are contributing to the madness. In fact, that is _why_ we are doing it: to avoid confronting the darkness within.

Contempt **always** makes the world darker. This is a difficult thing to admit, but necessary. The mechanism that allows us to hide this truth from ourselves is _precisely_ the same one that allows the "bad people" to do what _they_ do without remorse. And the more we engage in this self-deception, the more we encourage them to do the same. It is inevitable. This is **exactly** the wrong thing to do if you want to see a more beautiful world, which you — _we_ — ultimately do.

Your enemy is not truly other people, but the darkness that has ensnared all of our minds. I don't mean this in an abstract sense. You can actually learn to perceive this "dark entity," communicating with itself beneath our conscious thresholds. The "evil" in other people's minds is reaching out to the latent evil within yours, encouraging you to mindlessly obey it in the name of "good." It is a kind of secret handshake, which we often unconsciously accept. It is the oldest trick in the book, and it somehow continues to fool us to this day.

People sometimes fear that there is an "evil conspiracy" behind all the world's ills, secretly pulling the strings. They are not crazy: they are sensing something authentic, and this is it. There _is_ a kind of evil conspiracy, and every last one of us is in on it. Every act of unkindness toward _anybody_ empowers it — and a deep part of us knows this. Being _kind_ doesn't mean being _nice._ It just means being awake to this trap.

Until we have seen the brilliant ruse by which the darkness seduces our own minds, it is impossible to understand what is going on in the minds of the "bad people" — and thus to do anything genuinely useful about it. That is why everything comes down to deeply knowing yourself. If there is any self-righteousness or contempt left, it is an unmistakable sign that your mind is still hiding something _big_ from you. Please find out what it is.

Your Light is capable of accomplishing everything you think you need your darkness for — and so much more. The world does not need more of our contempt. It needs our fierce, uncompromising Love — whatever form it must take. Let's help each other — _ourselves_ — remember this.

What if it were really true that you are literally everyone? All the victims, all the perpetrators — everyone. What would it be like to come back from discovering that?

The more deeply you saw it, the less able you would be to hate anyone. You would see that even the _worst_ person is only suffering from a kind of amnesia — and that hating them can only ever _deepen_ it. In fact, hatred is itself a manifestation of that very same amnesia.

Hating the "bad people" feels unmistakably righteous, but this is exactly the illusion that must be penetrated to understand how they are able to do what they do in the first place. They are under a kind of spell that makes their misbehavior feel okay — and our hatred is designed to make us behave in a way that makes them feel _more_ justified.

In other words, our malice does not _accidentally_ make the world a darker place; it is explicitly _designed_ to do that. There is a kind of parasite that lives in our minds, tricking us into pushing each other further into the dark while convincing us that it's _good_. When we cannot see the light in others, we feel impossibly _righteous_ for hating them — when in actuality this is the surest sign of our parasite controlling us.

We really don't want to be doing this — and the more you remember that you don't, the more your very way of being begins to remind "others" that they don't, either.

What if I told you that all the darkness in the world is connected — and that part of it lives deep within your own mind?

This might be the hardest thing for humans to accept, but it's the truth. There is unkindness deep within each of us that we hide from consciousness, and by letting it fester, we increase the chances of heartbreaking events occurring _somewhere_ on the planet — events that we then wring our hands at, not recognizing our own profound connection to them.

We don't recognize our own darkness because it always feels perfectly justified — or even _righteous_. The mechanism that is hiding yours from you is **exactly** the same one that prevents the "bad people" from consciously confronting the wrongness of _their_ behaviors. This mechanism exists within all of us, and it actively shields us from the full implications of our words and actions.

That's why it may not be obvious that being cruel to "bad people" — whoever you think they are — is itself a form of evil. This isn't a moral judgement, but something that you can learn to directly perceive. Such behavior increases the "net darkness" in the world. I can't tell you how it's possible to perceive such a thing, but it is.

It doesn't even require overt cruelty: simply by harboring contempt, malice, etc., you are lowering the bar for darkness to manifest itself somewhere. And the most horrifying discovery is that this isn't an accident. We don't hate bad people to make the world better, like our conscious minds tell us: we do it to distance ourselves from them by pushing them _further_ into the dark. This creates new evil, and a deep part of us knows this. We can't admit it to ourselves for exactly the same reason that they can't face what they are doing.

When we hide this fact from ourselves — by pretending that our animosity is _righteous_ — we are subconsciously inviting those around us to do the same. Whether they are "allies" or "enemies," their minds are made darker as a result. 
This causes a ripple effect out into the world, eventually causing horrors to materialize _somewhere_; often in a location distant enough in space and time that you will never consciously register their existence, let alone your connection to them. In fact, they are likely to induce _more_ outrage in you, causing you to pile on even *more* animosity. This is the vicious cycle that we see unfolding across the planet today.

When this is all made conscious, confronting evil feels entirely different. You see that our true enemy isn't actually other people, but the darkness that has ensnared all of our minds. You then behave in ways that help others become conscious of their shadows — whether that requires being _nice_ or _fierce_ (or possibly even violent). Either way, it is true kindness. It is completely absent of contempt, malice, and self-righteousness — and this makes all the difference.

It is not something you can fake or calculate your way to. If you are trying to *force* others to see it, there is almost certainly an element of contempt (and thus your own shadow) still operating. Nor is it binary. Rather, the more you clean up your own darkness, the more your very way of being begins to expose others to theirs.

This is the only path toward the "more beautiful world" your heart most deeply longs for — and it all begins with you.

There's something inside us that loves to obsess over the faults of others — in particular, how _bad_ they are, and how if only they'd change, the world would be so much better. But one "big reveal" that both psychedelics and meditation offer is that this obsession is _always_ a cover for something going on inside of _us_, even though it so convincingly seems to be about others.

It's not that we're entirely _wrong_ about them, per se (though often we are). It's that the _contempt_ and _malice_ we feel are always in proportion to how much "inner work" we still have left to do. As we heal the darkness within, something astonishing happens: we increasingly discover that the "bad" we see in others is invisible to them in exactly the same way that ours was to us — and that our contempt existed only to make it _harder_ for them to notice and heal it.

The truth is that we are all hypocrites — especially those of us who are sure we're not. Part of what this means is that our minds hide certain unpleasant things about ourselves from ourselves. One of the most effective ways to do this is to keep our attention fixated outwards, on the flaws of others — and then to treat them in ways that _appear_ to be helpful, but are secretly designed to push them further into the abyss, so that we look better by comparison.

As this tendency subsides, 

The reason that _kindness_ is such a hard concept to define is that it's simply the _absence_ of this kind of self-deception.

By adulthood, most of us have realized that "hurt people hurt people" — and thus that kindness is sometimes the right approach when dealing with bad behavior. Such kindness doesn't have to be sweet and gentle — it can be fierce (or perhaps even violent) while still being firmly rooted in a fundamentally benevolent intent. It may be "tough love," but it is still love — not necessarily directed at the person specifically, but at the world as a whole, of which they are a part.

On the other hand, sometimes misbehavior seemingly cannot be explained by any kind of pain or "great battle." The person seems _fundamentally bad_. In such cases, compassion evaporates and is replaced by contempt or malice. We may still tell ourselves that it's for the "greater good," but the heartfelt benevolence is gone. Something much darker has taken its place.

It is easy to convince ourselves that these two are the same; that "tough love" and malicious harm can both be for the greater good.

A secret part of you knows perfectly well that treating _anyone_ with contempt just pushes them further into the dark — and it _enjoys doing so_. But given your self-image as a "good person," it can't do this to just anybody. That would reveal its presence to you. So it keeps a lookout for people who it can convince you _have_ no "inner light," so that contempt becomes the only option.

It is exactly the same mechanism that is responsible for their misbehavior in the first place. The details may differ, but its function is essentially the same: to make some (or even all) people appear deserving of contempt, so that certain self-serving tendencies may manifest.

Please know that I am not accusing you of anything. In fact, it is only by becoming aware of and then _deeply forgiving_ this part of yourself that you will understand _why_ it is misbehaving — at which point it will not only stop, but it will help you perceive the "great battles" in others that you previously could not see. Situations will shift from the "contempt" category into the "tough love" category, and your arsenal of tough love will grow.

There's a mechanism within our minds that actively blinds us to the far-ranging implications of our words and behaviors.

Consider a power- and money-hungry politician. He may start a war, which he will justify with noble-sounding motives. Whatever good comes of the war (if any), it will create a lot of needless suffering in the service of enriching him.

Does he _know_ this? Yes and no. Part of him knows _perfectly well_, but his mind is able to shield that knowledge behind an impenetrable wall of justifications. This is self-deception. We all know what this is like. Maybe not on that scale, but we have all overridden our conscience before. Part of us _definitely knows_ — but it's very hard to get us to look that knowledge in the eye.

When we watch a slimy politician in this state, we tend to feel contempt. And that contempt feels righteous; like it's there to help us fight his evil. But something much more interesting and insidious is actually going on.

Part of you knows that you have a tremendous capacity for self-deception. You subconsciously see something of yourself in his eyes. So your mind does something very clever: it treats him with cruelty.

When you are in a state of self-deception, and someone tries to point it out in a nasty way, what happens? You see them as a bad person — because you subconsciously know that they can only do this from a place of self-deception. It inspires you to be nasty in return. It justifies and reinforces your self-deception.

When we see that slimy politician, we tend to feel contempt. And that contempt feels righteous; like it's there to help us fight his evil. But something much more interesting and insidious is actually going on.

Your mind knows that by treating him with contempt, he will see _you_ as someone worthy of contempt, which will convince him that what he is doing is righteous after all. And that recalcitrance will in turn convince you that what you are doing is righteous. Hopefully you see where this is going.

Something within us enjoys fighting with the "bad people" and generally watching them be harmed or humiliated. Pause and see if that's true. We think this is a sign of the good within us, but it's actually a sign of something much darker.

We know that this behavior will make them worse. We may tell ourselves that it won't, or that it's their fault if it does, or that the benefits outweigh the drawbacks, but deep down we know that these are just lame excuses for malicious behavior. And it isn't just a side effect of otherwise-noble behavior: something in us _wants_ them to get worse, because the worse they get, the more vindicated we feel, and the more licensed we are to escalate our righteous wrath.

This idea may be threatening or offensive to our egos, but if we introspect deeply enough, we will find some truth in it.

We behave this way to reinforce our self-image as "good people," but there's a slight problem: deep down, we know that genuinely good people don't shove others further into the dark while calling it righteous. So not only are we acting from self-deception, but this knowledge forces us to suppress our awareness of it even harder, resulting in more powerful self-deception. We quickly become completely unable to consciously acknowledge that this is what we're really doing.

But this isn't something to feel guilty about. That just drives it further out of consciousness. It's actually caused by a kind of mind-virus; one that we all harbor. It's what the Buddhists know as the ego, and it's also commonly depicted as a devil on your shoulder. But what that image gets wrong is that the devil is actually extrinsic to your mind, while the angel represents your deepest nature.

Your devil's job is to make certain people appear _fundamentally defective_ and therefore subhuman, so that harming them becomes not just okay, but positively righteous. This is the trick that enables genocides, but it is operating in every one of us. (Ironically, the people most likely to slide down the path toward atrocities are those who are most convinced that they couldn't — for their devil has already bypassed their mind's most important safety checks. These are also the people who display the most contempt for "bad people.")

Your devil knows that "bad people" are only able to misbehave because they're under the sway of _their_ devil, but it hides this fact from you. It makes you perceive their evil as _intrinsic_, so that you'll viciously attack the person instead of their parasite. It knows that this will just drive the person further into its dark clutches, and it _wants_ this. Although you and they may be enemies on the surface, your devils are secretly _allied._

(It is worth pausing to appreciate how clever this is. When you enter the space of self-deception — which happens whenever you feel contempt — others can subconsciously sense this. This makes them perceive _you_ as "bad" for precisely the same reason that you see _them_ that way. They then feel compelled to attack you and/or justified in mistreating you. So all that is required to create evil is to _feel contempt_ — and it is easy to convince yourself that you haven't done anything wrong.)

Any time you hate someone, your devils are exchanging a kind of "secret handshake." In fact, they're not really separate. If you look carefully, you'll see that they behave more like outgrowths of a single distributed malevolent entity; the _Devil_, if you will. This sinister entity continually communicates with itself beneath our conscious thresholds, tricking us into empowering it while flawlessly convinced that we're fighting it.

It is the primordial "evil conspiracy"; the one to which all the rest ultimately filter up. Every time we feel malice, contempt, or even self-righteousness toward _anyone_ for _any reason_, we are secretly feeding the Beast. Every act of unkindness ripples through its terrible body, lowering the threshold for more acts of evil to erupt in distant locations — for which we will feel absolutely no complicity. But part of us always knows.

It is the perfect trap: a network of evil to which everyone contributes but for which nobody accepts responsibility. It is why the US is headed toward civil war while nobody recognizes their own part. It's not that we're all equally complicit. We're certainly not. But we're lying to ourselves if we believe that our contempt for the people most responsible is actually helping.

So then what are we supposed to do? After all, the only thing required for evil to thrive is for the good to do nothing. On the other hand, the only thing worse than letting evil win is secretly joining forces with it. I can't give a complete solution, but here's a start.

We must each become deeply aware of this darkness within. Otherwise, _every single thing_ we do to "fight" evil secretly just strengthens it, despite our conviction that we're helping. This rabbit hole goes deep — and the deeper we go, the more we perceive something curious: nobody _else_ wants to be infected by their parasite either, despite (what appears to be) compelling evidence to the contrary. Even those who _say_ they enjoy cruelty — the ones we classically think of as "evil" — are suffering from a kind of Stockholm Syndrome.

The more free we become of our parasite, the more we begin to perceive the "great battles" that are tricking other people into protecting theirs — even when they're not aware of these battles themselves. There is always an aspect of people's minds that doesn't want to be under its sway. This isn't just a belief; it is something you begin to _perceive._

Seeing this clearly enables us to behave in ways that help people evict their parasites — the only thing that genuinely removes evil from the world. (We may think that straight-up murdering evil people does too — but when it is done maliciously, it amplifies the darkness in others' minds, resulting in a net gain. Don't ask me how this works, but it is something you can learn to see. There is no "free lunch" here. We cannot bypass the hard inner work.)

[//]: # (Smothering their light. Extremely difficult to confront the full extent of our complicity. Inner Light. We also project badness when there is none.)

Such behavior is _compassion_ or _kindness_, and it doesn't mean being nice. Sometimes it must be fierce or even violent. But it comes from a completely different aspect of mind, and your "target" can sense this difference, even if only subconsciously. Their devil cannot find the slightest "hook" in your mind by which to justify itself, and so it is weakened, even if only imperceptibly. If you feel even a trace of self-righteousness — no matter how well hidden — you are giving it this hook.

In fact, if you even perceive the other person as "other," then there is still work left to be done. This is the hardest part to talk about. Reality is actually one seamless interconnected whole, and our separation is only apparent. This truth isn't unveiled fully until _enlightenment_, but we can all sense it to one degree or another at all times. The less a person senses this, the more "evil" they appear — and our cruelty is an attempt to make them sense it less. It is _exactly_ the wrong thing to do.

To be clear, compassion does not always tell you what the most helpful behavior _is_. That requires wisdom, which is a separate but related skill. Compassion just ensures that you are acting in accordance with your deepest values; that you are not falling victim to your self-deception. Before it is firmly in place, our strategies to defeat evil are actually no such thing. They always secretly contain an element meant to elevate or enrich us at the world's expense, unbeknownst to us.

Our true enemy is not actually other people. It is the powerful darkness that has captivated all of our minds. We each have a role to play in dispelling it, and it begins with ourselves. When we cannot see the Light in others — or worse, when we are convinced that it does not exist — this means we still have work to do. This is what we must remember if humanity is to survive.

What if nearly everything you're doing to "fight evil" is actually strengthening it — and moreover, what if part of you already knows this but is actively concealing it from your conscious mind?

There's an insidious mechanism in the minds of the "bad people" that shields them from confronting the full implications of their misbehavior. It's not that they _don't_ know that what they're doing is wrong. A deep part of them knows perfectly well — and yet the _wrongness_ is very cleverly hidden from conscious self-reflection. They both _know_ and yet somehow _don't._ This is the secret mechanism behind all evil. It's hard to describe, but we all know this state quite well.

It's the same thing that's happening when you feel contempt for those very people — or, indeed, perceive them as (fundamentally) bad in the first place. This sentiment feels totally righteous; like it's there to help you _fight_ their evil. But this is a sinister lie. Contempt (for people) exists **only** to shield you from what your subconscious is secretly doing: preparing to justify behaviors that will elevate or otherwise enrich you at the world's expense — and make you feel _good_ about it.

I cannot convince you of this, for precisely the same reason that you cannot force the "bad people" to confront what they are doing: the more aggressively you try, the harder their mind will shield it from them — and thus the more "evil" they will appear to you. Now for the kicker: _this isn't by accident._ It's not just an unfortunate side-effect of your otherwise noble intentions, like your mind tries to make you believe. _It's secretly the whole point._

Something in us delights in shoving the "bad people" further into the abyss, but it cannot make this too obvious, so it comes up with a fiendish plan. It alters our very perception, so that we don't see a fellow human in the grip of a terrible mechanism that we ourselves share — indeed, that is controlling our minds _at this very moment_. No, we see someone who is _fundamentally defective_; totally unlike us. They therefore cannot be helped; they must be punished.

This part of you knows that by simply harboring this malevolent intention, you will appear to _them_ as fundamentally defective — because their subconscious recognizes that you're in the grip of self-deception. Far from seeing you as someone with the moral authority to be judging them, they will perceive you as someone who needs to be put in your place; someone for whom harm is justified. You will in turn take this as proof of their defectiveness, closing the loop on the sinister plot.

Before we continue, let's pause to appreciate the elegant beauty of this ploy. You didn't have to do anything overtly evil. All that was required was to _harbor a dark intention_. That's what contempt *is*. This is something that is easy to lie to yourself about, and even easier to hide from others — at least, consciously. But we are all subconsciously sensitive to it, which is what allows it to work.

But we're only scratching the surface of the true depths of the horror.

This is all enabled by a kind of mind-virus. The Buddhists know it as the _ego_, and it's also commonly depicted as the devil on your shoulder. It is the thing in you that needs you to be _special_; to elevate yourself above the world somehow. In some people, it manifests as a desire for wealth; in others, the need to look and feel like a "good person."

However it manifests, it will achieve its aim in one way or another — even if it requires stomping on others. For the "bad people," this is straightforward: it just needs to convince them that harming people is okay. For the "good people," it is a bit trickier. We know that cruelty is generally wrong, so we need to be clever about it. We thus divide the world into (fundamentally) good and bad people; those who deserve our compassion and those who do not. The latter are worthy of harm.

Despite our differences, there is one thing all of our devils have in common: whenever we obey their seductive voices, we induce others to do the same. The "greedy banker" _invites_ our contempt; we accept this invitation by nastily judging them for it, which just convinces them that the idiots they're harming deserve it, which convinces us that... etc. They get to have more wealth, and we get to feel more self-righteous. Win-win.

Our devils are _always_ subconsciously coordinating like this. In fact, they're not really independent. From a certain perspective, they behave more like outgrowths of a single malevolent distributed entity: the _Devil_, if you will. **This is the hardest thing to describe, but the most important thing for humanity to become aware of.** We are all harboring a piece of our true nemesis, and protecting it to the death.

This "dark entity" continually drives humanity toward various kinds of Armageddon: situations in which everyone is violently defeating the evil "others." It is why the US is headed toward civil war without anyone suspecting their own complicity, and explains bitter [divorces](https://www.gottman.com/blog/this-one-thing-is-the-biggest-predictor-of-divorce/) in which each side feels like the exclusive victim / hero. Nearly the whole world is caught in its terrible sway, evil provoking "righteous" retribution at every turn, without anyone ever noticing the true source of it all.

You know how people sometimes suspect that there's an "evil global conspiracy" lurking in the shadows, secretly running the show behind the scenes? They are not crazy. _This_ is what they are subconsciously sensing. 

To be clear: there are certainly groups of especially-infected people who conspire to cause great harm, but even they are ultimately subordinate to the _primordial_ conspiracy; one that we are _all_ secretly members of. Every time we feel malice, contempt, or even self-righteousness toward _anyone_; every single time we are unkind, we are strengthening the Beast; reinforcing the conditions that effectively _compel_ the existence of our enemies. And the craziest thing is that _part of us already knows this._

It is impossible to overstate the shock of discovering, for the first time, that you have _always_ been in on the "evil global conspiracy." It is terrifying, heartbreaking, and humbling all at once. We realize all at once what utter hypocrites we are; that we have no leg to stand on if we're still contemptuously judging others.

I keep using the word "subconscious" to describe this behavior, but that's not quite accurate. **It is completely accessible to consciousness, if you know how to look.**

[//]: # (If we suddenly became consciously aware that we've been creating more evil, we would go insane from the shock of discovering our hypocrisy.  )

There is a self-deception mechanism in our minds that actively prevents us from consciously acknowledging the full implications of our words and behaviors. When you perceive someone as "bad," this is what you are recognizing in them. Part of them knows perfectly well when what they are doing is wrong, but the "wrongness" is carefully hidden from conscious self-reflection.

If you then feel contempt for them, then it is your _own_ self-deception that you are experiencing. That sentiment exists only to shield you from discovering what your subconscious is secretly doing: preparing to justify some behavior that will elevate or otherwise enrich you at the world's expense — and make you feel _righteous_ about it. It is exactly what you blame others for.

The way this works is fiendishly clever. When you feel contempt for your enemies, they can subconsciously perceive the self-deception operating in you, even though you consciously cannot. This makes you appear "bad" to them for _precisely_ the same reason they do to you. So now they feel even _more_ justified in their behavior, which in turn makes you feel more justified in yours.

This isn't an accident. Our self-deception is enabled by a kind of parasite in the mind, classically depicted as a devil on our shoulder. It knows how other people's devils behave, because theirs are fundamentally identical. Yours _knew_ how theirs would respond to contempt, and it wanted this, because it _strengthens_ theirs. Your devils are not enemies: they are _allies_. They _planned_ this.

In fact, from a certain perspective, our devils behave more like limbs of a single distributed malevolent entity: _the Devil_, if you will. Its behavior is too clever for words, but I have to try.

You know how people sometimes suspect that there's an "evil global conspiracy" lurking in the shadows, running the show behind the scenes? They are not crazy. They are subconsciously sensing something genuine: there is indeed an aspect of all of our minds communicating with itself beneath our conscious thresholds, shielding itself from discovery in _insanely_ clever ways. 

This "dark entity" continually drives humanity toward various kinds of Armageddon: situations in which everyone is violently proving just how good they are. It is why the US is headed toward civil war without anyone suspecting their own complicity, and explains bitter [divorces](https://www.gottman.com/blog/this-one-thing-is-the-biggest-predictor-of-divorce/) in which each side feels like the exclusive victim / hero. Nearly the whole world is caught in its terrible sway, evil provoking "righteous" retribution at every turn, without anyone ever noticing the true source of it all.

Its greatest trick is to prevent us from suspecting, let alone detecting, our own role in keeping it alive. We only ever see the aspects of it that live "out there," which we then feel compelled to violently attack — but this just makes it stronger. We never notice that it is the aspect "in here" that initiated this perception and behavior in the first place. We are tilting at windmills. Any time we feel contempt, malice, or even self-righteousness toward _anybody,_ we are just feeding the Beast.

It's not that we're _not_ supposed to fight the evil out there. But to the degree that we are not yet free of our own self-deception, we are only capable of strengthening it in others. We pat ourselves on the back for "fighting evil" and then lament the increasingly sorry state of the world — which we then must "unfortunately" fight even harder. We never suspect that something within us _wants_ this.

It is what the Buddhists know as the "ego" — the part of us that needs to feel special. For some people this may be about accumulating wealth, and in others it is about being "good people." It makes us perceive other people in whatever way necessary to justify behavior that will bolster our self-image. For "good people," our subconscious is on the prowl for anyone we can plausibly see as "bad," so that we can make them _worse_ — via behaviors that appear righteous on the surface.

To be clear: there are surely groups of particularly "endarkened" people who consciously conspire to cause great harm, and **we must hold such people accountable** — but when we do so with contempt, we are secretly (and on a subconscious level, _knowingly_) reinforcing the very conditions that effectively compel their existence. All such "conspiracies" ultimately filter up to the primordial conspiracy that we ourselves are members of. They cannot be defeated without our seeing this.

This is not just a wacky theory or

If you manage to take your own egoic mechanism offline for even a moment, it feels exactly like you'd imagine feeling if you were suddenly freed from a demonic possession. You clearly perceive how this "demon" has very cleverly commandeered people's minds.

Seeing this all clearly turns your whole world upside-down. We are hating people for their susceptibility to the world's most fiendish mind-virus — the one responsible for our very hatred. And this hatred exists for no other reason than to push them further _into_ its evil clutches.

(To be fair, there does seem to be a tiny percentage of people who have consciously welcomed the demon in, for whom the description "evil" really does capture something important. Such people pose a unique challenge. Being "kind" to them in the conventional sense can indeed be dangerous. And yet the very _deepest_ aspect of their mind does not want it. Again, it is only once you see exactly what "it" is that you understand why _nobody_ ultimately could. Think of it like a form of Stockholm syndrome. If you want to defeat evil, you must want them to be free of it, too.)

What lies beneath the ego is something like a boundless love for all of reality. You see that you aren't really fundamentally separate from it. Any harm you cause to the world is ultimately done to yourself. The recognition of this "absolute good" within is what slowly brings the process of self-deception to an end.

This "absolute good" is something that we cannot take any credit for. Instead, we can only feel profound gratitude for whatever grace allowed us to discover it, and heartbreak that it still remains so deeply hidden in others. The hardest part is watching the whole world being casually cruel to each other, unaware of which "team" they are secretly fighting for. It inspires a fierce determination to end the "possession" that has captured people's minds, instead of deepening it like we've unwittingly been doing. We clearly see the face of our true nemesis for the first time.

This doesn't mean that you will suddenly become nice or lovey-dovey toward evildoers. You may still need to be fierce, or perhaps even violent[^dalai-lama-gun]. Mockery, shaming, or even _apparent_ contempt might still be useful tools in your arsenal. But these will be in the service of _freeing_ people from the darkness, not pushing them further in. It is a kind of "tough love," and feels _nothing_ like the self-righteous antagonism that we normally feel when "fighting evil." You are still "connected to your heart." **That is what is most crucial.** Others can sense the profoundly benevolent intent (even if only subconsciously), and it makes _all the difference in the world_.

---

In every interaction you have two options: to either encourage the Light in others, or to fight their darkness with yours. Again: **encouraging their Light has nothing to do with being _nice_**. It is about being completely unwilling to abandon your own Light under _any circumstances_ — including the one that their darkness is presently testing you with. Their darkness is looking for a "hook" in your mind that it can use to justify itself — some sign that even you, the "good person," are weak to its seduction. If you refuse to abandon your integrity even then, the fierceness of your Light subjugates their darkness. They subconsciously remember that _the Light_ isn't just a myth.

This is authentic kindness (aka compassion). It is "radical" for two reasons. First, it contradicts our usual intuition that some people "deserve" it while others don't. It could never be the case that some people deserve to be shoved further into the abyss while others deserve to be freed from it. Second, it need not look anything like "kindness" in the conventional sense (though most often, it will). It certainly doesn't have to be soft or weak.

I know it feels like some people don't _have_ an inner Light to encourage, but this is just an illusion that our darkness uses to get its foot in the door. By the time it has tricked us into dividing the world into fundamentally "good" and "bad" people — which feels like the most natural thing in the world — it has already infected the deepest aspect of our minds. Then, it can bide its time fostering conditions that will get us to commit unspeakable horror in the name of "good."[^genocide]

> Be kind, ...

There are two ways to understand this aphorism. The first goes something like this: 

> Be _nice_, because _most_ people are fighting a great battle. Some people, however, are just bad. They're _willfully_ misbehaving, and not due to any 'great battle.' They don't deserve kindness.

The second understanding is much more profound.

Imagine a mind-virus that could infect your mind so deeply that it appeared to _be_ you. This way, other people would never detect that you were fighting a battle at all. They would perceive you as someone worthy only of contempt; someone to hate, which would just drive the virus _deeper_. Meanwhile, your "true self" would be crying out for help from inside a tiny box, locked away so deeply that the bulk of your mind couldn't even remember that it existed.

This story is not far from the truth. This virus exists, and we call the infected people "evil."

If you think I'm suggesting that we be _nice_ to them, think again. The virus is far too clever to be defeated by such a naive strategy. But being cruel is even worse — and the reason why is even more shocking: _we ourselves are infected._ Our contempt for other people is only ever initiated by our virus, and its only purpose is to _strengthen_ theirs. **Our viruses are secretly coordinating.** We are all pawns in a game that most of us don't even realize we're playing.

Our infection may not be as deep as the "bad" people's — yet. We still retain some semblance of our "true selves"; the part that could never want to cause harm. But the virus is operating within us at all times, always subtly manipulating our perceptions, biding its time so that it can burrow deeper.

True kindness isn't about being nice. It's about recognizing this fiendish foe that we all face, and doing what we can to help each other defeat it — instead of being tricked into empowering it like we have been.

Let's win this fight. It's the only one that ultimately matters.

"Compassion" may be the most deeply misunderstood word in the English language. We think it has something to do with being gentle or nice. Compassion for evildoers seems naive and even dangerous — what good could come from empathizing with someone so despicable?

But the truth is that part of your mind _already_ empathizes with them, in a certain sense. From their perspective, what they're doing makes total sense. When you rediscover the aspect of your mind that sees this, all contemptuous judgement ceases, and something radically different takes its place.

There is an aspect of every person's mind that only wants the best for others and the world. This can be very hard to believe. It may even sound like a naive religious belief. But there is a way that you can see it for yourself. How?

First, you must find the part of _your own mind_ that only wants the best for the world. You may think that this is already obvious; that it is your normal state, but there's a simple way to tell if this is true. Are you able to feel contempt for _anyone_? How about the [...]

If you answered "yes," you probably believe that the contempt is there to _help_ the world in some way. This is a vicious lie. That's not something I can convince you of, but it is _also_ something that you can confirm for yourself.

The truth is that contempt exists _only_ to elevate or otherwise enrich yourself at the world's expense. You don't hate people to make the world better; you do it to make yourself feel superior. If you could inspect your subconscious while you are feeling this way, you would discover

Any time you feel contempt for _anyone_ for _any reason_, your subconscious is secretly plotting to elevate or otherwise enrich yourself at the world's expense — to harm the world and profit from it.

Your hatred of the "bad people" isn't there to help you fight evil; it's there to help you push them _further_ into the dark while feeling righteous about it. Whatever you do to "own" them — no matter how respectable you try to make it seem — _will_ make the world a darker place, even as you gloat about it.

This is _insanely difficult_ to admit to oneself, for obvious reasons — but it is not until you see precisely _why_ it is so difficult to admit (and begin to undo it) that you begin to consciously appreciate what makes it so hard for the "bad people" to realize what _they_ are doing.

I say "consciously" because your subconscious already knows it. It knows that if you were them, you would behave (more or less) exactly as they do. From their perspective, what they are doing makes total sense — and it is possible to _enter_ their perspective while still being you. When this happens, you wish for only one thing: to undo the bizarre contortions of mind that have resulted in them thinking that this is okay.

This isn't a condescending perspective, nor one that tolerates (let alone condones) misbehavior. But it is also not one in which contempt or malice are remotely possible. If you were a neurosurgeon, would you hate or judge people for the tumor you're removing from their brains? It's not a perfect analogy, but captures something of the taste.

There is a deep part of people that doesn't want to be doing wrong, but this is impossible to see or appreciate until you find the part of yourself that could never, ever feel contempt for anyone. In every interaction with people (in fact, in every action whatsoever), you are either helping people out of the abyss or shoving them further into it. If you want to end the "bad" in the world, you must help people remember that _they_ want to pull others out — and you cannot do this until you yourself remember how to pull _them_ out.

There are so many people in the world for whom it is natural to feel contempt — the hypocrites; the downright evil; the aggressively stupid; the willfully ignorant — and there seem to be more by the day. We probably know that we're not "supposed" to feel contempt, but that seems like an unreasonable and increasingly outmoded religious idea. How _else_ are we supposed to deal with such despicable people?

The truth is that we don't actually feel contempt to help anyone or anything: that's just a story we tell ourselves to maintain our self-image. We do it for a much less noble reason; one that will take a minute to unpack.

If you could actually see other people's minds in their full complexity, you would discover that the very deepest aspect of them doesn't — indeed _couldn't_ — want to be any of the aforementioned things. Certainly _some_ part of them does — and that's the part we imagine we're directing our contempt at. But what happens is that their defense mechanisms just kick in and intercept our attack, causing them to dig in their heels. We then get to feel contempt for this incorrigibility, too.

What we can't see — or admit — is that our behavior was subconsciously _designed_ to trigger those very defense mechanisms _so that_ we could feel licensed to escalate our disdain. We _want_ "bad people" to get worse, so that we can continue to gloat over them. It doesn't matter how "bad" someone is, or in what sense they are "bad": contempt is _only ever_ designed to trigger this reaction for the sake of our egos.

With training, it is actually possible to see — and communicate with — the part of people that doesn't want to be deplorable; the very deepest aspect of their minds. This is called _compassion,_ and it is profoundly misunderstood. It doesn't mean being _nice._ Such "communication" may _look_ like contempt — or even violence — from the outside, but feels nothing like it from the inside. The recipient can sense the profoundly benevolent intent (even if only subconsciously), and it makes _all the difference in the world._ This may not be immediately evident — and it doesn't provide us with the satisfying hit of self-righteousness that actual contempt does — but it is of genuine benefit.



---
---

Do it to hide our similarity.

It is why our faith in humanity is restored when we witness acts of kindness, and why we sometimes thank others for being generous with strangers even when no (apparent) benefit comes to us. It is why certain literature speaks to us so deeply, despite making very little _rational_ sense.

[^child]: Not that there will be familial love, or indeed "love" in the conventional sense of the word.

Pause and reflect on what's wrong with the world, and bring to mind the people responsible — the "bad people." Don't they know that they're being evil — and if they don't, then _shouldn't_ they? Either way, they seem fundamentally morally defective and thus deserving of contempt.

Now think back to a time when you skirted your conscience, either by pretending you couldn't hear it or that it was safe to ignore it. We've all done this. Try to recall what it was like. Part of you _knew_ you were doing wrong, but the _wrongness_ was carefully hidden from conscious self-reflection. It is a kind of self-deception — and it is precisely the same mechanism that enables the "bad people" to do what _they_ do. Theirs may be much more extreme, but it works on the same principle.

It turns out that _contempt_ can only be generated from within this state. Why?

The reason that "bad people" need to rely on self-deception is that some part of them _doesn't want to be doing wrong._ This means that they are not "fundamentally" morally defective. They are far more like us than we are willing to admit.

Something in your mind is actively shielding you from seeing this. It does this by making you feel contempt — a toxic emotion that you would otherwise never feel. That in turn causes you to act in ways that provoke your target into doing things that justify your contempt, thus licensing more righteous wrath — the most delicious feeling of all.

When you do this, others can tell — even if only subconsciously, and even if you cannot — that you are acting maliciously, and not for the benefit of the world. This appears evil to them for precisely the same reason that they do to you. They know that you are trying to push them further into the dark and calling this "righteous." They thus perceive you as someone lacking the moral authority to be scornfully judging anyone, and feel the urge to put you in _your_ place.

Part of you _knew_ this would happen, and _wanted_ it, because it "proves" that you were right about them. After all, any decent person would have simply repented in the face of such noble fury.

Contempt is a self-reinforcing delusion whose only purpose is to prevent you from discovering our shared humanity, by encouraging others not to. It is a way to keep people trapped in darkness while feeling good about it. It is _evil._ Full stop.

This can be incredibly difficult to admit to ourselves, but it's also necessary. If we don't see this, it means that we're still immersed in self-deception — and in this state, we cannot _reduce_ the self-deception of others; we can only amplify it. In other words, we can only inspire more evil, despite what we may consciously tell ourselves.

Perhaps MLK said it best:

> *Darkness cannot drive out darkness; only light can do that. Hate cannot drive out hate; only love can do that.*

Evil is not actually a _presence_ (like it seems), but an _absence_. The absence of what? Of the perception of the profound interconnectedness of all life. This absence cannot be "extinguished"; it can only be dispelled through illumination. This may sound like spiritual mumbo-jumbo, but part of you knows exactly what I mean. Everything comes down to remembering this. The more you do, the more you remember how to banish evil.

This is called _compassion_ (or what MLK called "love") — but it doesn't mean being _nice_ or lovey-dovey. Sometimes it must be fierce, or perhaps even violent, as we will later see.

---

Although evil is an absence, there _is_ a terrifying way in which it behaves like a presence.



---
---


This feeling is a lie. Part of you knows that you are not "fundamentally" better than anyone. Contempt exists only to maintain this lie: it causes you to provoke them into behaving in ways that _prove_ their "badness," thus licensing even more contempt. That is its _only_ purpose.

This behavior makes the world darker — something a "good person" isn't supposed to do. So your subconscious hides this fact from you, making you perceive your behavior as _righteous._ Any increased darkness can be blamed entirely on them. This is a form of self-deception.

It turns out that self-deception is also how the "bad people" are able to do what _they_ do without remorse. They know perfectly well when what they are doing is wrong, but the _wrongness_ is cleverly hidden from conscious self-reflection.

This wouldn't be necessary unless _some_ part of them didn't want to be doing it. Consciously, you may not believe this, but subconsciously, you can perceive it. But now you're in an even bigger pickle: your attempt to prove how different you were just proves how similar you are.

---
---

Something deep within us knows that there's no _intrinsic_ difference between us and them; that we ourselves are capable of almost anything under the right circumstances. Our subconscious uses contempt to help this fact stay hidden from consciousness. It does its job well, which is why you may not believe me when I say that you already know this.

To take an everyday example: consider what happens when we mock our political opponents. Don't they just dig in their heels, see _us_ as evil, and vow to fight harder? We tell ourselves that we had "good intentions" (to shut them up; force them to introspect; convince others not to join them, etc.), but the truth is that something in us is _trying_ to maintain the polarization.

This ultimately harms the world, and part of us knows it. But "good people" don't do such things, and so we must hide this fact from consciousness. But wait a minute: what if the "bad people" are doing exactly the same thing? What if they're hiding _their_ misbehavior from conscious self-reflection, too — which would only be necessary if there's some part of them that doesn't want to be doing it, which means that... oh, sh*t, maybe our cruelty isn't so noble after all. Maybe we're just shoving that part of them further into the abyss. That would be _evil._

It's not that they don't know that what they're doing is wrong. The worst people will even openly _admit_ that it is, and that they enjoy it. But even then, this knowledge must remain cleverly hidden 

I'm not speaking hypothetically. If you look carefully enough at your mind while feeling contempt — and this is _hard_ — you will find that part of you can actually perceive this about people, and is searching for clever ways to gleefully push them further into the dark and then hiding this from yourself, just to bolster your own self-image. Not to put too fine a point on it, but this is _evil_ — and this is true _regardless_ of how bad they are or what they've done.

But you don't do this because you're a "bad person": that very notion is the problem. You do this because of a strange quirk of human psychology — one that is best described in mythopoetic terms.




---

But just pause and reflect on how much more viscerally satisfying it is to watch a bad person "get owned" than to have a change of heart. The latter would rob us of the unspeakably gratifying pleasure of seeing evil get "destroyed."

Our contempt naturally leads to malice, which is a very effective way to help "bad people" stay bad. Even if there is a tiny part of them that wishes to be free of their darkness — a possibility that we flatly refuse to countenance — we ensure that it stays suppressed. In the same way that witnessing acts of kindness can restore your faith in humanity, your malicious intent is (secretly) designed to produce the opposite effect in your target and all others who witness it. Your "allies" will subconsciously reframe this as a "necessary evil," and thus noble.

Keeping people trapped in the dark is hardly the mark of a "good person," and so this drive must remain subconscious.


---
---

Why is it so hard to eradicate evil? Could it be that something within us is secretly fighting to keep it alive?

That might sound absurd to you, or even offensive. Yet it is the truth — and without seeing this clearly, we have no hope of winning the fight.

---

When you think about the "bad people" of the world — whoever they are — it's hard not to feel at least a little contempt. But this emotion isn't merely counterproductive: it's a sign of something much darker.

If you look carefully enough into your mind while you are feeling contempt, you will discover that something in you is secretly plotting a way to create _more hostility_ in the world. Of course, it will not tell you this: instead, you will feel like you are doing something _righteous._

To take a simple example, consider what happens when we mock our political opponents. Don't they just dig in their heels, see _us_ as evil, and vow to fight harder? We tell ourselves that we had "good intentions" (to shut them up; force them to introspect; convince others not to join them, etc.), but the truth is that something in us _wants_ more polarization, because it allows us to feel self-righteous — as delicious a feeling as they come.

As a more extreme example, didn't the architects of the "War on Terror" _know_ that indiscriminately bombing the sh*t out of people would just inspire a new wave of "terrorists" who they would then "unfortunately" have to destroy too? The answer is both yes and no: a part of them certainly knew, but they were only able to justify it to themselves by shielding the immense _wrongness_ from conscious self-reflection; from the part of them that would put an end to it if forced to confront it.

We can see this in their eyes when they speak: they are clearly lying through their teeth when they pretend they did it for noble reasons. But if this inspires contempt in you, then what you're not seeing is that _your eyes are taking on precisely the same look!_

It is completely inevitable: any time you feel contempt, your mind is secretly trying to increase the enmity in the world while finding a way to convince you that it is good — and it _will_ find a way.

When you think about the "bad people," you probably can't help but feel intrinsically superior to them. They seem _fundamentally morally defective_, quite unlike you.

Yet there is a sense in which you are _not_ fundamentally different (which we will get to soon), and there is a part of you that _knows_ this. It knows that your self-righteousness is ultimately baseless. But it also knows that you don't want to see this, and so to hide it from you, it does something very clever: it provokes more evil in them, to reassure you of how different they are.

How? It's really clever: simply by feeling self-righteous, you appear like a "bad person" to them. Think about it: if someone self-righteously puts you in your place (whether you deserve it or not), do they appear _noble_ to you? Of course not. They look like pompous jerks who need to be put in _their_ place. Contempt looks slightly evil — whether it comes from a "good person" or a "bad person" — and people tend to respond to it as such.

We may try to hide our contempt, but part of us is actually making sure they feel it. When this is met with a predictably unhealthy response, we tell ourselves that we're simply exposing evil that was already there. We refuse to recognize our role in _provoking_ it; something we are astonishingly good at, though we probably don't realize it.

As I said, part of us _does_ realize it, but that part is hiding this fact from our consciousness. Why? Because if we knew we were provoking evil, it would destroy our self-image as "good people." This is a form of self-deception, which turns out to be precisely the mechanism that enables the "bad people" to do what _they_ do. Part of them knows perfectly well that they're doing wrong, but that knowledge is carefully shielded from conscious self-reflection.

If you really want to stop them, you have to force them to own up to their self-deception. Yet if you try to use "force," you will only end up looking self-righteous, because that is how you _feel_.

The solution is simple (though far from easy): you must discover the full extent of your own self-deception, starting with your hidden desire to provoke evil in others. The more you see this, the more clear it becomes that you're not _fundamentally_ unlike them. This is not something I can describe to you unless you've already seen it. But the more you do, the less possible it is to feel contempt.

The more completely you have done so,

Why is it so hard to eradicate evil? Could it be that something within us is secretly fighting to keep it alive?

That might sound absurd to you, or even offensive. Yet it is the truth — and without seeing this clearly, we have no hope of winning the fight.

---

Let's start with an obvious example: why do we enjoy mocking our political opponents? The first thing to acknowledge is that we _do_ enjoy it. We can come up with numerous reasons why it's helpful (it shuts them up; it forces them to introspect; it convinces others not to join them, etc.), but there's a much darker reason for our enjoyment.

Part of us knows that it will lead to increased polarization, and we _want_ this. Why? Because there is something uniquely gratifying about violently defeating evil — and the more clearly we highlight theirs, the exponentially more satisfying it will be when we finally extinguish it once and for all. We need their evil to be unmistakable so that we can feel completely righteous about the profound violence that we intend to visit upon it.

Part of us believes that we are merely honing in on the evil that is already there, but another part of us knows that we are also _provoking_ it. We may believe that such provocation wouldn't work if they had any decency, and so the fact that it _does_ is proof that they are intrinsically bad — but we don't realize just how outrageously clever we are at pushing people's buttons. Something in us _needs_ people to be fundamentally broken, and will stop at nothing to "prove" it.

We may be aware of this dark tendency in ourselves, and evey try to avoid it, but it goes far deeper than we realize. And mockery is far from the only tool that we use: any time we perceive someone as _fundamentally morally defective_ — evil, in short — _something_ about our behavior will be secretly designed to provoke it, whether we are conscious of this or not. It is completely inevitable. It might be as subtle as stoking outrage in others, to lay the groundwork for future action.

So what's the solution then? To just let evil win? No. The trick is to understand how it works.

We've all had the experience of skirting our conscience, either by pretending that we couldn't hear it, or that we could safely ignore it. Try to remember what that state is like. It is a kind of self-deception. This is the secret mechanism behind _all the evil there ever was._ People know perfectly well when they're doing something wrong, but the _wrongness_ is carefully shielded from conscious self-reflection. 

Their subconscious shielding is so clever that it convinces us (and often even them) that _no_ part of them knows — which could only mean that they are, indeed, fundamentally defective. Thus begins our righteous assault.

Here's the thing: as we saw, our attack is surreptitiously designed to provoke more evil. If you inspect your mind carefully enough while this is happening — and this is hard — you'll discover a horrifying truth: that part of you _knows_ this is wrong, but you are carefully shielding this fact from yourself. In other words, you are being self-deceptive — and this will make _you_ appear evil in _their_ eyes. And this isn't by accident: it is precisely what enables your provocation to work. Of _course_ they are going to react poorly to what they perceive as evil! This was the secret plan all along!

This can be extremely hard to admit to ourselves, for obvious reasons. But until we do, we can never understand what drives other people's evil, and are thus incapable of healing it. 

Our behavior isn't nearly as bad as that of people who commit atrocities — and our self-deception is correspondingly much weaker. Yet despite this, we _still_ struggle to confront it. It is always painful to discover that we've been deceiving ourselves, and this is only _more_ true for the "bad people." That's what prevents them from confronting the full wrongness. We think that their misbehavior should be _more_ obvious to them, but we've got it exactly backward — and we are _motivated_ to.

If you want the "bad people" to confront their misbehavior — which is the only way to end it — you _must_ understand how their self-deception works. This is not an intellectual thing that you can get from a book. It requires seeing how it operates in your own mind. You will know you've succeeded when you stop seeing "evil people," and no longer feel even a trace of malice or self-righteousness toward anyone. These are unmistakable signs that it is still operating in you.

---

If you had instead perceived them not as "fundamentally defective" but as engaged in profound self-deception — which is the truth — then you would have behaved very differently. You might still have leveraged mockery (or perhaps even violence), but there would have been no trace of self-righteousness to it — and others can subconsciously detect this. It prevents their "evil" from finding the hook that it needs to justify itself.



There is obviously something very different about what we are doing and what the "evil people" are, but there is also something very much the same — and as long as we harbor that part of ourselves, we are always at risk of becoming them, whether like to admit this or not.

[^armageddon] We also know that this "Armageddon" that we are trying to provoke — the day when our Good violently prevails over their Evil — will not lead to lasting peace. It is just another form of escalation itself.


---
---

What if nearly everything you're doing to "fight evil" is actually strengthening it — and moreover, what if part of you already knows this, but is carefully hiding it from your conscious mind? What if the difficulty admitting this to yourself is caused by precisely the same mechanism that prevents the "bad people" from fully realizing what _they_ are doing?

These are provocative questions, but they point at an astonishing truth. The Devil hides in the very last place you would ever look.

---

Why is it so hard to eradicate evil? What if the tools we've been using to fight it are secretly weapons _of_ it?

Take a moment to think about what's "wrong with the world" and bring to mind the people responsible. Do this until you can really feel some animosity. They obviously know that what they're doing is wrong, and deserve to be punished for it.

We all know that we're not "supposed" to hate people (even bad ones), and that it's "right" to show them compassion. But these admonishments have little impact on us until we see exactly _why._ There's something truly astonishing to see here.

When you feel animosity, your mind is secretly gearing up to harm the world in some way that you won't consciously recognize as harmful. A simple example is when we mock our political opponents. We may describe it as "fighting evil," but part of us knows that we're only doing it to provoke them into behavior that will justify even more mockery — or worse.

It's not that mockery has no place in the fight against evil. Sometimes it may indeed be a helpful tool. But when we wield it with animosity, we're not actually _trying_ to help anyone — certainly not them, but not even the world. We're just justifying our vengeful instincts by dressing them up as righteous. This may be a hard pill to swallow, but it's crucial that we see this clearly.

There is a bizarre state that our minds occupy, in which we hide our true intentions from even ourselves. We know perfectly well that what we're doing is wrong, but that _wrongness_ is carefully hidden from conscious self-reflection. This is precisely the state that the "bad people" are in, and until we see clearly how it operates in ourselves, we have no hope of defeating the evil "out there."

This state is caused by a kind of mind-virus, and an especially clever one. It makes us do its bidding without ever realizing that we are infected. One of its greatest tricks is to make us search for other "infectees" and then behave in ways that will _deepen_ their infection: we find the "bad people" and then provoke them into becoming _worse._ The way this works is fascinating.

By activating our malice, it makes us appear evil to them (and to everyone else, whether they are consciously aware of it or not. Our "allies" are mostly not, for obvious reasons). This serves as a signal to _their_ viruses that we too are infected. The parasites then perform a kind of "secret handshake," in which they agree to empower each other while convincing their hosts that they are fighting.

Think back to the "mocking your political opponents" example. Consciously, you feel like enemies, but if you introspect carefully enough, you'll find that your darkness is secretly _allied_ with theirs. Your parasites have a common goal: to increase the animosity in the world, while convincing you that this is _righteous_ and _necessary_. Evil never actually _fights_ evil; it is always on the same team.

If you zoom out, you wil discover that _all_ of our parasites are secretly allied in this way. In fact, if you are perceptive enough, you will notice that they behave more like outgrowths of a single malevolent "distributed organism" that is manipulating _all_ of our minds. This isn't some abstract theory: as best I can tell, everyone who pays careful enough attention eventually discovers this.

Every time you feel hatred, malice, contempt, or even just self-righteousness, you are secretly feeding the Beast. It is completely inevitable. If you think you've found an exception — some uniquely evil person who _requires_ your malice — it just means that you are being manipulated especially hard. Alas, I won't be able to talk you out of it any more than you can simply talk them out of _their_ infection.

Even before you feel malice, there is an easy way to detect your infection. If you perceive the world as being comprised by "good people" and "bad people," the parasite has already accomplished most of its work. There is no actually dividing line; there are only those of us who are presently more and less infected. 

---


This doesn't mean we're "bad people." In fact, the very root of the problem is dividing the world into "good people" and "bad people"; those who deserve our compassion and those who deserve our animosity. That division exists for only one purpose: to provide you with people who it feels _right_ to mistreat.

In the same way that we dress up certain misbehavior as "righteous," the "bad people" do too. It is a kind of self-deception, and everything comes down to seeing how it works. 


---

People are only able to misbehave while under the sway of a particular mind-virus. People who are frequently under its sway we call "bad people," and those who are most deeply infected we call "evil people."

You are infected by this virus, too. It's mostly dormant, but it gets triggered when you encounter "bad people." It makes you want to be cruel to them — even if it's just light cruelty, such as mocking.

You may think that there's nothing wrong with mocking bad people, but that's the whole point: while under the sway of the virus, you never feel like you are. Misbehavior somehow just feels... _right._ That's why the "bad people" are able to do what they do.

Part of you knows perfectly well that you don't mock your enemies to help them "see the light," but mostly to provoke them into behaving in ways that will justify more mockery... or worse. But it is _so hard_ to admit this to yourself while you're doing it. It feels so convincingly like you're "fighting evil."

While possessed by the virus, there is always a part of you that _knows_ — but that part gets smaller and smaller the worse the infection gets. Even in "evil people," there is a tiny part that knows — their "inner light," so to speak — but this part is very hard for them to access.

We cannot tell when we are under the sway of our virus, but other people can. In fact, we _want_ them to. Why? Because the same way that other infected people look "evil" to us, we look (slightly) evil to others while in its grip. That's what makes mocking our enemies so effective: they feel like they're being judged by a _bad person,_ which is something they won't tolerate. Who would?

If you look carefully, you will discover that the desire to be cruel to "evil people" is secretly a desire to push their "inner light" deeper into the abyss; to deepen their infection. This is _malevolent._ That doesn't make you a "bad person" — if I thought so, I'd just be making the same mistake. What's happening is that their virus is triggering yours, as if through resonance.

If you "listen" carefully, you can hear all of our viruses resonating together. It is like a background hum of evil. At any given moment, mine is ready to trigger yours, and vice versa. They only need the right conditions.


To be clear, it's not that mockery is always wrong. Sometimes it can be a helpful tool.

What is the best way to fight evil? The obvious answer is to find the "evil people" and defeat them, but there is a very good reason that this plan hasn't been working: it's actually not meant to.

Evil behaves like a parasite that infects people's minds and alters their very perception. It makes the "infectee" see certain other people as subhuman, and thus fair game for cruelty. They know perfectly well that this is wrong at _some_ level, but the parasite cleverly shields that "wrongness" from conscious self-reflection. It is a form of self-deception.

We are all familiar with this schism of mind. We've all had the experience of skirting our conscience, either by pretending that we couldn't hear it, or that we could get away with overriding it. It is a kind of self-deception, and it is precisely this mechanism that enables _all_ evil.

When the parasite infects someone who considers themselves a "good person" — like you or me — it does something especially clever: the "certain other people" who it makes look subhuman are the "bad people." Think about it: doesn't it feel positively _righteous_ to treat those people with cruelty? It may be hard to admit this to yourself, but part of you knows that this is a dangerous lie.

When we viciously attack a "bad person," part of them can sense that we are under the sway of exactly the same parasite that they are. Therefore, we have no moral authority by which to judge them. So, far from simply repenting, they now see _us_ as evil, and include us in their group of "people who deserve cruelty." We take this as confirmation that they, likewise, belong in _ours._

This plan _can't_ work to end evil, because it was designed by the parasite _not_ to work. On the contrary, it is specifically designed to _strengthen_ the grip of the parasite in all of our minds — and it is working astonishingly well. Somehow, after thousands of years, we haven't caught on to its trick.

So is the solution to _not_ fight "evil people"? Not exactly. The trick is to see that there _are_ no "evil people"; only people who are more and less infected by the parasite. Once you see this — really _see_, and not just _believe_ — you no longer feel like you are fighting _people_. You are only ever fighting the parasite that has infected _all_ of our minds.

Sometimes, fighting the parasite certainly takes the _form_ of fighting people. So then what's the difference? You never feel _malice_, the sinister pleasure of watching people be harmed. You're not gleefully shoving the "bad people" further into the dark, like you were when under the sway of your parasite. You feel no _self-righteousness_; the sense that you are fundamentally better than anyone else. You can now see clearly that you are not; that this idea has **always** been the parasite talking.

This is called _compassion,_ and other people can sense it. There is no particular form that it must take. It can be fierce or even violent if necessary. But your fundamental benevolence prevents their parasites from using your evil as justification to further infect their minds. This makes **all** the difference in the world. It is the only way to actually fight evil instead of unwittingly spreading it.

That is why the fight against evil _must_ begin with doing everything in your power to find and evict the parasite that has secretly commandeered your mind.

There is something uniquely pleasurable about violently punishing evil, so our subconscious does something very clever: it seeks out "evil people" and then makes us behave in ways that provoke them, so that we feel licensed to escalate our righteous wrath. Part of us would be disappointed if they were to instead "see the light" and repent — even though that would be far better for the world. It is more satisfying to watch them suffer.

The really clever part is _how_ we provoke them. The mere _intention_ to provoke evil is itself evil — and their subconscious can sense this. It makes them perceive _us_ as evil, which they then feel compelled to fight. But because we are convinced that we are behaving righteously, we take this as confirmation that they are indeed evil — precisely what we needed to license escalation.

Our subconscious secretly orchestrated this, but it hid the plan from our conscious minds. This is self-deception. As it turns out, this is precisely the mechanism behind _all_ forms of evil: people know perfectly well when what they are doing is wrong, but the _wrongness_ is carefully hidden from conscious self-reflection.

This behavior is caused by a kind of parasite that lives in our minds. It manipulates our very perception so that we literally _see_ some people as deserving of malice. For you, it is the "bad people" — those who are fundamentally morally defective. But the thing is, they're not _fundamentally_ defective; they're actually under the sway of the very same parasite.

Your parasite is tricking you into overlooking the parasite in others, so that you behave in ways that give _their_ parasite the ammo it needs to trick them into doing the same right back at us. Don't you see? Your parasite and theirs aren't enemies — they are _allies!_ **All** of our parasites are allied, getting us to behave in ways that strengthen each other's at every turn.

This is that secret "evil global conspiracy" that everyone fears exists — and part of it lives within your very own mind. While under its terrible sway, every single thing you do to "fight" evil out there only amplifies it.

Its greatest trick is to convince you that it does not live in your mind, but only "out there." Maybe you think that okay, fine, you have a _tiny_ role to play in the world's ills, but still, the evil people are the real problem. But the truth is, once you are totally free of your parasite, that illusion falls apart — because you now directly perceive their parasites.

We've all had the experience of doing something wrong while convincing ourselves that it's not. What we may not realize is that literally _all_ evil depends on this mechanism of self-deception.

We are motivated not to see this, because it allows us to see ourselves as fundamentally different from the "bad people." And that enables us to harm them without feeling bad about it.

Harming "bad people" gives us the righteous feeling of fighting evil — except that part of us knows that they're not fundamentally different, and that this behavior just makes their minds darker.

This would be painful to admit, but luckily for us, their minds becoming darker just makes us more sure that they are fundamentally bad, licensing us to escalate our violence instead of confronting what we're really doing.



---

It is hard to admit, but there is darkness within each of us. It is not _intrinsic_ to our minds, but is more like a parasite. It knows that we are unwilling to harm people unless we see them as less than human — which most of us know is wrong. So it uses a clever trick: it alters our perception so that we see the darkness as intrinsic to some people's minds. We call them "bad people" and see them as subhuman, so that harming them becomes not just okay, but positively righteous.

Consciously, we don't realize that we're being manipulated; it feels like we're expressing a natural and healthy instinct to violently attack evil — which we now mistakenly equate with attacking the _people_. But no matter how subdued our attack (e.g., mockery), our underlying malicious intent makes us appear evil to them for exactly the same reason that they appear evil to us.

This has the effect of driving their darkness deeper into their minds, making it appear even more surely intrinsic, which inspires even more righteous violence from us, in a downward spiral. We act dismayed by their recalcitrance, but our darkness actually orchestrated this descent. We may not be conscious of this, but our "victim" is certain that we are, again for the same reason that we are sure that _their_ evil is fully volitional.

Our darkness tricks us into behaving in ways that will convince others that ours is intrinsic, because it knows exactly how theirs operates and will respond — _because ours and theirs are identical_. In fact, they are not just identical, but are more like outgrowths of a single shared "shadowy presence" that continually manipulates all of our minds; the _Devil_, if you will.

This is not just a wacky religious idea: it seems that everyone who introspects carefully enough eventually perceives this "distributed malevolent entity" which has a kind of intelligence and volition of its own that, even if not _literally_ true, explain its seemingly-coordinated behavior far more accurately than if ours were independent.

It is the primordial "evil global conspiracy," and it lives in all of our minds. Every attempt to maliciously subdue it "out there" just strengthens it, because such behavior is only ever initiated by it, even though it makes us believe that it was initiated by us. Contempt is its most insidious tool precisely because it appears to be the most unmistakably righteous.

There may well be groups of particularly darkened people who conspire to cause great harm, but their existence wouldn't be possible if the rest of us weren't feeding the source — and conversely, it is _inevitable_ given that we are. **We must hold such people accountable**, but when we do this with contempt, we are injecting more evil into the world. It _will_ find a way to manifest somewhere, though we will disown all complicity for it.

The only way for humanity to defeat the Devil is to stop falling for its tricks. Any time you feel malice, hatred, contempt, or even self-righteousness toward another being; any time you see them as fundamentally defective or inferior; you are being manipulated, and this _will_ create more evil. As you begin to clear up this misperception in your own mind, you discover what is causing it in others'. Only then can you do anything genuinely useful about it.

The topic of what such "useful" behavior looks like is vast and is beyond our scope. Such behavior depends entirely on circumstances, and is impossible to reduce to principles, except for one: the more deeply it is rooted in compassion — i.e., free of the above misperception — the more beneficial it tends to be. Being _entirely_ free is enlightenment; perception of our fundamental unity. (Note that this profound unity is also what allows the Devil to exist.) Rest assured that compassionate action _can_ be outwardly violent.
