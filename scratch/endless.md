We've all heard that "hate cannot drive out hate," but is it really true? How about something a little milder, like contempt? Surely when it's aimed at _bad people_ it can make the world a better place?

The truth is that "bad people" know perfectly well when they're doing wrong, but that knowledge is very carefully shielded from conscious self-reflection. It is a kind of self-deception. If you look precisely enough into your own mind while feeling contempt, you will discover something astonishing: it is designed to _deepen_ their capacity for self-deception. Yet it will feel very convincingly like you are doing something righteous. In this way, contempt is _itself_ a profound form of self-deception — the mother of them all.

Viewing other people as _fundamentally inferior_ enables you to get away with something that you otherwise could not. It licenses you to behave in self-serving ways that you wouldn't be able to if you could perceive their full humanity. For some, this is about financial gain or the feeling of power, but very often it is (ironically) just to bolster our self-image as "good people."

The problem is that when you do this, other people know exactly what you're up to, because it's a variant of the thing that they are up to. They therefore won't tolerate contempt from the likes of you — regardless of any merit that your words may contain. Instead, you will reinforce the part of them that sees this world as a dark competition amongst self-serving hypocrites, making their selfish behavior feel even more justified. Unfortunately, _you_ do not know what you are up to, because that knowledge is being very carefully shielded from conscious self-reflection. You will therefore take their recalcitrance as proof that they really _are_ evil, thus licensing even more contempt. You will never notice your own complicity in this dark spiral.

Self-deception cannot drive out self-deception. It can only reinforce it. The deeper down this rabbit hole you go, the harder it gets to notice that you're lost, because the more cleverly your darkness hides it from you. Feeling contempt for people who are stuck in this way is secretly a desire to keep them trapped for your own benefit.

Your enemies are not actually fundamentally inferior to you; they are merely caught in a different version of the same trap that you are. If you do not see this, then every action you take "against" them will secretly be in service _to_ them — or more precisely, in service of the same dark goal that they may or may not realize they are fighting for: a darker world in which limitless contempt is justified; one in which none of us ever has to confront the unprocessed shadows of our own minds.

Darkness is an absence masquerading as a presence. The absence of what? Of a particular insight.

The ultimate truth is that you are everyone and everything. It is said that this is only fully revealed upon _enlightenment,_ but all of us can sense it at all times, if only subconsciously. 

---


You have _no idea_ how fiendishly clever our darkness is. It is that "evil global conspiracy" that some people fear exists: a covert entity responsible for all the world's ills, that hides itself so perfectly that nobody even suspects its existence, let alone that _they themselves are in on it_. They cannot even see it when it is clearly and explicitly pointed out. This is what we are all up against.

---

The only way out of this dark trap is _kindness_. It has nothing to do with being _nice._ The conflation of those two words is itself an artifact of our darkness.


---
---

Why are we unkind to people who we perceive as "bad"? The answer seems obvious: we do it to make the world a better place. But this is an insidious lie. It explains why we're not _nice_, but not why we're not _kind_. Nice is about being pleasant and agreeable, which are clearly unhelpful in some situations. But kindness is something much deeper. It is the right motivation in _every_ circumstance.

---

A healthy mind harbors no hostility under any circumstances. That's not because it is meek or even "tolerant" per se. It can be fierce or even violent in subduing evil. These can be kindness too. But it cannot feel even a _trace_ of malice, contempt, or self-righteousness, because it has seen something clearly.

It has seen that those sentiments are lies: they exist *only* to help us get away with something that we otherwise could not. We want to behave in some way that is self-serving, which we couldn't do if we could see the full humanity of the person we are attacking. So a dark aspect of our mind tricks us into perceiving them as somehow _fundamentally defective_. That way, we won't feel bad harming them. It might not even be obvious what we're getting out of it. For some, it is financial gain or feelings of power, but very often it is (ironically) just to bolster our self-image as "good people," who therefore deserve to get away with more. A deep part of us recognizes our hypocrisy, but we carefully hide it away from conscious self-reflection.

We feel like we are teaching the other person a lesson, but they may not even be (knowingly) doing anything wrong. They may be honestly doing the best they can, in which case we're harming an innocent person. But even if they _are_ knowingly doing wrong, it's only because they're under the sway of _precisely_ the same self-deception that we presently are. Either way, the only "lesson" they learn is that this world is indeed a dark and phony place; that the Light is just a myth. Whatever temporary benefit we may achieve — such as suppressing their (public) misbehavior — this powerfully reinforces their self-deception, making them appear _more_ evil. This in turn proves to _us_ that the world is a nasty place, thus requiring our "righteous" escalation.

You have _no idea_ how good your subconscious is at telegraphing your darkness to others while simultaneously hiding it from yourself. This combination sets up perfect feedback loop, in which you can trigger others while convincing yourself that it's their fault. And this is far from the only way that your darkness leaks out. As long as you are harboring any hardness or hostility in your heart, it _will_ find its way into the world, one way or another, without your conscious knowledge. Except it's not truly unconscious: it is always available to consciousness, if only we choose to look. The problem is that we _choose not to look_.

Here is the choice that confronts each one of us: become aware of having chosen to look away — and thereby discover that this is how _all_ evil works, and that our self-righteous judgement therefore has no basis whatsoever — or continue to delude ourselves, entering deeper and deeper layers of self-deception, darkening the world in increasingly "justified" ways.

Evil is an absence masquerading as a presence. The absence of what? Of a particular insight.

The ultimate truth is that you are everyone and everything. It is said that this is only fully revealed upon _enlightenment,_ but all of us can sense it at all times, if only subconsciously. It is only by overlooking this astonishing truth that anyone is able to harm anyone else. This is self-deception; the origin of all contempt; the root of all evil.

Yet although it is an absence, it behaves very convincingly like a presence. When you look in the eyes of someone in the grip of this deception, you see the _presence_ of evil. This is the moment of truth. If you choose profound honesty, you will be forced to admit that the same potential exists within you, and you will gain at least some insight in how to evict it, commensurate with your willingness; your deep compassion.

Your darkness, on the other hand, convinces you that you could never be like them; that you are _fundamentally_ superior. You perceive them as _intrinsically defective_, thus inspiring contempt. Their darkness instantly recognizes that you have taken the bait, and the game is on. Now, both yours and theirs are secretly _allied_, knowing that they can freely spread darkness in the world, unbeknownst to you, their hosts.

In fact, from a certain perspective, your darkness and theirs aren't truly separate. They behave more like outgrowths of a single, distributed, malevolent entity. If your darkness is the devil on your shoulder, then this entity is the _Devil._ It is that "evil global conspiracy" that some people fear exists: a covert body responsible for all the world's ills, that hides itself so perfectly that nobody even suspects its existence, let alone that it lives _in their own minds_. They cannot even see it when it is clearly and explicitly pointed out. It is the _primordial_ evil conspiracy; the one to which all the rest ultimately filter up, and to which they owe their existence.

It continually drives humanity toward various kinds of Armageddon: situations in which everyone is violently proving how _righteous_ they are. It is why the US is headed toward civil war without anyone suspecting their own complicity, and explains bitter [divorces](https://www.gottman.com/blog/this-one-thing-is-the-biggest-predictor-of-divorce/) in which each side feels like the exclusive victim / hero. Nearly the whole world is caught in its terrible sway, evil provoking "righteous" retribution at every turn, without anyone ever noticing the true source of it all. Every act of unkindness you've ever perpetrated on anyone; all the hardness you carry in your heart; has only ever been in its service.

It is said that the elites are playing us off each other to take attention off of them, but the Devil is playing a _much_ bigger game — one in which even the elites are merely pawns. It tricks you into hating them specifically so that you will empower it — and thereby empower _them_. It is the reason that nothing ever seems to change. It accomplishes this by convincing you that your compassion isn't powerful enough to combat their evil; that your darkness is required. It is the ultimate trap — and we keep falling for it.

---

The Light is not just a myth; it is your most fundamental nature. Whereas your devil is extrinsic, your compassion is _intrinsic._ It is the very root of who and what you are. When you discover this in its entirety, you see it in everyone else, too — because, in a profound and astonishing sense, they _are_ you. It is your most sacred duty as a human to remember this, so that you can share it freely with others (though paradoxically, if you still see them as "other," and yourself as their noble savior, then this isn't quite it yet.)

Your compassion is not weak — indeed, it is the most powerful force there is. It is the _only_ thing that can genuinely combat evil, for precisely the same reason that light is the only thing that can combat darkness: the latter is nothing but the _absence_ of the former. Yet treating it like a presence can be skillful, because then you will not underestimate its terrifying capacity to grip minds and bring the whole world to its knees. This compassion must be paired with _wisdom,_ which is the knowledge of how best to put it into fierce and powerful practice. That takes time to develop, and is beyond the scope of this piece.

Our enemy is never truly other people, but the darkness that has overtaken all of our minds. May we all remember this, and free this world of the illusion that has overtaken it.

But this devil doesn't just whisper obviously-bad ideas in your ear; no, it alters your very perception so that other people's devils appear to be _intrinsic_. You therefore perceive them as subtly &#40;or profoundly&#41; subhuman, so that contempt becomes self-evidently righteous.)

[//]: # (This is the first crucial step in every atrocity ever committed. The Nazis referred to Jews as 'vermin,' and during the genocide in Rwanda, Tutsis were referred to as 'cockroaches' &#40;inyenzi&#41;. But please don't think I am making the silly mistake of claiming that hating Nazis makes you as bad as a Nazi. The point is to see that something in your mind is actively trying to find some way to make you feel _intrinsically superior_ to others — and that this is the "foot in the door" that opens your mind to going down a dark, dark path — one that you will not realize you've gone down until it is too late. You don't _need_ this crutch to fiercely combat Nazis.)

You never actually wanted to be malicious, but a bizarre "hall of mirrors" effect in your mind made the world appear in a way that seemed to require it. The "bad people" were merely trapped in a much more intricate version of the same. Seeing this clearly, how could you ever want to push them deeper in? Your sacred duty is — and always has been — is to help pull others _out_; to elicit their inner Light, instead of fruitlessly wrestling with their darkness, like two pigs in the mud. You see that this is a much more magnificent — and profoundly honest — vision of reality.)

Over time, we lose the ability to give people the benefit of the doubt. We stop seeing real people, and start pattern matching on their words, gestures, and general appearance. These patterns grow to match more and more people, enabling us to feel increasingly righteous even as the infection spreads. Soon even genuinely good faith efforts appear sinister. We think we're seeing their darkness when we're really seeing a reflection of our own.

This is how "the elites" are able to screw regular people without feeling remorse — and it is also how we secretly empower their misbehavior. We think that our contempt exists to fight them, but it is secretly designed to leak our darkness into the world, where it will ripple through minds, eventually finding its way back to theirs. Something in us _knows_ that it is doing this. In fact, it is doing it on purpose, to justify some feeling or behavior that we may not be conscious of yet. 

It would take a _profoundly_ wise person to help you confront this. If they did it gently, you could easily shrug them off. And if they did so with contempt, well, your mind is acutely sensitized to the game they're playing, and will violently return the favor.

This is _extremely hard_ to admit, but it must be done. If you — the "good person" — aren't able to confront your own self-deception, how much the less can you expect it of the "bad people"? 

[//]: # (The deeper down this rabbit hole we go, the less innocence we are able to see in others. More and more people appear "defective," until even their genuinely good faith appears sinister. Our mind is growing increasingly dark to support our "habit," yet we feel increasingly righteous, to cover our tracks.)
[//]: # (This is how our darkness masquerades as the Light. The more we fall for it, the less capable we are of noticing that we are, even when it is pointed out gently and kindly. Eventually people become frustrated and point it out with _contempt_. We know all too well what they're secretly up to — pretending to be helping while actually spreading darkness. Of course, we don't let them get away with it.)
[//]: # (People on opposite extremes of the political spectrum may disagree on the details, but they agree on one crucial thing: that _darkness is the way_. In this way, they are allies.)
[//]: # (This is how political ideologies overtake our humanity.)

This self-deception is caused by a kind of parasite in the mind. Think of it as that devil on our shoulders. It is _extrinsic_ to your mind. But unlike in the cartoons, it doesn't just whisper obviously-bad ideas in your ear; no, it alters your very perception so that other people's devils appear to be _intrinsic_. You therefore perceive them as subtly (or profoundly) subhuman — the first step in every atrocity ever perpetrated. Contempt becomes self-evidently righteous.

You and they may be enemies on the surface, but your devils are always _allied_; theirs triggering yours, which triggers theirs back, etc., resulting in an all-too-familiar descent into Hell. In fact, if you look carefully, you'll see that your devils aren't truly separate: they behave more like limbs of a single distributed malevolent entity — the _Devil_, if you will. It is that "evil global conspiracy" that some people fear exists: a covert entity responsible for all the world's ills, that hides itself so perfectly that nobody even suspects its existence, let alone that _they themselves are actively in on it_. They cannot even see it when it is clearly and explicitly pointed out. This is what we are up against. You have _no idea_ how clever it is.

It continually drives humanity toward various kinds of Armageddon: situations in which everyone is violently proving how _righteous_ they are. It is why the US is headed toward civil war without anyone suspecting their own complicity, and explains bitter [divorces](https://www.gottman.com/blog/this-one-thing-is-the-biggest-predictor-of-divorce/) in which each side feels like the exclusive victim / hero. Nearly the whole world is caught in its terrible sway, evil provoking "righteous" retribution at every turn, without anyone ever noticing the true source of it all. Every act of unkindness you've ever perpetrated on anyone; all the hardness you carry in your heart; has only ever been in its service.

It is said that the elites are playing us off each other to take attention off of them, but the Devil is playing a _much_ bigger game — one in which even the elites are merely pawns. Your hatred may help change the details of _who_ is in power, but not _what_ is in power. The only way to win is to stop playing its sordid game; to give up your "right" to harbor hostility. It isn't accomplishing what you most deeply want.

This has nothing to do with being nice, but _everything_ to do with being kind. Kindness is simply the absence self-deception. It can never be wrong. The more you are free of deception, the more you are able to recognize yourself in other people, no matter how "bad" they may be. You increasingly see the "great battles" that have led them down dark paths, which gives you insight into how to undo it instead of compounding it. Such behavior may look nothing like "kindness" from the outside — it can look fierce and violent; like mockery and shaming; like almost anything at all. But from the inside, you always know, for there is not even a *trace* of genuine malice, contempt, or self-righteousness. If you are still dividing the world into the fundamentally "good" and "bad," it is an unmistakable sign of self-deception operating.

The ultimate truth is that you _are_ everyone and everything. It is said that we only see this upon _enlightenment,_ but all of us can sense it to some degree at all times.

Contempt is intrinsically self-deceptive because it is the pretense that you are _fundamentally superior_ to your target. Then can sense that you're acting from self-deception, and part of them knows that this is what they are doing. They therefore feel that you do not have the moral authority to be judging them, which is why they dig in their heels. You, on the other hand, don't know that you're doing this, and so their recalcitrance just proves your point. It is the perfect trap. Contempt itself is not obviously-evil, especially when it's aimed at "bad people." But it reliably _induces_ evil — and anything that creates more evil can surely be called evil, especially when it pretends not to. So both you and your target walk away feeling increasingly justified.

People do not know that they're doing wrong — or more accurately, part of them knows _perfectly well_, but this knowledge (or its full implications) is very carefully shielded from conscious self-reflection. 



---

When we encounter darkness in the world, we feel morally licensed — obliged, even — to sprinkle in a little of our own. We are just giving them a taste of their own medicine or... something.

We then complain when the world as a whole looks darker later, not connecting the dots to our own behavior. 


---

Why are we unkind to people who we perceive as "bad"? The obvious answer is that we do it to make the world a better place, but this is an insidious lie. It explains why we're not _nice_, but not why we're not _kind_. Nice means pleasant and agreeable, which people sometimes don't deserve. Kind means something much deeper, and it cannot be earned.

When you look into the eyes of a "bad person," you probably see someone completely unlike yourself; someone _fundamentally morally defective_. This is a motivated misperception. All evil is ultimately just a form of self-deception: part of their mind knows _perfectly well_ that they are doing wrong, but that knowledge is cleverly shielded from conscious self-reflection. It is the same mechanism that has enabled our own misbehavior, if we're honest. Every one of us has skirted our conscience before, pretending either that we couldn't hear it or that we didn't have to listen. Our examples may differ in degree, but not in kind.

When you treat people with contempt, you _strengthen_ their capacity for self-deception. You are displaying a form of darkness yourself, and this triggers their defense mechanisms. They therefore appear even more evil, which convinces you that you were right about them all along. It is a self-fulfilling prophecy whose only purpose is to distance you further from your enemies.

[//]: # (Explain why contempt is a form of darkness. You are pretending to be intrinsically better. Can come later.)

Part of your mind knows perfectly well that you are creating more darkness, but it carefully hides this knowledge from conscious self-reflection. Sound familiar? You are doing to them precisely what you are viciously judging them for. In fact, this is what provokes their defenses in the first place: why would they tolerate contempt from a hypocrite?

It is worth lingering on this to appreciate its fiendish cleverness. Contempt itself doesn't seem obviously evil — but it secretly telegraphs a dark intent, which provokes _their_ darkness, and in this way  creates more evil. And anything that secretly creates evil can surely be called evil. Yet it provides you with the appearance that you are _fighting_ evil — and how could that ever be wrong?

This is how your darkness masquerades as Light; how it convinces you to do its bidding while making you feel utterly righteous. It is a kind of superpower: you are able to spread evil simply by intending it, and in a way that convincingly appears to be fighting it — except to those who have developed "the eyes to see." Our task is to develop these eyes.

Evil is ultimately an absence; the absence of a particular kind of introspective awareness. As such, it cannot be defeated by more absence. As MLK Jr sagely hinted:

> *Darkness cannot drive out darkness; only light can do that. Hate cannot drive out hate; only love can do that.*

But although it is an absence, it very convincingly _appears_ and _behaves_ like a terrifying presence. 

---

We can practically _see_ the evil in other people's eyes. It is what powerfully evokes our own darkness. 

---


If you were to suddenly be exposed to the full extent of your own complicity in the world's darkness, without the proper psychological safeguards, it would violently shatter your worldview. 

You intend to prove how _different_ you are, but it only proves how _similar_ you are. Your mind therefore pushes it even harder out of consciousness. It only takes a few cycles of this before we become incapable of seeing it, even when it's shown to us by wise people with considerable skill and patience. How much the less so when our noses are forcefully rubbed in it by those with "good intentions"; people who are hopelessly trapped themselves?

This is the terrible bind that humanity finds itself in now: everybody is busy trying to violently uproot the evil in others, not realizing the astonishing trick going on deep within their own minds.





[//]: # (You have the choice of treating such people either like they have the capacity for redemption or like they are fundamentally defective. The former is kind, and the latter is evil. Not just because it makes the world darker — which it does — but because it originates from an aspect of mind that is _trying_ to darken it.)




---
---

Humans have a nearly infinite capacity for self-deception. One of the clearest examples is when we pretend that we can make the world as a whole better by being unkind to individual people. The truth is that we are engaging in exactly the same self-deception that's driving their misbehavior in the first place.

"Kind" is not the same as nice. Nice means being pleasant and agreeable, and is obviously the wrong response in many situations. Kind means something much deeper. It is the right response to every situation. We will not get the more beautiful world our hearts desire until we see this clearly.

---

It is said that upon _enlightenment,_ you discover that you are literally everyone and everything. What would it be like to catch a glimpse of this realization?

You would see that evil is nothing but the _absence_ of this realization — and yet, despite it being an absence, it appears and behaves suspiciously like a _presence._

People are only able to cause (intentional) harm by objectifying others; seeing them as fundamentally subhuman or inferior. It is the cause of atrocities, and it is how corrupt politicians and CEOs justify harming others for their own benefit.

---


People are only ever able to misbehave due to self-deception: part of them knows _perfectly well_ when they are causing harm, but this knowledge is very cleverly shielded from conscious self-reflection; from the part of them that would put a stop to it if only it knew. This is the secret mechanism behind _all the evil there ever was_ — and it is also what enables our own misbehavior, if we're honest. Every one of us has skirted our conscience before, pretending either that we couldn't hear it or that we didn't have to listen.

When we see this mechanism operating in others, we don't recognize a fellow human in the grip of a powerful illusion that we ourselves share; no, we see someone who is _fundamentally morally defective_ and thus completely unlike us.

Take a moment to reflect on what's wrong with the world, and bring to mind the people responsible: the greedy bankers; the hypocritical CEOs; the corrupt politicians (and all who support them), perhaps. Don't they seem _intrinsically bad_; fundamentally unlike you? This is a motivated misperception, designed to enable you to treat them in ways that you otherwise never could. If you could see that they have the capacity for redemption, you would instantly realize that your contempt is profoundly counterproductive.

The truth is that part of you _can_ see it. If you look carefully enough — and this is _hard_ — you'll see that part of you is just choosing to overlook it. This is self-deception, and the surprising part is that your "target" can subconsciously sense it too. It makes them perceive you as a hypocrite — viciously judging them for something that you yourself are doing _right now_ — and it makes them feel _more_ justified in their misbehavior. You, in turn, take this as a sign that they really are as bad as you feared, thus licensing escalation. The world is made darker as a result.

It is worth reflecting on the fiendish cleverness of this trap. Simply by showing contempt, you were telegraphing your own darkness — as though to hint to them what you are really capable of if pushed. This provoked _their_ darkness, strengthening both in the process. In other words, all that is required to create more darkness in the world is to subtly reveal your own capacity to do so — and this in turn requires nothing more than pretending that you are fundamentally better than other people.

One way or another, your inner darkness _always_ finds a way to leak into the world, usually undetected by you. From there, it spreads to the far corners of the globe, affecting events far enough away in space and time that you can plausibly disown any connection to them. The problem is that _part of you always knows._

We can practically _see_ the evil in the eyes of "bad people," and it provokes our own inner darkness. The way this works is _fiendishly_ clever.  It is as though we have discovered

It makes us want to violently attack them — if not physically, then at least emotionally. This urge is secretly designed to darken the world; to keep the illusion of separation alive. The way this works is _fiendishly_ clever.

The deepest part of you knows that you are not intrinsically better than anyone. Although this is not made fully conscious until enlightenment, part of you can always sense it. Therefore, contempt — the pretense that you are fundamentally better than someone — is always delusion. It betrays your own lack of insight — in other words, it makes you appear slightly evil. This allows them to see you as a hypocrite, which their darkness seizes on as an excuse to justify its presence in their minds. You, in turn, take this evidence that they really are as bad as you feared, thus compelling you to escalate.

This dance was secretly orchestrated by the darkness in both of your minds. Theirs triggered yours, knowing fully well that you would return the favor. Even if you are not in direct communication with your target (say, a corrupt politician), your contempt darkens the minds of those around you — "allies," enemies, and bystanders alike. One way or another, the darkness _always_ finds a way to leak out.

This whole process is unconscious — except that's not quite true. The horrifying discovery is that it was always fully accessible to consciousness, if only you _chose to look_. But you chose not to look. And it is precisely this "choosing not to look" that enabled your enemies to do what they did — and what you were violently blaming them for.




---

You would suddenly discover that evil is not intrinsic to any mind; that people are only able to cause intentional harm because they haven't seen the truth yet; that even the most evil person is therefore ultimately redeemable. They are _you_, after all — just having been exposed to a vastly different set of conditions.

You would see that the reason we forsake people (i.e., treat them as irredeemable) is to sow more division in the world. It is why we treat our enemies with contempt. We choose to perceive them as _fundamentally defective_ to remind ourselves how different we are. We mock and shame them knowing fully well that they will just dig in their heels, which proves how bad they are, which justifies more contempt. The way this works is fiendishly clever.

Deep down you know that you are not intrinsically better than anyone. Although this is not seen fully until enlightenment, a part of us can always sense it. Therefore, contempt (for people, not just their beliefs or behaviors) is always delusional. It serves only one purpose: to dehumanize others so that we can treat them in a way that we otherwise could not. But for this to work, we must not be fully aware that we're doing it. It is this self-deception that has enabled all the worst atrocities in history, and it is also responsible for how we treat "bad people."

By feeling contempt, you are telegraphing to them your inner darkness. It is as though you are trying to subdue their evil by displaying a little bit of yours; by hinting at what you are capable of. But this backfires miserably: the darkness in their mind now recognizes yours as an _ally_. Both are after only one thing: _more darkness._ Their darkness tells them: "Look, this supposedly-good person is secretly a nasty hypocrite. We are justified in our behavior after all!" Yours tells you: "See, they really are as evil as we feared. We must escalate our righteous wrath." The darkness thereby becomes more firmly entrenched in both minds.

The darkness in all of our minds is intimately connected. In fact, it behaves more like a single distributed malevolent entity. If our darkness is exemplified by that devil on our shoulders, then this entity is the _Devil_. It is said that "the elites" are playing us off each other to take attention away from themselves, but the Devil is playing a _much bigger game_; one in which even the elites are merely pawns. It convinces you to hate them specifically so that you will feel licensed to behave in dark ways — ways that will ultimately circle back to them and make them feel even more justified in their misbehavior, thus reinforcing the cycle.

What are these "dark ways"? Reflect on a time when you've skirted your conscience, pretending either that you couldn't hear it or that you didn't have to. We've all done this. In that state, you know _perfectly well_ that what you're doing is wrong, but this knowledge is very cleverly shielded from conscious self-reflection. We convince ourselves that this is okay, especially given what all those "bad people" are doing. But this self-deception is precisely what enables the "bad people" to do what they do in the first place, and by engaging in it, we are _strengthening_ this capacity in them.

You know that "evil global conspiracy" that some people fear exists — the one that's somehow responsible for all the world's ills, yet which hides itself so perfectly that people never even suspect its existence? Well, _this is it_ — the _primordial_ evil conspiracy; the one to which all the rest ultimately owe their existence, and to which they all filter up. The reason we can't pin it down "out there" is because it lives deep within the shadows of all of our own minds. From in there, it knows _exactly_ what buttons to press to prevent us from ever suspecting our own involvement.

If we could see that the "bad people" had the capacity for decency, we would immediately recognize that contempt is not a skillful way to encourage it. 


We tell ourselves that they are _fundamentally morally defective_ so that we can blame them for their reaction to our contempt. Being _nice_ to an "evil person" is clearly not an option, and if we are fierce, then of course they will see us as nasty hypocrites and dig in their heels. But this isn't true: it wasn't your fierceness that provoked this response, it was your _self-deception_; your _contempt_.

We tell ourselves that they're not shielding anything; that because they are _fundamentally morally defective,_ there is no conscience to shield anything _from_. But the "big reveal" is that we only believe this so that we don't have to confront the fact that we are, in fact, empowering their self-deception — that we are thereby _creating more evil_, and therefore have no leg to stand on when we contemptuously judge them for their misbehavior.

You would see that even the most evil person is fundamentally redeemable — because they are _you_, after all, just exposed to a vastly different set of causes and conditions. They're only able to cause harm because they haven't seen the truth yet. In fact, this is the only reason that _anybody_ is able to cause (intentional) harm. And this realization lies on a spectrum; it's not black and white. The more deeply you see it, the less willing you are to hurt others (or "the environment") — because you can perceive the astonishing network of causality by which harming "others" ultimately harms yourself.

You would see that hating people for not realizing this makes exactly as much sense as hating the mentally ill or retarded: if they could clearly see the distortion that has gripped their mind, they couldn't possibly want it. In fact, hating "bad people" is _worse_ than hating the mentally ill, because it is secretly designed to push them _deeper into the abyss_; to create more evil. The way this works is fascinating.

The deepest part of you can **always** sense your equality with all beings. Contempt is the pretense that you are _fundamentally better_. It is a manifestation of your own darkness; your own delusion. By displaying (genuine) contempt, you are wearing your darkness on your sleeve. Your target instinctively recognizes it (if only subconsciously), and it triggers their own darkness in turn. It makes them perceive you in exactly the way you perceive the "bad people": as _evil._ They therefore feel morally obligated to fight you.

Of course, their digging in their heels just further convinces you that they really are bad, which licenses you to escalate your righteous wrath. The "net enmity" in the world thus increases. But far from being an unfortunate side effect of your "good intentions," this is secretly _the whole point._ Something within you isn't yet ready to see your commonality with all beings, and it manufactures clever ways to keep that realization at bay. It creates and maintains enemies specifically so that you don't have to wake up.

Why is it not ready for you to wake up? Because if you were too suddenly exposed to the Truth, you would discover that all the contempt you heaped on them was every bit as "evil" as what you were violently blaming them for in the first place. It originated from the same misperception, and it perpetuated the same delusion in the world, in exactly the same way. Your enemies were _knowingly_ darkening the world at some level — but so were you. It is impossible to overstate the agony of being forced to confront this without the necessary psychological safety mechanisms in place.

Yes, (some of) your political enemies may indeed be dangerous hypocrites, voting for harmful policies out of spite while pretending to be righteous. And yes, at a deep level, part of them knows that they're doing this, though they are unable to admit it even to themselves. But if you could really see the full set of conditions that shaped them, you could never feel contempt. You could only feel compassion — if not for them, exactly, then for the human condition as a whole.

To be clear: this doesn't mean that you would be _nice._ Sometimes "tough love" may be necessary, as may be _apparent_ contempt. But if you still perceive other people as somehow _fundamentally morally defective_ (and thus completely unlike you), then you are still firmly in the grip of precisely the delusion that you think you are fighting — and you can only increase it, while being flawlessly convinced that you are helping. To be clear, this is a perception and not just a belief. If you can still feel contempt, malice, or self-righteousness, then it is still operating.

It's not that evil doesn't exist; it's that it doesn't work the way we normally think. From the inside, it doesn't feel evil. It feels exactly the way you do when you mock or shame your political enemies. A tiny aspect of your mind knows _perfectly well_ that what you're doing will harm the world, but that knowledge is very cleverly shielded from conscious self-reflection. It feels more than okay, because all you can hear are your own justifications. This is exactly how it feels to be a greedy banker, or corrupt politician, or hypocritical CEO — and every time you engage in it, you strengthen the same capacity in others. 

This is the hardest thing to describe. Evil never stays confined to your own mind; it always finds a way to leak out. By engaging in self-deception, you are sending ripples of darkness out into the world, where they will have far-ranging impacts on events distant in time and space. You will be able to convincingly disown any connection to them, but the connection always remains. Part of you can always perceive this, and one day it will be made fully conscious.

There's a popular idea that if we just rounded up all the "evil people" and rid ourselves of them, the world would be better off. The problem with this idea is that it is generated by _precisely_ the same aspect of mind that it pretends to be fighting — and it is secretly designed to reinforce it.

All the darkness in the world is intimately connected, and part of it lives deep within your own mind. Its cleverest trick is to make you externalize it; perceive it as existing only "out there." In particular, it makes you perceive evil as being _intrinsic_ to some minds and not others. The latter deserve your compassion, while the former deserve only contempt. It is a lie.

We've all had the experience of skirting our conscience. Part of us knows _perfectly well_ that we're doing wrong, but this knowledge is carefully shielded from conscious self-reflection. All we hear is our own justifications. It is precisely this same self-deceptive mechanism that has enabled _all the evil there ever was._ "Bad people" know perfectly well that they're doing wrong; even to the point where it can be called intentional — and yet this knowledge (or its _wrongness_) is also cleverly hidden.

If you want to destroy evil, you have to defeat this shielding; to expose the very deepest aspect of people's minds to what they're really doing. Yet if you simply rub people's noses in their misbehavior (e.g., by mocking or shaming them), it tends to backfire; they just dig in their heels. What's going on?

What's happening is that the part of you that's trying to rub their noses in it is _precisely_ the self-deceptive mechanism that you're contemptuously judging them for. Part of you _wants_ "bad people" to get worse; to dig in their heels. It wants to shove their minds deeper into the abyss; to _strengthen_ their capacity for self-deception. Why? Because it craves the feeling of self-righteousness — and the deeper in you push them, the more delicious (and justified) it will be when you violently defeat them.

This may sound extreme, but it's exactly why the US is headed toward civil war without anybody recognizing their own complicity. But it's not your fault, either — not exactly, anyway. We're all familiar with the idea that the elites are playing regular people off each other to take attention away from themselves, but the rabbit hole goes _so much deeper._

Self-deception is caused by a kind of parasite in the mind. It makes you feel different and special, whether based on physical characteristics (like skin color) or mental ones (such as being a "good person"). It uses your specialness to make you perceive certain people as _fundamentally defective._ Instead of recognizing "bad people" as being under the sway of a nasty parasite — one that you yourself share — you perceive them to be _fundamentally morally defective_; completely unlike you.

This makes you treat them with contempt — which is an unmistakable signal to their parasite that _you_ are infected. It serves as a kind of "secret handshake," activating both their parasite and those of anyone who witnesses your state — friends, enemies, and bystanders alike. In fact, your parasites are not truly separate. They behave more like outgrowths of a single malevolent distributed entity. If your parasite is the infamous devil on your shoulder, then this "entity" is the _Devil_ — and it "really exists."

That is to say, you can begin to perceive just how intimately connected all the evil in the world actually is — and how intertwined it is with your own mind. So much of you what you blame "out there" is the result of something that originated "in here." But there seems to be a powerful force actively preventing each one of us from confronting our full complicity in the world's ills — and it flows freely between us, beneath our conscious thresholds. This is very hard to describe, but maybe you've tasted it before.

Ultimately, it is this "entity" that is playing all of humanity against itself, to take attention off of _it_ — and we keep falling for it. Yes, there is great darkness in the world, and it must be fought relentlessly. But if you still perceive it as existing only "out there," then you are still acting as its minion — and you will feel _completely confident_ that you are not.

Why do we enjoy mocking and shaming our political enemies? Is it to help them (or others) "see the light" and to make the world a better place? Or is it to revel in our own superiority?

We don't get to see all the downstream effects of our behavior — such as a humiliated father venting his frustration on his children, who then grow up to become "bad people" themselves. And even if by some miracle we do, we easily avoid recognizing our own complicity. Sure, we may have provoked him, but it was _his_ responsibility to handle it with grace. The fact that he didn't is just more evidence that he's _bad_.

The truth is that there is an aspect of your mind that is more than willing to darken the world for its own (supposed) benefit — though it will never let you see the full extent of its misbehavior. Part of your mind knew perfectly well that your target was likely to dig in his heels and become a worse person. In fact, it _intended_ this. But this knowledge was carefully hidden from conscious self-reflection; from that part of you that _knew better_. All you could consciously hear were your own (very clever) justifications.

It is precisely this same self-deceptive mechanism that has enabled _all the evil there ever was_ — and every time you engage in it, you reinforce this tendency in others. Your contempt for "bad people" doesn't actually exist to fight evil; it is secretly designed to create _more_ of it while convincing you that it is righteous. It is not until you realize just how badly you've been fooled that you begin to appreciate what is going on in the minds of the "bad people" — and thereby become able to combat it.

To be clear: mockery and shaming can probably be helpful tools under the right circumstances. But to the degree that you're wielding them with self-righteousness (which is basically always, for most of us), you are subconsciously telegraphing to the world your secret intent to darken it — and others pick up on this, whether they're aware of it or not. It acts as an invitation for them to do the same, whether they're nominally friends or enemies.

This self-deception is caused by a kind of parasite in the mind. It makes you feel different and special, whether based on physical characteristics (like skin color) or mental ones (such as being a "good person"). It uses your specialness to make you perceive certain people as _fundamentally defective._ For example, instead of recognizing "bad people" as being under the sway of a nasty parasite — one that you yourself share — you perceive them to be _fundamentally morally defective_, and thus worthy of harm.

It is that little devil on your shoulder — but unlike in the cartoons, it doesn't identify itself as such. It doesn't whisper obviously-bad ideas in your ear. No, it masquerades as your angel, disguising its sinister plans as _impossibly righteous._

Your devil can recognize when other people are similarly afflicted, and it attracts you to them. It makes you fixate on how _bad_ they are, encouraging you to be nasty in ways that will provoke _their_ devils (and those of anyone else in your orbit). You may be enemies on the surface, but under the cover your devils are secretly allied. In fact, they're not truly separate: they behave more like outgrowths of a single "distributed malevolent entity" that has captured _all_ of our minds — the _Devil_, if you will.

We're all familiar with the idea that the elites are playing regular people off each other to take attention away from themselves, but the rabbit hole goes _so much deeper._ Ultimately, this entity is playing all of humanity against itself, to take attention off of _it_. It is playing a much bigger game than we can fathom — and we keep falling for its same old trap. Yes, there is great darkness in the world, and it must be fought relentlessly. But if we still perceive it as intrinsic to some minds and not others (most notably, not our own), then we are still acting as its minions — and we will feel _completely confident_ that we are not.

To be clear, there _are_ people who are so deeply infected that the label "evil" may indeed serve a useful purpose. Their parasites are _particularly_ clever at convincing you to perceive their evil as intrinsic.

Your true enemy is never actually other people, but this remarkable mind-virus that has infected all of our minds. The entire fight against evil comes down to seeing this clearly.

"Kindness" may be the most misunderstood word in the English language. It doesn't mean being nice, or sweet, or tolerant, or understanding. True kindness can be fierce, or possibly even violent, as the situation warrants. Understanding this requires noticing something about our minds — something that we often avoid looking at.

[//]: # (Have you noticed how quick we are to label others "bad people" and treat them with contempt? It feels like this is a sign of the good within us, but it's actually a sign of something much darker. Yes, there are people acting in profoundly harmful &#40;and frankly, evil&#41; ways out there, but it isn't for the reason we normally think — and our contempt makes it worse, not better. In fact, contempt is secretly _designed_ to make things worse.)

[//]: # (They seem completely unlike us. But this is a powerful illusion, and it's caused by precisely the same mechanism in your mind that's permitting their misbehavior in the first place. )

When we misbehave, do we tolerate contemptuous judgement from others? No. Whether they have a valid point or not, such behavior makes us see them as "bad people," which triggers our instinct to put them in _their_ place. But this plays perfectly into their hand, because it validates their perception of us as bad, licensing them to escalate. Part of us knows that this was actually the whole point of their contempt: they were _pretending_ to help the world by being nasty to a "bad person," but they were secretly just baiting us so that they could look good themselves.

Contempt is _always_ a form of self-deception; a way to enrich or otherwise elevate ourselves at the world's expense. When directed at "bad people," it is designed to push them further into the abyss while appearing righteous on the surface. We don't mock our political enemies to help them (or anyone else) "see the light" or make the world a better place; we do it to prove how _bad_ they are, so that we may escalate our righteous wrath. This makes the world darker: it encourages more contempt in our allies and bystanders, and more self-deception in our enemies, too.

This is an extremely difficult thing to admit, because underneath it is a horrifying truth: that we are doing _exactly_ the thing that we're contemptuously judging others for. We are _knowingly_ darkening the world while pretending not to know. This fact is always completely accessible to consciousness, but we actively ignore it. We have no leg to stand on while we are still doing this.

The point is not to compare you with the worst people. There are indeed those whose self-deception has penetrated so deeply that they no longer have any intention to be of service to the world — and this is quite unlike yourself. But until you see clearly the mechanism that is allowing them to thrive in that abyss — and how it lives within you, too — you cannot help the world be rid of it. Indeed, you can only _reinforce_ it while flawlessly convinced that you're helping. And it is only possible to understand that mechanism by seeing clearly how it operates in your own mind.

You will find that the self-deceptive mechanism is caused by a kind of mind-virus. It works by convincing you that you are different and special. If you are not the kind of person that feels special due to your race or gender, then it will leverage your identity as a "good person." It will actively prevent you from seeing that the "bad people" are infected by precisely the same virus, so that you will perceive them as _fundamentally defective_ and thus inferior. You will thus make them _worse_ people while convinced that you were helping, which will reinforce your identity of being one of the noble few. By needing to see yourself as a "good person," you will succeed in creating an endless supply of "bad people." It is completely inevitable. This is what the Buddhists know as the _ego._

You and the target of your contempt may be enemies on the surface, but the truth is that your parasites are secretly allied. Your contempt signals to them that you yourself are infected, and it acts like a kind of "secret handshake" — one that it knows they will accept, because all parasites are fundamentally the same. In fact, they aren't truly separate. They behave more like limbs of a single "distributed malevolent entity" that is continually manipulating _all_ of our minds, driving us toward various kinds of Armageddon; situations in which everyone is violently proving just how righteous they are. It is why the US is headed toward civil war without anyone suspecting their own complicity, and explains bitter [divorces](https://www.gottman.com/blog/this-one-thing-is-the-biggest-predictor-of-divorce/) in which each side feels like the exclusive victim / hero. If our individual parasites are that little devil on our shoulders, then this "distributed entity" is the _Devil._

It is said that the elites are playing regular people off each other to take attention away from themselves, but the Devil is playing a _much bigger game._ It is playing all of humanity against itself — and we keep falling for its same stupid trap. Yes, there is great darkness in the world, and it must be fought relentlessly. But if we still perceive it as _intrinsic_ to some minds and not others (most notably, not our own or our allies'), then we are still doing its bidding — and we will feel completely confident that we are not. This is precisely what it's tricking us into doing by hating the "bad people" seemingly behind the world's ills. By doing so, we never notice our own complicity.

You know how some people believe that there's an evil global conspiracy behind all the world's ills? Well, this is it: the _primordial_ evil conspiracy; the one to which all the rest ultimately owe their existence, and to which they all filter up. It hides itself from conscious awareness, lurking in the shadows of our minds, whispering in our thoughts, communicating with itself beneath our conscious thresholds. It keeps us perpetually fixated on the evil "out there," so that we never discover the astonishing depths of our own complicity. Yes, there is an evil global conspiracy — and we are its minions. 

But there is a way to give up your seat at the table: you must remember your own "inner Light." How will you know when you've found it? Because you will be unable to feel even a trace of malice, contempt, or self-righteousness. It is not that you will stop seeing evil, but you will stop seeing it as _intrinsic_ to anyone. It's not just a change in belief, but a change in your very perception — and it makes all the difference in the world. This is true kindness, and it doesn't mean being nice. Sometimes kindness must be fierce, or possibly even violent. It might look like mocking or shaming. It might even look like a bullet. But whatever form it takes, it will serve the purpose of _evicting_ the parasites from people's minds. I cannot tell you exactly how this works, but I know you have felt it before. Some people are much harder cases than others — but the feeling that anyone is _impossible_ is always our own parasite talking. It just means that we don't have the necessary skill yet (and ought to be extra careful).

All the darkness in the world is intimately connected, and part of it lives deep within your very own mind. Malice, contempt, and self-righteousness are its **unmistakable** signatures. Once you have glimpsed this, you can begin to uproot the core delusion and be of actual service. Your true enemy is not actually other people, but the horrifying parasite that has infected _all_ of our minds. May we remember this and join the fight against it — the only fight that ultimately matters.

Whether they have a valid point or not, such behavior makes it obvious that they don't have the moral authority to be judging anybody. You can practically _see_ the self-deception in their eyes, and it triggers the urge to put them in _their_ place — which they will take as evidence that they were right about you all along. They were baiting you, though they cannot admit it — and neither can you, when you are in their shoes.

When we encounter others in this state, we don't recognize them as being in the grip of a powerful delusion that we ourselves share; no, we perceive them to be _fundamentally morally defective,_ and thus worthy of only contempt. This is itself profound self-deception. The truth is that our contempt is secretly designed to push people further into the abyss; to _reinforce_ their capacity for self-deception. It encourages more contempt in our allies and bystanders, and invites our target to dig in their heels — which serves to convince us that they really are as bad as we feared, thus licensing righteous escalation. We may outwardly lament this outcome, but we secretly intended it.

The truth is that there is _always_ at least a sliver of goodness left in people, even when we — or even _they_ — can't consciously perceive it. Yet the very deepest aspect of your mind always can. Sooner or later you will have to confront this aspect — your conscience — and on that day you will discover that you were intentionally smothering the light in other people just to prove that you were "good" and they were "bad." You were _knowingly_ darkening the world for your own (supposed) benefit. You were doing _exactly_ the thing that you were viciously blaming others for. Ironically, you were doing it to prove just how different you were. It was always bound to fail.

The realization of your hypocrisy will hurt like Hell, but there will be a silver lining. You will see that you never wanted to cause harm; that indeed, you ultimately never _could_. And you will discover, to your great astonishment, that nobody else could, either. You and they only did it because you were badly confused. Your salvation lies not in confirming that you were one of the righteous few battling the hordes of evil, but in discovering your profound equality with all other beings; in deeply humbling yourself. As you discover your own primordial Goodness, you simultaneously discover it in everyone else — _especially_ those who you were convinced never had it.

---

We may scoff at this idea, telling ourselves that they _have_ no such part — or that even if they do, it's too deeply buried to matter — and that they therefore deserve only our contempt. But the truth is that _this is itself profound self-deception._

See, there's this wacky spiritual idea that we're all One, and that upon enlightenment you'll fully realize this. But the truth is that part of you always already knows it. You know that you are guilty of precisely the same self-deception that you see in others. Sure, maybe not to the same degree as the worst offenders, but the mechanism is exactly the same. You've skirted your conscience before, pretending either that you couldn't hear it or that you didn't have to listen. In that moment, part of you knows _perfectly well_ that you're doing wrong, but that knowledge is cleverly shielded from conscious self-reflection.

What may be less obvious is that treating people with contempt is exactly such an example. Contempt isn't actually there to help you fight evil; it only feels that way. It is actually designed to push people further into the abyss; to _reinforce_ their self-deceptive tendencies. You are trying to remind them that they have no "inner light," and by doing so, you are smothering it further. Again, this isn't by accident: a deep part of you knows perfectly well that this is what you are doing, if only you would listen.

That's why wise people urge compassion for evildoers. They're not being naive, and they're not telling us to be nice, sweet, or understanding. 

---

The greatest trick the Devil ever pulled was to convince you that he doesn't exist within your own mind; that evil exists only "out there," where it is your duty to valiantly (and violently) defeat it. It is the ultimate trap.

The truth is that each one of us has skirted our conscience before, pretending either that we couldn't hear it or that we didn't need to. This is a kind of self-deception: part of us knows _perfectly well_ that we're doing wrong, but that knowledge is carefully shielded from conscious self-reflection. We know that we've done this before, but we're not aware of just how often. Our minds only allow us to see a carefully curated subset of our misbehavior; the tip of the iceberg, so as to maintain our self-image as "good people."

_All_ evil ultimately depends on precisely this same mechanism: people know perfectly well when they're doing wrong, but that _wrongness_ is very cleverly hidden from conscious self-reflection. Instead, they only hear their own justifications. When we witness people in this state, we perceive them as _fundamentally morally defective._ Just bring to mind anyone you see as a "bad person" and check if this is true. We don't recognize that they're caught in the grip of a powerful spell; one that we ourselves are painfully susceptible to. We feel compelled to violently attack them (if only emotionally) — and it feels like this urge comes from our inner goodness. But this is a dark lie.

> _We judge ourselves by our intentions and others by their actions._

Self-deception is caused by an _insanely clever_ parasite in the mind. It makes you overlook the interconnectedness of reality; your deep commonality with other beings. The ultimate truth is that you _are_ everyone (and everything) else, in a profound and surprising sense. This is supposedly only realized fully upon _enlightenment,_ but all of us can sense it at all times. Your parasite lulls you into forgetting — and by doing so, makes you treat "others" in a way that encourages _them_ to forget, too. Hating "bad people" is an attempt to distance yourself further from them — and it works by encouraging them (and others) to become _worse people._

Think about how it feels to be treated with contempt. It doesn't matter whether the person is right about your behavior: their contempt is an unmistakable sign that they are under the sway of their parasite. They're pretending to do the world a service but are really just virtue signaling. How in the world do they think that they have the moral authority to be judging you? This is flagrantly obvious from your perspective, but not from theirs. This shouldn't surprise us, because we do exactly the same thing.

We don't hate "bad people" to make the world a better place, _but to make it worse_. Our hatred is secretly a way to telegraph to them (and others) that the very same darkness lives within ourselves. Ostensibly, our "righteous wrath" is a way to strike fear into them; to show them what we're really capable of, so that they think twice. But while this may suppress their misbehavior for a time, what we've really accomplished is convincing their parasite that it _needs_ to exist, to combat ours. It has found exactly the excuse it needs to burrow deeper into their minds. They thus appear _more_ evil to us — evil that we think we have just uncovered, but have actually freshly created.

We tell ourselves that this isn't our fault: that we were only doing our best to "fight evil," and if this made them dig in their heels, it is just more evidence of their fundamental defectiveness. _But this is the deepest of lies._ If you look carefully enough into your mind in that moment — and this is the hardest part — you will see that something within you actually orchestrated this whole dance. And the thing that makes it hard for you to see this is _precisely_ the thing that makes it impossible for the "bad people" to confront their misbehavior in the first place. 

Your parasite's job is to make you feel special. 

It is impossible to free others of their darkness until this becomes painfully clear. Until then, we are only capable of spreading darkness while flawlessly convinced that we are helping.

Our parasites are continually driving us toward various kinds of Armageddon; situations in which everyone is violently proving just how righteous they are. It is why the US is headed toward civil war without anyone suspecting their own complicity, and explains bitter [divorces](https://www.gottman.com/blog/this-one-thing-is-the-biggest-predictor-of-divorce/) in which each side feels like the exclusive victim / hero. It is said that "the elites" are playing us off each other to take attention away from their devious activities, but the parasite is playing a _much_ bigger game: one that pits _all of humanity_ against itself — and we are continually falling for its sinister trap.

You know the "evil global conspiracy" that some people fear exists? This is what they are subconsciously sensing — the _primordial_ evil conspiracy; the one to which all the rest owe their existence, and to which they all ultimately report. Our parasites together behave like a "distributed malevolent entity," continually communicating with itself beneath our conscious thresholds. If the parasite is that devil on our shoulders, then this entity is the _Devil_. It hides itself perfectly in the shadows of our minds, whispering in our thoughts. It keeps us fixated on the evil "out there," where we can't help but violently attack it — not realizing that we are secretly doing its evil bidding. Except that part of us _does_ realize. We just pretend not to — again, _exactly_ the thing we contemptuously judge others for.

Yes, there are people out there _knowingly_ doing wrong; conspiring to bring great harm. But the "big reveal" is that we are secretly _feeding_ them through our very contempt. They are acting as reservoirs for the Darkness; magnets to which we feel irresistibly drawn. They are uniquely powerful at provoking our own inner darkness in a way that flawlessly convinces us that we're helping. It is the ultimate trap. Yes, they must be defeated — but doing so requires _much_ more precision and self-awareness than we have brought to bear so far.

This is why wise people urge compassion for evildoers. They're not telling us to be nice. They are warning us about this very trap. Compassion (aka kindness) can actually be fierce or even violent. It can _look_ like mocking or shaming. But to the degree that you're connected to your own "inner light" — i.e., not under the sway of your own darkness — you cannot feel even a _trace_ of malice, contempt, or self-righteousness. You do not perceive a _fundamentally defective person_. This makes all the difference in the world. I can't tell you exactly how this works, but you've felt it before. Their parasite comes face-to-face with what it fears most: that-which-is-incorruptible; genuine goodness. It is robbed of its excuse to burrow deeper into the mind of its host, and is thereby weakened.

Again, the outward behavior may look absolutely nothing like "kindness" in its conventional sense. It may even look like a bullet. But on the inside, you always know.


[//]: # (Contempt, malice, self-righteousness, etc. exist only to elevate yourself at the world's expense. This is the very thing you hate in others, but in the moment, you don't recognize this.)

What we don't realize is that hating such people only _deepens_ their capacity for self-deception; it makes them _worse_ people.

When we hate "bad people," we're ostensibly trying to force them to confront their misbehavior, but that's not what's actually happening. If you look carefully, you'll discover that hatred, malice, contempt, etc. are secretly designed to trigger their defense mechanisms; to make it _harder_ for them to confront their conscience. Their apparent recalcitrance "proves" that they really are as bad as we thought, which then "forces" us to escalate our righteous wrath.

Why do we do this? For those of us who fancy ourselves "good people," our subconscious works hard to maintain this pristine self-image. In addition to hiding our own self-deception from us, it ensures that we overlook any sliver of good left in the "bad people." We don't recognize others as being in the grip of a powerful self-deception that we ourselves share; no, we see people who are _fundamentally defective,_ and thus completely unlike us. This licenses us to shove them further into the abyss while calling it "righteous."

The grand irony is that this behavior is _itself_ the very deception that we're bitterly accusing others of. We are creating more evil in the name of good, while being profoundly unaware that we are doing so. This is itself the most clever and well-disguised form of evil. Our subconscious knows that we're doing this — indeed, it is doing it _on purpose_ — but it is exceedingly difficult to admit this to ourselves.

Yet admitting it is precisely what we must do in order to become of actual service. **It is not until we expose this deepest of deceptions — of being one of the noble few, battling the hordes of evil "out there" — that we fully comprehend the horrifying mechanism that enables the "bad people" to do what they do in the first place.** Until then, we are only capable of _amplifying_ evil while flawlessly convinced that we're fighting it.

What we eventually discover is that there is a kind of mind-virus that has overtaken all of humanity. It alters our very perception, so that we see others as fundamentally different from ourselves, and therefore okay (or even _righteous_) to harm. For the Nazis, it was the Jews; for the Hutus, the Tutsis; and for "good people," it is the "bad" — _whoever they are to you_. This parallel may sound offensive until you recognize what it is pointing to.

To be clear: treating everyone identically, and always being nice and understanding, would surely be naive. There indeed people for whom the infection has penetrated so deeply that they have no conscious awareness of any goodness within; no conscious intention to be of any help. In this case, the label "evil" may actually be of some use. But also notice that we have a strong tendency to call people "evil" even when they're far from it. This is the virus at work.

In either case, perceiving them as _fundamentally_ different is **always** a trap. It is never inspired by the goodness within you, but only ever by your own parasite. The goodness within you can always perceive the light in others (no matter how buried), and wants nothing more than to rekindle it; to _free_ them of their parasite — even if this requires being fierce, or possibly even violent. Your parasite — your darkness — only wants to further smother their light; to _reinforce_ their parasite, while convincing you that this is good and necessary. Everything comes down to telling these urges apart, which is far trickier than it seems. Sometimes, true kindness looks nothing like "kindness" on the outside — but deep within, you always know.

We're all familiar with the idea that the elites are playing regular people off each other to take attention away from themselves, but the rabbit hole goes _so much deeper._ Ultimately, the parasite is playing all of humanity against itself, to take attention off of it — and we keep falling for it, with gusto. It continually goads us into various forms of Armageddon; situations in which everyone is violently proving just how righteous they are. It is why the US is headed toward civil war without anyone suspecting their own complicity, and explains bitter [divorces](https://www.gottman.com/blog/this-one-thing-is-the-biggest-predictor-of-divorce/) in which each side feels like the exclusive victim / hero.

Yes, there is great darkness in the world, and it must be fought relentlessly. But if we still perceive it as having infected some people and not others (most conspicuously, not ourselves), we are still acting as its minions while convinced that we're nobly fighting it — and we will secretly invite others to "nobly" fight us in turn. There is just no way around this. That is its core trick.

All the darkness in the world is intimately connected, and part of it lives deep within your very own mind. Malice, contempt, and self-righteousness are its unmistakable signatures. It is only once you have glimpsed this that you can begin to uproot the delusion and be of actual service.

Your true enemy is not actually other people, but the horrifying parasite that has infected _all_ of us. May we all remember this before it is too late.

When wise people urge compassion for evildoers, they're not just being naive. They're not suggesting we be nice, or sweet, or forgiving, or even understanding. No; they see something that we don't. Namely, that our urge to be cruel to "bad people" comes from _exactly_ the same place that enables such people to be "bad" in the first place — and it accomplishes just as much good.

When you're nasty to a "bad person," part of you is secretly trying to make them _worse._ Or rather, it's trying to provoke a reaction that will prove to you that they're just as bad as you think they are. And the horror is, it works. Why? Because your nastiness is a clear giveaway that you're not someone with the moral authority to be scornfully judging anyone. They see in your eyes precisely the same failure that they're guilty of, and they're not going to let you get away with pretending that _yours_ is somehow noble.

From your perspective, this apparent recalcitrance proves that they really are beyond help, and licenses escalation. After all, any _decent_ person would have simply repented in the face of such righteous wrath. But this is exactly the lie: it is certainly possible to be fierce in a way that combats evil and forces introspection, but that's not what you were trying to do. You were trying to display contempt — not just for their behavior or beliefs, but for _them_. It is a look that says "you are fundamentally irredeemable — and I'm going to make sure you _know_ it."

You may be convinced that this person is literally incapable of any good, but you don't _know_ that. If there is even the tiniest sliver of "light" left in them; any possibility of redemption; your contempt is carefully designed to extinguish it. It is an act of profound violence, and it doesn't come from your inner goodness. While you're in its sinister grip, you don't consciously recognize this. You _think_ you're doing something good, but your eyes tell a different story — one that your "target" easily picks up on.

Your subconscious isn't actually trying to help the world in that moment; it's merely trying to prove you right. It's trying to reassure you that all the evil in the world exists only "out there," and that it is your righteous duty to violently smash it. It does this to distract you from the darkness "in here." But ironically, it is that very darkness "in here" that is acting through you at that very moment, enacting a very clever plot to create _more_ darkness in the world under the guise of good. Doing so will reinforce your worldview that you are one of the righteous few, battling the hordes of evil out there.

All the darkness in the world is intimately connected, and part of it lives firmly within your very own mind. It hides itself from your consciousness in _insanely_ clever ways. It constantly redirects your attention away from your own darkness, so that you're continually obsessed with the evil "out there." Whenever it can plausibly claim to have found some, it concocts a clever plot to make you _reinforce_ it under the guise of good, so that you never suspect what you're actually doing.

When we mock our political opponents and they just double down on their idiocy, we may act dismayed, but part of us secretly _wanted_ it. That's because the more obviously-evil they become, the more justified we will be when we are one day forced to "take the kid gloves off" and _really_ show them our teeth. Nothing feels quite as good as violently dismantling Evil. We will never notice all the tiny things we cumulatively did to push them into a position where such violence would become necessary. If someone gently points this out to us, we will just scoff and write them off as stupid or naive. Can't they see that we were "fighting evil"? What were _they_ doing?

If someone points it out _contemptuously_, we will perceive them as evil themselves. Think about how you feel when someone stands in contemptuous judgement of you. Whether they have a valid point or not, you can sense that they don't have your best interest at heart. In fact, they don't have _anyone's_ best interest at heart — except, perhaps, their own. They are doing to you exactly the thing I'm warning about above. They _want_ to get a rise out of you, because your recalcitrance will prove to them that they have indeed located one of the secret hiding places of evil, and thus are licensed to extinguish it by any means necessary. This is "evil," and it triggers your natural instinct to fight back.

What you can't see in that moment is that the Darkness is playing a horrific game through both of you. We're all familiar with the idea that the elites are playing regular people off each other to take attention away from themselves, but the rabbit hole goes _so much deeper._ There is a kind of parasite that has infected **all** of our minds, and it is playing all of humanity off itself to create a world of pure darkness. It presently seems to be winning that fight, in a positive feedback loop: the more we mindlessly play its game of "see evil, smash evil," the more evil we create.

Your true enemy isn't actually other people, but this astonishing virus that has captured all of our minds. The real fight against evil only begins once you see clearly how it operates.

The way it works is astonishingly simple. Think about what's "wrong with the world," and bring to mind the people responsible. Notice the feelings of malice, contempt, or self-righteousness that arise. Notice how it feels convincingly like this is your inner goodness responding. It's not. It is your darkness masquerading as your goodness. If you listen to it, you _will_ behave in some way that creates more darkness in the world, even as you are flawlessly convinced that you're helping. It is precisely this same illusion that has given rise to every atrocity that humans have ever perpetuated, even if the outer details differ considerably.

Those sentiments — malice, contempt, and self-righteousness — exist for _only_ one purpose: to blind you to what your subconscious is secretly doing. In fact, such blindness is the only way that anyone is ever able to (knowingly) cause harm. Part of them knows _perfectly well_ that they're doing wrong, but this knowledge is very carefully shielded from conscious self-reflection. Think about the political opponent example. Part of you knows that your cruelty will just create more enmity in the world, but you somehow can't get yourself to admit it in the moment. Something almost identical is happening in the minds of "evil people" to permit them to do what they do. They know _perfectly well,_ but that knowledge is cleverly hidden from the part of them that would put an end to it.

When you fight them or try to force them to confront their misbehavior _with contempt_, you're not actually trying to help. You are simply under the sway of the same illusion that they are. _Your_ darkness is secretly helping theirs hide itself from the tiny part of them that knows better; a part that they've (consciously) forgotten even exists. If you actually want to help, the "trick" is to _see_ that they are under the command of this mind-virus and don't ultimately want to be doing its bidding (the key word being _ultimately_). It's not enough to simply _believe_ this, or else you may end up just being _nice_ (which can be dangerous). You must actually gain direct insight into how the virus has ensnared their mind. This is the only way to evict it instead of empowering it. This is true kindness, and it is **not** about being nice.

Entire volumes could be written on how to gain such complete insight, and we don't have room for that here. But it all begins by realizing that all the evil that you hate "out there" exists in latent form "in here" — and that you are only capable of fighting it to the degree that you're not falling into its oldest trick yourself. A good litmus test is to ask yourself how easily you fall into malice, contempt, or self-righteousness when confronted with evil or injustice. Equivalently, check whether you see evil as _intrinsic_ to your enemies' minds. These are all unmistakable signs that the darkness is secretly operating in you, undetected. Until you see this clearly, you cannot help but unwittingly spread it.

Make no mistake: it is _extremely painful_ to discover that you yourself have been spreading evil — and that part of you always knew it perfectly well, even as you were doing it. This discovery knocks the sanctimonious wind right out of you, as you're brought to your knees with the horrifying realization that you're every bit as fallible as the people you've been contemptuously judging. Alas, this realization often only lasts a short while until you get right back on your high horse. This is something I know all too well.

Kindness and compassion (which we'll use interchangeably) may be the most misunderstood words in the English language. They don't mean being nice, or sweet, or tolerant, or understanding. The reason we _believe_ they mean these things is that part of our mind is trying to wriggle out of being kind even when deep down we know it's the right thing to do — and it is _always_ the right thing to do.

You see, there is an aspect within every one of us that is willing to harm the world for our own benefit. This is an extremely painful thing to admit — especially if we fancy ourselves "good people" — and so we avoid confronting it. 

[//]: # (This is what gives rise to the psychological tendency known as the _fundamental attribution error_ — briefly, that we judge ourselves by our intentions but others by their actions.)

We don't mock our political opponents to help them (or anyone else) "see the light," or to make the world a better place (like our conscious minds tell us). We do it to further distance ourselves from them; to remind ourselves of how much "better" we are. Part of us knows perfectly well that this will make them worse people — and not only are we okay with this; we're secretly trying to _create_ that outcome.

[//]: # (Our subconscious keeps this a secret even from ourselves — which is why you may not believe me when I tell you.)

It's not that mocking and shaming are intrinsically bad. They can probably be helpful in the right circumstances. But if there's even a trace of malice, contempt, or self-righteousness behind them, your subconscious is lying to you about its true motivation. It isn't actually _trying_ to help the world or other people in that moment. It's trying to prove you right; that your target really _is_ as horrible as you perceive them to be. And this strongly-held intention will encourage them to _become_ the villain that you need them to be to uphold your worldview and self-image.

What you can't see in that blinded state is that minds are infinitely flexible — including the ones you've written off. Deep down — perhaps beneath their conscious thresholds — they know this about themselves, too. They can feel you attempting to erase this knowledge; to convince them that they're irredeemable. This makes you appear _evil_ to them, which triggers their natural reflex to _fight evil_. This somehow doesn't alert you to the possibility that you might be doing something wrong, like it should. On the contrary, it serves as conclusive proof that _they_ are evil, licensing you to escalate. This is how your subconscious creates new evil in the world while enabling you to feel righteous about it.

All evil is ultimately enabled by a similar smokescreen. There is a mechanism in our minds that hides our misbehavior from ourselves. It's surely true that some people's misbehavior is much worse than our own, but the basic pattern is the same. Part of their mind is carefully hiding the knowledge of the _wrongness_ of their actions from conscious self-reflection. It is a self-deception that we all share. You have a sacred responsibility to help them undo it. And it begins with seeing that self-righteous judgement isn't actually an attempt to do that, even though it very convincingly feels that way.

Notice how it feels like some people know _perfectly well_ what they're doing and choose to do it anyway; thus they really _are_ irredeemable, and deserve only contempt. Here's the problem: you can know something _perfectly well_ and simultaneously hide it from consciousness. For example, you know "perfectly well" that mocking your political opponents makes the world a worse place, but you still can't get yourself to admit it when it counts. Until you see how brilliantly your own subconscious hides your own misbehavior from you, you will never understand the fiendish mechanism that enables "bad people" to do what they do — and thus never discover the secret key that undoes it.

What is this "secret key"? The fact that all minds are redeemable isn't just a belief; it is something that you can learn to perceive directly. In fact, part of you already perceives it. There is an astonishing sense in which you are everyone and everything, and deep down you've always known it. I know this sounds like a vague and woo-woo mystical fantasy, but it really is true. It is why acts of great kindness inspire you so powerfully, even when you gain no obvious personal benefit from them. Whatever benefits the Whole benefits you, because _you are the Whole_. You long most deeply to remember this.

The more thoroughly you remember this, the more you realize that forsaking anyone else is forsaking yourself. Some part of you doesn't yet feel worthy of remembering the full truth, and so it finds secret ways to intensify conflict in your world, and then blames it on the world, to keep the truth hidden. **This is in no way your fault.** More self-blame will not help. Only healing the inner conflict will. This is a gift that you can then offer others.

Kindness is any behavior that induces this remembrance in "others" — or really, in the Whole. It isn't always gentle or nice. Sometimes compassion must be fierce, or perhaps even violent. It may even require what appears to be mockery or shaming on the surface. But _under_ the surface, part of you always knows the difference — and your "target" does, too. They may still consciously perceive you as an enemy, but part of them slowly begins to remember what is really happening.

All the darkness in the world is connected, and part of it lives within your very own mind. Every time you feel the urge to externalize it, you're being given an opportunity to heal the part of it that you (and only you) have complete responsibility for. Don't turn away from that opportunity. It is the "secret key" that unlocks your potential to be of genuine service to the Whole. The worst possible place you can end up is fully externalizing evil, so that it exists only "out there" in loci that you perceive yourself to be valiantly defeating. This is the ultimate self-deception, masquerading as powerful "spiritual truth."

How would you behave if you knew that you are everyone, and everyone is you? All the victims, all the perpetrators — everyone. How would you treat "others" upon realizing this? In particular, how would you treat the _difficult_ people, the _bad_ people, the _evil_ people?

You would recognize the part of yourself that lives within them, and vice versa. You could not possibly feel any contempt, or malice, or animosity. Don't get me wrong: you would still oppose them — possibly fiercely or even violently — but you would be free of the illusion that your contemptuous judgement or self-righteous outrage was in any way benefiting the world.

You would see clearly that these sentiments exist **only** to push people _further_ from the truth; _away_ from recognition of our (surprising) commonality. **We hate "bad people" not to help them (or anyone else) see the Light, but to shove them further into the abyss**. We do this to make them _worse_ people, so that we can feel better by comparison; to continue pretending that we're fundamentally separate and superior. But there's one small problem.

This makes the world worse for our own (supposed) benefit, and part of us knows it. To avoid consciously confronting this horrifying fact, we hide it from ourselves, convincing ourselves that we are just "fighting evil." But now we're in an even bigger mess: not only are we darkening the world, we are lying to ourselves about it. Far from helping us distance ourselves from the "bad people," this subconsciously reminds us of our deep similarity — which we are now forced to hide even harder, resulting in a horrifying feedback loop from which it is _extremely_ difficult to escape.

This is the trap that (nearly) the whole world is caught in. We are all so busy hating the "bad people" out there that we don't realize what is going on in here; what we ourselves are contributing to the madness. In fact, that is _why_ we are doing it: to avoid confronting the darkness within.

Contempt **always** makes the world darker. This is a difficult thing to admit, but necessary. The mechanism that allows us to hide this truth from ourselves is _precisely_ the same one that allows the "bad people" to do what _they_ do without remorse. And the more we engage in this self-deception, the more we encourage them to do the same. It is inevitable. This is **exactly** the wrong thing to do if you want to see a more beautiful world, which you — _we_ — ultimately do.

Your enemy is not truly other people, but the darkness that has ensnared all of our minds. I don't mean this in an abstract sense. You can actually learn to perceive this "dark entity," communicating with itself beneath our conscious thresholds. The "evil" in other people's minds is reaching out to the latent evil within yours, encouraging you to mindlessly obey it in the name of "good." It is a kind of secret handshake, which we often unconsciously accept. It is the oldest trick in the book, and it somehow continues to fool us to this day.

People sometimes fear that there is an "evil conspiracy" behind all the world's ills, secretly pulling the strings. They are not crazy: they are sensing something authentic, and this is it. There _is_ a kind of evil conspiracy, and every last one of us is in on it. Every act of unkindness toward _anybody_ empowers it — and a deep part of us knows this. Being _kind_ doesn't mean being _nice._ It just means being awake to this trap.

Until we have seen the brilliant ruse by which the darkness seduces our own minds, it is impossible to understand what is going on in the minds of the "bad people" — and thus to do anything genuinely useful about it. That is why everything comes down to deeply knowing yourself. If there is any self-righteousness or contempt left, it is an unmistakable sign that your mind is still hiding something _big_ from you. Please find out what it is.

Your Light is capable of accomplishing everything you think you need your darkness for — and so much more. The world does not need more of our contempt. It needs our fierce, uncompromising Love — whatever form it must take. Let's help each other — _ourselves_ — remember this.

---


What if it were really true that you are literally everyone? All the victims, all the perpetrators — everyone. What would it be like to come back from discovering that?

The more deeply you saw it, the less able you would be to hate anyone. You would see that even the _worst_ person is only suffering from a kind of amnesia — and that hating them can only ever _deepen_ it. In fact, hatred is itself a manifestation of that very same amnesia.

Hating the "bad people" feels unmistakably righteous, but this is exactly the illusion that must be penetrated to understand how they are able to do what they do in the first place. They are under a kind of spell that makes their misbehavior feel okay — and our hatred is designed to make us behave in a way that makes them feel _more_ justified.

In other words, our malice does not _accidentally_ make the world a darker place; it is explicitly _designed_ to do that. There is a kind of parasite that lives in our minds, tricking us into pushing each other further into the dark while convincing us that it's _good_. When we cannot see the light in others, we feel impossibly _righteous_ for hating them — when in actuality this is the surest sign of our parasite controlling us.

We really don't want to be doing this — and the more you remember that you don't, the more your very way of being begins to remind "others" that they don't, either.

What if I told you that all the darkness in the world is connected — and that part of it lives deep within your own mind?

This might be the hardest thing for humans to accept, but it's the truth. There is unkindness deep within each of us that we hide from consciousness, and by letting it fester, we increase the chances of heartbreaking events occurring _somewhere_ on the planet — events that we then wring our hands at, not recognizing our own profound connection to them.

We don't recognize our own darkness because it always feels perfectly justified — or even _righteous_. The mechanism that is hiding yours from you is **exactly** the same one that prevents the "bad people" from consciously confronting the wrongness of _their_ behaviors. This mechanism exists within all of us, and it actively shields us from the full implications of our words and actions.

That's why it may not be obvious that being cruel to "bad people" — whoever you think they are — is itself a form of evil. This isn't a moral judgement, but something that you can learn to directly perceive. Such behavior increases the "net darkness" in the world. I can't tell you how it's possible to perceive such a thing, but it is.

It doesn't even require overt cruelty: simply by harboring contempt, malice, etc., you are lowering the bar for darkness to manifest itself somewhere. And the most horrifying discovery is that this isn't an accident. We don't hate bad people to make the world better, like our conscious minds tell us: we do it to distance ourselves from them by pushing them _further_ into the dark. This creates new evil, and a deep part of us knows this. We can't admit it to ourselves for exactly the same reason that they can't face what they are doing.

When we hide this fact from ourselves — by pretending that our animosity is _righteous_ — we are subconsciously inviting those around us to do the same. Whether they are "allies" or "enemies," their minds are made darker as a result. 
This causes a ripple effect out into the world, eventually causing horrors to materialize _somewhere_; often in a location distant enough in space and time that you will never consciously register their existence, let alone your connection to them. In fact, they are likely to induce _more_ outrage in you, causing you to pile on even *more* animosity. This is the vicious cycle that we see unfolding across the planet today.

When this is all made conscious, confronting evil feels entirely different. You see that our true enemy isn't actually other people, but the darkness that has ensnared all of our minds. You then behave in ways that help others become conscious of their shadows — whether that requires being _nice_ or _fierce_ (or possibly even violent). Either way, it is true kindness. It is completely absent of contempt, malice, and self-righteousness — and this makes all the difference.

It is not something you can fake or calculate your way to. If you are trying to *force* others to see it, there is almost certainly an element of contempt (and thus your own shadow) still operating. Nor is it binary. Rather, the more you clean up your own darkness, the more your very way of being begins to expose others to theirs.

This is the only path toward the "more beautiful world" your heart most deeply longs for — and it all begins with you.

[//]: # (Part of your mind enters that shadowy space that Carl Jung called the collective unconscious, and injects its own unique signature of darkness.)
[//]: # (If you'd like to think of it in less mystical terms, those sentiments subconsciously telegraph a secret intention to do something dark while pretending that it's okay — and inviting others to do the same. )

There's something inside us that loves to obsess over the faults of others — in particular, how _bad_ they are, and how if only they'd change, the world would be so much better. But one "big reveal" that both psychedelics and meditation offer is that this obsession is _always_ a cover for something going on inside of _us_, even though it so convincingly seems to be about others.

It's not that we're entirely _wrong_ about them, per se (though often we are). It's that the _contempt_ and _malice_ we feel are always in proportion to how much "inner work" we still have left to do. As we heal the darkness within, something astonishing happens: we increasingly discover that the "bad" we see in others is invisible to them in exactly the same way that ours was to us — and that our contempt existed only to make it _harder_ for them to notice and heal it.

The truth is that we are all hypocrites — especially those of us who are sure we're not. Part of what this means is that our minds hide certain unpleasant things about ourselves from ourselves. One of the most effective ways to do this is to keep our attention fixated outwards, on the flaws of others — and then to treat them in ways that _appear_ to be helpful, but are secretly designed to push them further into the abyss, so that we look better by comparison.

As this tendency subsides, 

The reason that _kindness_ is such a hard concept to define is that it's simply the _absence_ of this kind of self-deception.

By adulthood, most of us have realized that "hurt people hurt people" — and thus that kindness is sometimes the right approach when dealing with bad behavior. Such kindness doesn't have to be sweet and gentle — it can be fierce (or perhaps even violent) while still being firmly rooted in a fundamentally benevolent intent. It may be "tough love," but it is still love — not necessarily directed at the person specifically, but at the world as a whole, of which they are a part.

On the other hand, sometimes misbehavior seemingly cannot be explained by any kind of pain or "great battle." The person seems _fundamentally bad_. In such cases, compassion evaporates and is replaced by contempt or malice. We may still tell ourselves that it's for the "greater good," but the heartfelt benevolence is gone. Something much darker has taken its place.

It is easy to convince ourselves that these two are the same; that "tough love" and malicious harm can both be for the greater good.

A secret part of you knows perfectly well that treating _anyone_ with contempt just pushes them further into the dark — and it _enjoys doing so_. But given your self-image as a "good person," it can't do this to just anybody. That would reveal its presence to you. So it keeps a lookout for people who it can convince you _have_ no "inner light," so that contempt becomes the only option.

It is exactly the same mechanism that is responsible for their misbehavior in the first place. The details may differ, but its function is essentially the same: to make some (or even all) people appear deserving of contempt, so that certain self-serving tendencies may manifest.

Please know that I am not accusing you of anything. In fact, it is only by becoming aware of and then _deeply forgiving_ this part of yourself that you will understand _why_ it is misbehaving — at which point it will not only stop, but it will help you perceive the "great battles" in others that you previously could not see. Situations will shift from the "contempt" category into the "tough love" category, and your arsenal of tough love will grow.

There's a mechanism within our minds that actively blinds us to the far-ranging implications of our words and behaviors.

Consider a power- and money-hungry politician. He may start a war, which he will justify with noble-sounding motives. Whatever good comes of the war (if any), it will create a lot of needless suffering in the service of enriching him.

Does he _know_ this? Yes and no. Part of him knows _perfectly well_, but his mind is able to shield that knowledge behind an impenetrable wall of justifications. This is self-deception. We all know what this is like. Maybe not on that scale, but we have all overridden our conscience before. Part of us _definitely knows_ — but it's very hard to get us to look that knowledge in the eye.

When we watch a slimy politician in this state, we tend to feel contempt. And that contempt feels righteous; like it's there to help us fight his evil. But something much more interesting and insidious is actually going on.

Part of you knows that you have a tremendous capacity for self-deception. You subconsciously see something of yourself in his eyes. So your mind does something very clever: it treats him with cruelty.

When you are in a state of self-deception, and someone tries to point it out in a nasty way, what happens? You see them as a bad person — because you subconsciously know that they can only do this from a place of self-deception. It inspires you to be nasty in return. It justifies and reinforces your self-deception.

When we see that slimy politician, we tend to feel contempt. And that contempt feels righteous; like it's there to help us fight his evil. But something much more interesting and insidious is actually going on.

Your mind knows that by treating him with contempt, he will see _you_ as someone worthy of contempt, which will convince him that what he is doing is righteous after all. And that recalcitrance will in turn convince you that what you are doing is righteous. Hopefully you see where this is going.

Something within us enjoys fighting with the "bad people" and generally watching them be harmed or humiliated. Pause and see if that's true. We think this is a sign of the good within us, but it's actually a sign of something much darker.

We know that this behavior will make them worse. We may tell ourselves that it won't, or that it's their fault if it does, or that the benefits outweigh the drawbacks, but deep down we know that these are just lame excuses for malicious behavior. And it isn't just a side effect of otherwise-noble behavior: something in us _wants_ them to get worse, because the worse they get, the more vindicated we feel, and the more licensed we are to escalate our righteous wrath.

This idea may be threatening or offensive to our egos, but if we introspect deeply enough, we will find some truth in it.

We behave this way to reinforce our self-image as "good people," but there's a slight problem: deep down, we know that genuinely good people don't shove others further into the dark while calling it righteous. So not only are we acting from self-deception, but this knowledge forces us to suppress our awareness of it even harder, resulting in more powerful self-deception. We quickly become completely unable to consciously acknowledge that this is what we're really doing.

But this isn't something to feel guilty about. That just drives it further out of consciousness. It's actually caused by a kind of mind-virus; one that we all harbor. It's what the Buddhists know as the ego, and it's also commonly depicted as a devil on your shoulder. But what that image gets wrong is that the devil is actually extrinsic to your mind, while the angel represents your deepest nature.

Your devil's job is to make certain people appear _fundamentally defective_ and therefore subhuman, so that harming them becomes not just okay, but positively righteous. This is the trick that enables genocides, but it is operating in every one of us. (Ironically, the people most likely to slide down the path toward atrocities are those who are most convinced that they couldn't — for their devil has already bypassed their mind's most important safety checks. These are also the people who display the most contempt for "bad people.")

Your devil knows that "bad people" are only able to misbehave because they're under the sway of _their_ devil, but it hides this fact from you. It makes you perceive their evil as _intrinsic_, so that you'll viciously attack the person instead of their parasite. It knows that this will just drive the person further into its dark clutches, and it _wants_ this. Although you and they may be enemies on the surface, your devils are secretly _allied._

(It is worth pausing to appreciate how clever this is. When you enter the space of self-deception — which happens whenever you feel contempt — others can subconsciously sense this. This makes them perceive _you_ as "bad" for precisely the same reason that you see _them_ that way. They then feel compelled to attack you and/or justified in mistreating you. So all that is required to create evil is to _feel contempt_ — and it is easy to convince yourself that you haven't done anything wrong.)

Any time you hate someone, your devils are exchanging a kind of "secret handshake." In fact, they're not really separate. If you look carefully, you'll see that they behave more like outgrowths of a single distributed malevolent entity; the _Devil_, if you will. This sinister entity continually communicates with itself beneath our conscious thresholds, tricking us into empowering it while flawlessly convinced that we're fighting it.

It is the primordial "evil conspiracy"; the one to which all the rest ultimately filter up. Every time we feel malice, contempt, or even self-righteousness toward _anyone_ for _any reason_, we are secretly feeding the Beast. Every act of unkindness ripples through its terrible body, lowering the threshold for more acts of evil to erupt in distant locations — for which we will feel absolutely no complicity. But part of us always knows.

It is the perfect trap: a network of evil to which everyone contributes but for which nobody accepts responsibility. It is why the US is headed toward civil war while nobody recognizes their own part. It's not that we're all equally complicit. We're certainly not. But we're lying to ourselves if we believe that our contempt for the people most responsible is actually helping.

So then what are we supposed to do? After all, the only thing required for evil to thrive is for the good to do nothing. On the other hand, the only thing worse than letting evil win is secretly joining forces with it. I can't give a complete solution, but here's a start.

We must each become deeply aware of this darkness within. Otherwise, _every single thing_ we do to "fight" evil secretly just strengthens it, despite our conviction that we're helping. This rabbit hole goes deep — and the deeper we go, the more we perceive something curious: nobody _else_ wants to be infected by their parasite either, despite (what appears to be) compelling evidence to the contrary. Even those who _say_ they enjoy cruelty — the ones we classically think of as "evil" — are suffering from a kind of Stockholm Syndrome.

The more free we become of our parasite, the more we begin to perceive the "great battles" that are tricking other people into protecting theirs — even when they're not aware of these battles themselves. There is always an aspect of people's minds that doesn't want to be under its sway. This isn't just a belief; it is something you begin to _perceive._

Seeing this clearly enables us to behave in ways that help people evict their parasites — the only thing that genuinely removes evil from the world. (We may think that straight-up murdering evil people does too — but when it is done maliciously, it amplifies the darkness in others' minds, resulting in a net gain. Don't ask me how this works, but it is something you can learn to see. There is no "free lunch" here. We cannot bypass the hard inner work.)

[//]: # (Smothering their light. Extremely difficult to confront the full extent of our complicity. Inner Light. We also project badness when there is none.)

Such behavior is _compassion_ or _kindness_, and it doesn't mean being nice. Sometimes it must be fierce or even violent. But it comes from a completely different aspect of mind, and your "target" can sense this difference, even if only subconsciously. Their devil cannot find the slightest "hook" in your mind by which to justify itself, and so it is weakened, even if only imperceptibly. If you feel even a trace of self-righteousness — no matter how well hidden — you are giving it this hook.

In fact, if you even perceive the other person as "other," then there is still work left to be done. This is the hardest part to talk about. Reality is actually one seamless interconnected whole, and our separation is only apparent. This truth isn't unveiled fully until _enlightenment_, but we can all sense it to one degree or another at all times. The less a person senses this, the more "evil" they appear — and our cruelty is an attempt to make them sense it less. It is _exactly_ the wrong thing to do.

To be clear, compassion does not always tell you what the most helpful behavior _is_. That requires wisdom, which is a separate but related skill. Compassion just ensures that you are acting in accordance with your deepest values; that you are not falling victim to your self-deception. Before it is firmly in place, our strategies to defeat evil are actually no such thing. They always secretly contain an element meant to elevate or enrich us at the world's expense, unbeknownst to us.

Our true enemy is not actually other people. It is the powerful darkness that has captivated all of our minds. We each have a role to play in dispelling it, and it begins with ourselves. When we cannot see the Light in others — or worse, when we are convinced that it does not exist — this means we still have work to do. This is what we must remember if humanity is to survive.

What if nearly everything you're doing to "fight evil" is actually strengthening it — and moreover, what if part of you already knows this but is actively concealing it from your conscious mind?

There's an insidious mechanism in the minds of the "bad people" that shields them from confronting the full implications of their misbehavior. It's not that they _don't_ know that what they're doing is wrong. A deep part of them knows perfectly well — and yet the _wrongness_ is very cleverly hidden from conscious self-reflection. They both _know_ and yet somehow _don't._ This is the secret mechanism behind all evil. It's hard to describe, but we all know this state quite well.

It's the same thing that's happening when you feel contempt for those very people — or, indeed, perceive them as (fundamentally) bad in the first place. This sentiment feels totally righteous; like it's there to help you _fight_ their evil. But this is a sinister lie. Contempt (for people) exists **only** to shield you from what your subconscious is secretly doing: preparing to justify behaviors that will elevate or otherwise enrich you at the world's expense — and make you feel _good_ about it.

I cannot convince you of this, for precisely the same reason that you cannot force the "bad people" to confront what they are doing: the more aggressively you try, the harder their mind will shield it from them — and thus the more "evil" they will appear to you. Now for the kicker: _this isn't by accident._ It's not just an unfortunate side-effect of your otherwise noble intentions, like your mind tries to make you believe. _It's secretly the whole point._

Something in us delights in shoving the "bad people" further into the abyss, but it cannot make this too obvious, so it comes up with a fiendish plan. It alters our very perception, so that we don't see a fellow human in the grip of a terrible mechanism that we ourselves share — indeed, that is controlling our minds _at this very moment_. No, we see someone who is _fundamentally defective_; totally unlike us. They therefore cannot be helped; they must be punished.

This part of you knows that by simply harboring this malevolent intention, you will appear to _them_ as fundamentally defective — because their subconscious recognizes that you're in the grip of self-deception. Far from seeing you as someone with the moral authority to be judging them, they will perceive you as someone who needs to be put in your place; someone for whom harm is justified. You will in turn take this as proof of their defectiveness, closing the loop on the sinister plot.

Before we continue, let's pause to appreciate the elegant beauty of this ploy. You didn't have to do anything overtly evil. All that was required was to _harbor a dark intention_. That's what contempt *is*. This is something that is easy to lie to yourself about, and even easier to hide from others — at least, consciously. But we are all subconsciously sensitive to it, which is what allows it to work.

But we're only scratching the surface of the true depths of the horror.

This is all enabled by a kind of mind-virus. The Buddhists know it as the _ego_, and it's also commonly depicted as the devil on your shoulder. It is the thing in you that needs you to be _special_; to elevate yourself above the world somehow. In some people, it manifests as a desire for wealth; in others, the need to look and feel like a "good person."

However it manifests, it will achieve its aim in one way or another — even if it requires stomping on others. For the "bad people," this is straightforward: it just needs to convince them that harming people is okay. For the "good people," it is a bit trickier. We know that cruelty is generally wrong, so we need to be clever about it. We thus divide the world into (fundamentally) good and bad people; those who deserve our compassion and those who do not. The latter are worthy of harm.

Despite our differences, there is one thing all of our devils have in common: whenever we obey their seductive voices, we induce others to do the same. The "greedy banker" _invites_ our contempt; we accept this invitation by nastily judging them for it, which just convinces them that the idiots they're harming deserve it, which convinces us that... etc. They get to have more wealth, and we get to feel more self-righteous. Win-win.

Our devils are _always_ subconsciously coordinating like this. In fact, they're not really independent. From a certain perspective, they behave more like outgrowths of a single malevolent distributed entity: the _Devil_, if you will. **This is the hardest thing to describe, but the most important thing for humanity to become aware of.** We are all harboring a piece of our true nemesis, and protecting it to the death.

This "dark entity" continually drives humanity toward various kinds of Armageddon: situations in which everyone is violently defeating the evil "others." It is why the US is headed toward civil war without anyone suspecting their own complicity, and explains bitter [divorces](https://www.gottman.com/blog/this-one-thing-is-the-biggest-predictor-of-divorce/) in which each side feels like the exclusive victim / hero. Nearly the whole world is caught in its terrible sway, evil provoking "righteous" retribution at every turn, without anyone ever noticing the true source of it all.

You know how people sometimes suspect that there's an "evil global conspiracy" lurking in the shadows, secretly running the show behind the scenes? They are not crazy. _This_ is what they are subconsciously sensing. 

To be clear: there are certainly groups of especially-infected people who conspire to cause great harm, but even they are ultimately subordinate to the _primordial_ conspiracy; one that we are _all_ secretly members of. Every time we feel malice, contempt, or even self-righteousness toward _anyone_; every single time we are unkind, we are strengthening the Beast; reinforcing the conditions that effectively _compel_ the existence of our enemies. And the craziest thing is that _part of us already knows this._

It is impossible to overstate the shock of discovering, for the first time, that you have _always_ been in on the "evil global conspiracy." It is terrifying, heartbreaking, and humbling all at once. We realize all at once what utter hypocrites we are; that we have no leg to stand on if we're still contemptuously judging others.

I keep using the word "subconscious" to describe this behavior, but that's not quite accurate. **It is completely accessible to consciousness, if you know how to look.**

[//]: # (If we suddenly became consciously aware that we've been creating more evil, we would go insane from the shock of discovering our hypocrisy.  )

There is a self-deception mechanism in our minds that actively prevents us from consciously acknowledging the full implications of our words and behaviors. When you perceive someone as "bad," this is what you are recognizing in them. Part of them knows perfectly well when what they are doing is wrong, but the "wrongness" is carefully hidden from conscious self-reflection.

If you then feel contempt for them, then it is your _own_ self-deception that you are experiencing. That sentiment exists only to shield you from discovering what your subconscious is secretly doing: preparing to justify some behavior that will elevate or otherwise enrich you at the world's expense — and make you feel _righteous_ about it. It is exactly what you blame others for.

The way this works is fiendishly clever. When you feel contempt for your enemies, they can subconsciously perceive the self-deception operating in you, even though you consciously cannot. This makes you appear "bad" to them for _precisely_ the same reason they do to you. So now they feel even _more_ justified in their behavior, which in turn makes you feel more justified in yours.

This isn't an accident. Our self-deception is enabled by a kind of parasite in the mind, classically depicted as a devil on our shoulder. It knows how other people's devils behave, because theirs are fundamentally identical. Yours _knew_ how theirs would respond to contempt, and it wanted this, because it _strengthens_ theirs. Your devils are not enemies: they are _allies_. They _planned_ this.

In fact, from a certain perspective, our devils behave more like limbs of a single distributed malevolent entity: _the Devil_, if you will. Its behavior is too clever for words, but I have to try.

You know how people sometimes suspect that there's an "evil global conspiracy" lurking in the shadows, running the show behind the scenes? They are not crazy. They are subconsciously sensing something genuine: there is indeed an aspect of all of our minds communicating with itself beneath our conscious thresholds, shielding itself from discovery in _insanely_ clever ways. 

This "dark entity" continually drives humanity toward various kinds of Armageddon: situations in which everyone is violently proving just how good they are. It is why the US is headed toward civil war without anyone suspecting their own complicity, and explains bitter [divorces](https://www.gottman.com/blog/this-one-thing-is-the-biggest-predictor-of-divorce/) in which each side feels like the exclusive victim / hero. Nearly the whole world is caught in its terrible sway, evil provoking "righteous" retribution at every turn, without anyone ever noticing the true source of it all.

Its greatest trick is to prevent us from suspecting, let alone detecting, our own role in keeping it alive. We only ever see the aspects of it that live "out there," which we then feel compelled to violently attack — but this just makes it stronger. We never notice that it is the aspect "in here" that initiated this perception and behavior in the first place. We are tilting at windmills. Any time we feel contempt, malice, or even self-righteousness toward _anybody,_ we are just feeding the Beast.

It's not that we're _not_ supposed to fight the evil out there. But to the degree that we are not yet free of our own self-deception, we are only capable of strengthening it in others. We pat ourselves on the back for "fighting evil" and then lament the increasingly sorry state of the world — which we then must "unfortunately" fight even harder. We never suspect that something within us _wants_ this.

It is what the Buddhists know as the "ego" — the part of us that needs to feel special. For some people this may be about accumulating wealth, and in others it is about being "good people." It makes us perceive other people in whatever way necessary to justify behavior that will bolster our self-image. For "good people," our subconscious is on the prowl for anyone we can plausibly see as "bad," so that we can make them _worse_ — via behaviors that appear righteous on the surface.

To be clear: there are surely groups of particularly "endarkened" people who consciously conspire to cause great harm, and **we must hold such people accountable** — but when we do so with contempt, we are secretly (and on a subconscious level, _knowingly_) reinforcing the very conditions that effectively compel their existence. All such "conspiracies" ultimately filter up to the primordial conspiracy that we ourselves are members of. They cannot be defeated without our seeing this.

This is not just a wacky theory or

If you manage to take your own egoic mechanism offline for even a moment, it feels exactly like you'd imagine feeling if you were suddenly freed from a demonic possession. You clearly perceive how this "demon" has very cleverly commandeered people's minds.

Seeing this all clearly turns your whole world upside-down. We are hating people for their susceptibility to the world's most fiendish mind-virus — the one responsible for our very hatred. And this hatred exists for no other reason than to push them further _into_ its evil clutches.

(To be fair, there does seem to be a tiny percentage of people who have consciously welcomed the demon in, for whom the description "evil" really does capture something important. Such people pose a unique challenge. Being "kind" to them in the conventional sense can indeed be dangerous. And yet the very _deepest_ aspect of their mind does not want it. Again, it is only once you see exactly what "it" is that you understand why _nobody_ ultimately could. Think of it like a form of Stockholm syndrome. If you want to defeat evil, you must want them to be free of it, too.)

What lies beneath the ego is something like a boundless love for all of reality. You see that you aren't really fundamentally separate from it. Any harm you cause to the world is ultimately done to yourself. The recognition of this "absolute good" within is what slowly brings the process of self-deception to an end.

This "absolute good" is something that we cannot take any credit for. Instead, we can only feel profound gratitude for whatever grace allowed us to discover it, and heartbreak that it still remains so deeply hidden in others. The hardest part is watching the whole world being casually cruel to each other, unaware of which "team" they are secretly fighting for. It inspires a fierce determination to end the "possession" that has captured people's minds, instead of deepening it like we've unwittingly been doing. We clearly see the face of our true nemesis for the first time.

This doesn't mean that you will suddenly become nice or lovey-dovey toward evildoers. You may still need to be fierce, or perhaps even violent[^dalai-lama-gun]. Mockery, shaming, or even _apparent_ contempt might still be useful tools in your arsenal. But these will be in the service of _freeing_ people from the darkness, not pushing them further in. It is a kind of "tough love," and feels _nothing_ like the self-righteous antagonism that we normally feel when "fighting evil." You are still "connected to your heart." **That is what is most crucial.** Others can sense the profoundly benevolent intent (even if only subconsciously), and it makes _all the difference in the world_.

---

In every interaction you have two options: to either encourage the Light in others, or to fight their darkness with yours. Again: **encouraging their Light has nothing to do with being _nice_**. It is about being completely unwilling to abandon your own Light under _any circumstances_ — including the one that their darkness is presently testing you with. Their darkness is looking for a "hook" in your mind that it can use to justify itself — some sign that even you, the "good person," are weak to its seduction. If you refuse to abandon your integrity even then, the fierceness of your Light subjugates their darkness. They subconsciously remember that _the Light_ isn't just a myth.

This is authentic kindness (aka compassion). It is "radical" for two reasons. First, it contradicts our usual intuition that some people "deserve" it while others don't. It could never be the case that some people deserve to be shoved further into the abyss while others deserve to be freed from it. Second, it need not look anything like "kindness" in the conventional sense (though most often, it will). It certainly doesn't have to be soft or weak.

I know it feels like some people don't _have_ an inner Light to encourage, but this is just an illusion that our darkness uses to get its foot in the door. By the time it has tricked us into dividing the world into fundamentally "good" and "bad" people — which feels like the most natural thing in the world — it has already infected the deepest aspect of our minds. Then, it can bide its time fostering conditions that will get us to commit unspeakable horror in the name of "good."[^genocide]

> Be kind, ...

There are two ways to understand this aphorism. The first goes something like this: 

> Be _nice_, because _most_ people are fighting a great battle. Some people, however, are just bad. They're _willfully_ misbehaving, and not due to any 'great battle.' They don't deserve kindness.

The second understanding is much more profound.

Imagine a mind-virus that could infect your mind so deeply that it appeared to _be_ you. This way, other people would never detect that you were fighting a battle at all. They would perceive you as someone worthy only of contempt; someone to hate, which would just drive the virus _deeper_. Meanwhile, your "true self" would be crying out for help from inside a tiny box, locked away so deeply that the bulk of your mind couldn't even remember that it existed.

This story is not far from the truth. This virus exists, and we call the infected people "evil."

If you think I'm suggesting that we be _nice_ to them, think again. The virus is far too clever to be defeated by such a naive strategy. But being cruel is even worse — and the reason why is even more shocking: _we ourselves are infected._ Our contempt for other people is only ever initiated by our virus, and its only purpose is to _strengthen_ theirs. **Our viruses are secretly coordinating.** We are all pawns in a game that most of us don't even realize we're playing.

Our infection may not be as deep as the "bad" people's — yet. We still retain some semblance of our "true selves"; the part that could never want to cause harm. But the virus is operating within us at all times, always subtly manipulating our perceptions, biding its time so that it can burrow deeper.

True kindness isn't about being nice. It's about recognizing this fiendish foe that we all face, and doing what we can to help each other defeat it — instead of being tricked into empowering it like we have been.

Let's win this fight. It's the only one that ultimately matters.

"Compassion" may be the most deeply misunderstood word in the English language. We think it has something to do with being gentle or nice. Compassion for evildoers seems naive and even dangerous — what good could come from empathizing with someone so despicable?

But the truth is that part of your mind _already_ empathizes with them, in a certain sense. From their perspective, what they're doing makes total sense. When you rediscover the aspect of your mind that sees this, all contemptuous judgement ceases, and something radically different takes its place.

There is an aspect of every person's mind that only wants the best for others and the world. This can be very hard to believe. It may even sound like a naive religious belief. But there is a way that you can see it for yourself. How?

First, you must find the part of _your own mind_ that only wants the best for the world. You may think that this is already obvious; that it is your normal state, but there's a simple way to tell if this is true. Are you able to feel contempt for _anyone_? How about the [...]

If you answered "yes," you probably believe that the contempt is there to _help_ the world in some way. This is a vicious lie. That's not something I can convince you of, but it is _also_ something that you can confirm for yourself.

The truth is that contempt exists _only_ to elevate or otherwise enrich yourself at the world's expense. You don't hate people to make the world better; you do it to make yourself feel superior. If you could inspect your subconscious while you are feeling this way, you would discover

Any time you feel contempt for _anyone_ for _any reason_, your subconscious is secretly plotting to elevate or otherwise enrich yourself at the world's expense — to harm the world and profit from it.

Your hatred of the "bad people" isn't there to help you fight evil; it's there to help you push them _further_ into the dark while feeling righteous about it. Whatever you do to "own" them — no matter how respectable you try to make it seem — _will_ make the world a darker place, even as you gloat about it.

This is _insanely difficult_ to admit to oneself, for obvious reasons — but it is not until you see precisely _why_ it is so difficult to admit (and begin to undo it) that you begin to consciously appreciate what makes it so hard for the "bad people" to realize what _they_ are doing.

I say "consciously" because your subconscious already knows it. It knows that if you were them, you would behave (more or less) exactly as they do. From their perspective, what they are doing makes total sense — and it is possible to _enter_ their perspective while still being you. When this happens, you wish for only one thing: to undo the bizarre contortions of mind that have resulted in them thinking that this is okay.

This isn't a condescending perspective, nor one that tolerates (let alone condones) misbehavior. But it is also not one in which contempt or malice are remotely possible. If you were a neurosurgeon, would you hate or judge people for the tumor you're removing from their brains? It's not a perfect analogy, but captures something of the taste.

There is a deep part of people that doesn't want to be doing wrong, but this is impossible to see or appreciate until you find the part of yourself that could never, ever feel contempt for anyone. In every interaction with people (in fact, in every action whatsoever), you are either helping people out of the abyss or shoving them further into it. If you want to end the "bad" in the world, you must help people remember that _they_ want to pull others out — and you cannot do this until you yourself remember how to pull _them_ out.

There are so many people in the world for whom it is natural to feel contempt — the hypocrites; the downright evil; the aggressively stupid; the willfully ignorant — and there seem to be more by the day. We probably know that we're not "supposed" to feel contempt, but that seems like an unreasonable and increasingly outmoded religious idea. How _else_ are we supposed to deal with such despicable people?

The truth is that we don't actually feel contempt to help anyone or anything: that's just a story we tell ourselves to maintain our self-image. We do it for a much less noble reason; one that will take a minute to unpack.

If you could actually see other people's minds in their full complexity, you would discover that the very deepest aspect of them doesn't — indeed _couldn't_ — want to be any of the aforementioned things. Certainly _some_ part of them does — and that's the part we imagine we're directing our contempt at. But what happens is that their defense mechanisms just kick in and intercept our attack, causing them to dig in their heels. We then get to feel contempt for this incorrigibility, too.

What we can't see — or admit — is that our behavior was subconsciously _designed_ to trigger those very defense mechanisms _so that_ we could feel licensed to escalate our disdain. We _want_ "bad people" to get worse, so that we can continue to gloat over them. It doesn't matter how "bad" someone is, or in what sense they are "bad": contempt is _only ever_ designed to trigger this reaction for the sake of our egos.

With training, it is actually possible to see — and communicate with — the part of people that doesn't want to be deplorable; the very deepest aspect of their minds. This is called _compassion,_ and it is profoundly misunderstood. It doesn't mean being _nice._ Such "communication" may _look_ like contempt — or even violence — from the outside, but feels nothing like it from the inside. The recipient can sense the profoundly benevolent intent (even if only subconsciously), and it makes _all the difference in the world._ This may not be immediately evident — and it doesn't provide us with the satisfying hit of self-righteousness that actual contempt does — but it is of genuine benefit.

Do it to hide our similarity.

It is why our faith in humanity is restored when we witness acts of kindness, and why we sometimes thank others for being generous with strangers even when no (apparent) benefit comes to us. It is why certain literature speaks to us so deeply, despite making very little _rational_ sense.

[^child]: Not that there will be familial love, or indeed "love" in the conventional sense of the word.

Pause and reflect on what's wrong with the world, and bring to mind the people responsible — the "bad people." Don't they know that they're being evil — and if they don't, then _shouldn't_ they? Either way, they seem fundamentally morally defective and thus deserving of contempt.

Now think back to a time when you skirted your conscience, either by pretending you couldn't hear it or that it was safe to ignore it. We've all done this. Try to recall what it was like. Part of you _knew_ you were doing wrong, but the _wrongness_ was carefully hidden from conscious self-reflection. It is a kind of self-deception — and it is precisely the same mechanism that enables the "bad people" to do what _they_ do. Theirs may be much more extreme, but it works on the same principle.

It turns out that _contempt_ can only be generated from within this state. Why?

The reason that "bad people" need to rely on self-deception is that some part of them _doesn't want to be doing wrong._ This means that they are not "fundamentally" morally defective. They are far more like us than we are willing to admit.

Something in your mind is actively shielding you from seeing this. It does this by making you feel contempt — a toxic emotion that you would otherwise never feel. That in turn causes you to act in ways that provoke your target into doing things that justify your contempt, thus licensing more righteous wrath — the most delicious feeling of all.

When you do this, others can tell — even if only subconsciously, and even if you cannot — that you are acting maliciously, and not for the benefit of the world. This appears evil to them for precisely the same reason that they do to you. They know that you are trying to push them further into the dark and calling this "righteous." They thus perceive you as someone lacking the moral authority to be scornfully judging anyone, and feel the urge to put you in _your_ place.

Part of you _knew_ this would happen, and _wanted_ it, because it "proves" that you were right about them. After all, any decent person would have simply repented in the face of such noble fury.

Contempt is a self-reinforcing delusion whose only purpose is to prevent you from discovering our shared humanity, by encouraging others not to. It is a way to keep people trapped in darkness while feeling good about it. It is _evil._ Full stop.

This can be incredibly difficult to admit to ourselves, but it's also necessary. If we don't see this, it means that we're still immersed in self-deception — and in this state, we cannot _reduce_ the self-deception of others; we can only amplify it. In other words, we can only inspire more evil, despite what we may consciously tell ourselves.

Perhaps MLK said it best:

> *Darkness cannot drive out darkness; only light can do that. Hate cannot drive out hate; only love can do that.*

Evil is not actually a _presence_ (like it seems), but an _absence_. The absence of what? Of the perception of the profound interconnectedness of all life. This absence cannot be "extinguished"; it can only be dispelled through illumination. This may sound like spiritual mumbo-jumbo, but part of you knows exactly what I mean. Everything comes down to remembering this. The more you do, the more you remember how to banish evil.

This is called _compassion_ (or what MLK called "love") — but it doesn't mean being _nice_ or lovey-dovey. Sometimes it must be fierce, or perhaps even violent, as we will later see.

Although evil is an absence, there _is_ a terrifying way in which it behaves like a presence.

This feeling is a lie. Part of you knows that you are not "fundamentally" better than anyone. Contempt exists only to maintain this lie: it causes you to provoke them into behaving in ways that _prove_ their "badness," thus licensing even more contempt. That is its _only_ purpose.

This behavior makes the world darker — something a "good person" isn't supposed to do. So your subconscious hides this fact from you, making you perceive your behavior as _righteous._ Any increased darkness can be blamed entirely on them. This is a form of self-deception.

It turns out that self-deception is also how the "bad people" are able to do what _they_ do without remorse. They know perfectly well when what they are doing is wrong, but the _wrongness_ is cleverly hidden from conscious self-reflection.

This wouldn't be necessary unless _some_ part of them didn't want to be doing it. Consciously, you may not believe this, but subconsciously, you can perceive it. But now you're in an even bigger pickle: your attempt to prove how different you were just proves how similar you are.

---
---

Something deep within us knows that there's no _intrinsic_ difference between us and them; that we ourselves are capable of almost anything under the right circumstances. Our subconscious uses contempt to help this fact stay hidden from consciousness. It does its job well, which is why you may not believe me when I say that you already know this.

To take an everyday example: consider what happens when we mock our political opponents. Don't they just dig in their heels, see _us_ as evil, and vow to fight harder? We tell ourselves that we had "good intentions" (to shut them up; force them to introspect; convince others not to join them, etc.), but the truth is that something in us is _trying_ to maintain the polarization.

This ultimately harms the world, and part of us knows it. But "good people" don't do such things, and so we must hide this fact from consciousness. But wait a minute: what if the "bad people" are doing exactly the same thing? What if they're hiding _their_ misbehavior from conscious self-reflection, too — which would only be necessary if there's some part of them that doesn't want to be doing it, which means that... oh, sh*t, maybe our cruelty isn't so noble after all. Maybe we're just shoving that part of them further into the abyss. That would be _evil._

It's not that they don't know that what they're doing is wrong. The worst people will even openly _admit_ that it is, and that they enjoy it. But even then, this knowledge must remain cleverly hidden 

I'm not speaking hypothetically. If you look carefully enough at your mind while feeling contempt — and this is _hard_ — you will find that part of you can actually perceive this about people, and is searching for clever ways to gleefully push them further into the dark and then hiding this from yourself, just to bolster your own self-image. Not to put too fine a point on it, but this is _evil_ — and this is true _regardless_ of how bad they are or what they've done.

But you don't do this because you're a "bad person": that very notion is the problem. You do this because of a strange quirk of human psychology — one that is best described in mythopoetic terms.




---

But just pause and reflect on how much more viscerally satisfying it is to watch a bad person "get owned" than to have a change of heart. The latter would rob us of the unspeakably gratifying pleasure of seeing evil get "destroyed."

Our contempt naturally leads to malice, which is a very effective way to help "bad people" stay bad. Even if there is a tiny part of them that wishes to be free of their darkness — a possibility that we flatly refuse to countenance — we ensure that it stays suppressed. In the same way that witnessing acts of kindness can restore your faith in humanity, your malicious intent is (secretly) designed to produce the opposite effect in your target and all others who witness it. Your "allies" will subconsciously reframe this as a "necessary evil," and thus noble.

Keeping people trapped in the dark is hardly the mark of a "good person," and so this drive must remain subconscious.


---
---

Why is it so hard to eradicate evil? Could it be that something within us is secretly fighting to keep it alive?

That might sound absurd to you, or even offensive. Yet it is the truth — and without seeing this clearly, we have no hope of winning the fight.

---

When you think about the "bad people" of the world — whoever they are — it's hard not to feel at least a little contempt. But this emotion isn't merely counterproductive: it's a sign of something much darker.

If you look carefully enough into your mind while you are feeling contempt, you will discover that something in you is secretly plotting a way to create _more hostility_ in the world. Of course, it will not tell you this: instead, you will feel like you are doing something _righteous._

To take a simple example, consider what happens when we mock our political opponents. Don't they just dig in their heels, see _us_ as evil, and vow to fight harder? We tell ourselves that we had "good intentions" (to shut them up; force them to introspect; convince others not to join them, etc.), but the truth is that something in us _wants_ more polarization, because it allows us to feel self-righteous — as delicious a feeling as they come.

As a more extreme example, didn't the architects of the "War on Terror" _know_ that indiscriminately bombing the sh*t out of people would just inspire a new wave of "terrorists" who they would then "unfortunately" have to destroy too? The answer is both yes and no: a part of them certainly knew, but they were only able to justify it to themselves by shielding the immense _wrongness_ from conscious self-reflection; from the part of them that would put an end to it if forced to confront it.

We can see this in their eyes when they speak: they are clearly lying through their teeth when they pretend they did it for noble reasons. But if this inspires contempt in you, then what you're not seeing is that _your eyes are taking on precisely the same look!_

It is completely inevitable: any time you feel contempt, your mind is secretly trying to increase the enmity in the world while finding a way to convince you that it is good — and it _will_ find a way.

---
---

When you think about the "bad people," you probably can't help but feel intrinsically superior to them. They seem _fundamentally morally defective_, quite unlike you.

Yet there is a sense in which you are _not_ fundamentally different (which we will get to soon), and there is a part of you that _knows_ this. It knows that your self-righteousness is ultimately baseless. But it also knows that you don't want to see this, and so to hide it from you, it does something very clever: it provokes more evil in them, to reassure you of how different they are.

How? It's really clever: simply by feeling self-righteous, you appear like a "bad person" to them. Think about it: if someone self-righteously puts you in your place (whether you deserve it or not), do they appear _noble_ to you? Of course not. They look like pompous jerks who need to be put in _their_ place. Contempt looks slightly evil — whether it comes from a "good person" or a "bad person" — and people tend to respond to it as such.

We may try to hide our contempt, but part of us is actually making sure they feel it. When this is met with a predictably unhealthy response, we tell ourselves that we're simply exposing evil that was already there. We refuse to recognize our role in _provoking_ it; something we are astonishingly good at, though we probably don't realize it.

As I said, part of us _does_ realize it, but that part is hiding this fact from our consciousness. Why? Because if we knew we were provoking evil, it would destroy our self-image as "good people." This is a form of self-deception, which turns out to be precisely the mechanism that enables the "bad people" to do what _they_ do. Part of them knows perfectly well that they're doing wrong, but that knowledge is carefully shielded from conscious self-reflection.

If you really want to stop them, you have to force them to own up to their self-deception. Yet if you try to use "force," you will only end up looking self-righteous, because that is how you _feel_.

The solution is simple (though far from easy): you must discover the full extent of your own self-deception, starting with your hidden desire to provoke evil in others. The more you see this, the more clear it becomes that you're not _fundamentally_ unlike them. This is not something I can describe to you unless you've already seen it. But the more you do, the less possible it is to feel contempt.

The more completely you have done so,

That might sound absurd to you, or even offensive. Yet it is the truth — and without seeing this clearly, we have no hope of winning the fight.

Let's start with an obvious example: why do we enjoy mocking our political opponents? The first thing to acknowledge is that we _do_ enjoy it. We can come up with numerous reasons why it's helpful (it shuts them up; it forces them to introspect; it convinces others not to join them, etc.), but there's a much darker reason for our enjoyment.

Part of us knows that it will lead to increased polarization, and we _want_ this. Why? Because there is something uniquely gratifying about violently defeating evil — and the more clearly we highlight theirs, the exponentially more satisfying it will be when we finally extinguish it once and for all. We need their evil to be unmistakable so that we can feel completely righteous about the profound violence that we intend to visit upon it.

Part of us believes that we are merely honing in on the evil that is already there, but another part of us knows that we are also _provoking_ it. We may believe that such provocation wouldn't work if they had any decency, and so the fact that it _does_ is proof that they are intrinsically bad — but we don't realize just how outrageously clever we are at pushing people's buttons. Something in us _needs_ people to be fundamentally broken, and will stop at nothing to "prove" it.

We may be aware of this dark tendency in ourselves, and evey try to avoid it, but it goes far deeper than we realize. And mockery is far from the only tool that we use: any time we perceive someone as _fundamentally morally defective_ — evil, in short — _something_ about our behavior will be secretly designed to provoke it, whether we are conscious of this or not. It is completely inevitable. It might be as subtle as stoking outrage in others, to lay the groundwork for future action.

So what's the solution then? To just let evil win? No. The trick is to understand how it works.

We've all had the experience of skirting our conscience, either by pretending that we couldn't hear it, or that we could safely ignore it. Try to remember what that state is like. It is a kind of self-deception. This is the secret mechanism behind _all the evil there ever was._ People know perfectly well when they're doing something wrong, but the _wrongness_ is carefully shielded from conscious self-reflection. 

Their subconscious shielding is so clever that it convinces us (and often even them) that _no_ part of them knows — which could only mean that they are, indeed, fundamentally defective. Thus begins our righteous assault.

Here's the thing: as we saw, our attack is surreptitiously designed to provoke more evil. If you inspect your mind carefully enough while this is happening — and this is hard — you'll discover a horrifying truth: that part of you _knows_ this is wrong, but you are carefully shielding this fact from yourself. In other words, you are being self-deceptive — and this will make _you_ appear evil in _their_ eyes. And this isn't by accident: it is precisely what enables your provocation to work. Of _course_ they are going to react poorly to what they perceive as evil! This was the secret plan all along!

This can be extremely hard to admit to ourselves, for obvious reasons. But until we do, we can never understand what drives other people's evil, and are thus incapable of healing it. 

Our behavior isn't nearly as bad as that of people who commit atrocities — and our self-deception is correspondingly much weaker. Yet despite this, we _still_ struggle to confront it. It is always painful to discover that we've been deceiving ourselves, and this is only _more_ true for the "bad people." That's what prevents them from confronting the full wrongness. We think that their misbehavior should be _more_ obvious to them, but we've got it exactly backward — and we are _motivated_ to.

If you want the "bad people" to confront their misbehavior — which is the only way to end it — you _must_ understand how their self-deception works. This is not an intellectual thing that you can get from a book. It requires seeing how it operates in your own mind. You will know you've succeeded when you stop seeing "evil people," and no longer feel even a trace of malice or self-righteousness toward anyone. These are unmistakable signs that it is still operating in you.

---

If you had instead perceived them not as "fundamentally defective" but as engaged in profound self-deception — which is the truth — then you would have behaved very differently. You might still have leveraged mockery (or perhaps even violence), but there would have been no trace of self-righteousness to it — and others can subconsciously detect this. It prevents their "evil" from finding the hook that it needs to justify itself.



There is obviously something very different about what we are doing and what the "evil people" are, but there is also something very much the same — and as long as we harbor that part of ourselves, we are always at risk of becoming them, whether like to admit this or not.

[^armageddon] We also know that this "Armageddon" that we are trying to provoke — the day when our Good violently prevails over their Evil — will not lead to lasting peace. It is just another form of escalation itself.


---
---

What if nearly everything you're doing to "fight evil" is actually strengthening it — and moreover, what if part of you already knows this, but is carefully hiding it from your conscious mind? What if the difficulty admitting this to yourself is caused by precisely the same mechanism that prevents the "bad people" from fully realizing what _they_ are doing?

These are provocative questions, but they point at an astonishing truth. The Devil hides in the very last place you would ever look.

---
---

Why is it so hard to eradicate evil? What if the tools we've been using to fight it are secretly weapons _of_ it?

Take a moment to think about what's "wrong with the world" and bring to mind the people responsible. Do this until you can really feel some animosity. They obviously know that what they're doing is wrong, and deserve to be punished for it.

We all know that we're not "supposed" to hate people (even bad ones), and that it's "right" to show them compassion. But these admonishments have little impact on us until we see exactly _why._ There's something truly astonishing to see here.

When you feel animosity, your mind is secretly gearing up to harm the world in some way that you won't consciously recognize as harmful. A simple example is when we mock our political opponents. We may describe it as "fighting evil," but part of us knows that we're only doing it to provoke them into behavior that will justify even more mockery — or worse.

It's not that mockery has no place in the fight against evil. Sometimes it may indeed be a helpful tool. But when we wield it with animosity, we're not actually _trying_ to help anyone — certainly not them, but not even the world. We're just justifying our vengeful instincts by dressing them up as righteous. This may be a hard pill to swallow, but it's crucial that we see this clearly.

There is a bizarre state that our minds occupy, in which we hide our true intentions from even ourselves. We know perfectly well that what we're doing is wrong, but that _wrongness_ is carefully hidden from conscious self-reflection. This is precisely the state that the "bad people" are in, and until we see clearly how it operates in ourselves, we have no hope of defeating the evil "out there."

This state is caused by a kind of mind-virus, and an especially clever one. It makes us do its bidding without ever realizing that we are infected. One of its greatest tricks is to make us search for other "infectees" and then behave in ways that will _deepen_ their infection: we find the "bad people" and then provoke them into becoming _worse._ The way this works is fascinating.

By activating our malice, it makes us appear evil to them (and to everyone else, whether they are consciously aware of it or not. Our "allies" are mostly not, for obvious reasons). This serves as a signal to _their_ viruses that we too are infected. The parasites then perform a kind of "secret handshake," in which they agree to empower each other while convincing their hosts that they are fighting.

Think back to the "mocking your political opponents" example. Consciously, you feel like enemies, but if you introspect carefully enough, you'll find that your darkness is secretly _allied_ with theirs. Your parasites have a common goal: to increase the animosity in the world, while convincing you that this is _righteous_ and _necessary_. Evil never actually _fights_ evil; it is always on the same team.

If you zoom out, you wil discover that _all_ of our parasites are secretly allied in this way. In fact, if you are perceptive enough, you will notice that they behave more like outgrowths of a single malevolent "distributed organism" that is manipulating _all_ of our minds. This isn't some abstract theory: as best I can tell, everyone who pays careful enough attention eventually discovers this.

Every time you feel hatred, malice, contempt, or even just self-righteousness, you are secretly feeding the Beast. It is completely inevitable. If you think you've found an exception — some uniquely evil person who _requires_ your malice — it just means that you are being manipulated especially hard. Alas, I won't be able to talk you out of it any more than you can simply talk them out of _their_ infection.

Even before you feel malice, there is an easy way to detect your infection. If you perceive the world as being comprised by "good people" and "bad people," the parasite has already accomplished most of its work. There is no actually dividing line; there are only those of us who are presently more and less infected. 

---


This doesn't mean we're "bad people." In fact, the very root of the problem is dividing the world into "good people" and "bad people"; those who deserve our compassion and those who deserve our animosity. That division exists for only one purpose: to provide you with people who it feels _right_ to mistreat.

In the same way that we dress up certain misbehavior as "righteous," the "bad people" do too. It is a kind of self-deception, and everything comes down to seeing how it works. 


---
---

People are only able to misbehave while under the sway of a particular mind-virus. People who are frequently under its sway we call "bad people," and those who are most deeply infected we call "evil people."

You are infected by this virus, too. It's mostly dormant, but it gets triggered when you encounter "bad people." It makes you want to be cruel to them — even if it's just light cruelty, such as mocking.

You may think that there's nothing wrong with mocking bad people, but that's the whole point: while under the sway of the virus, you never feel like you are. Misbehavior somehow just feels... _right._ That's why the "bad people" are able to do what they do.

Part of you knows perfectly well that you don't mock your enemies to help them "see the light," but mostly to provoke them into behaving in ways that will justify more mockery... or worse. But it is _so hard_ to admit this to yourself while you're doing it. It feels so convincingly like you're "fighting evil."

While possessed by the virus, there is always a part of you that _knows_ — but that part gets smaller and smaller the worse the infection gets. Even in "evil people," there is a tiny part that knows — their "inner light," so to speak — but this part is very hard for them to access.

We cannot tell when we are under the sway of our virus, but other people can. In fact, we _want_ them to. Why? Because the same way that other infected people look "evil" to us, we look (slightly) evil to others while in its grip. That's what makes mocking our enemies so effective: they feel like they're being judged by a _bad person,_ which is something they won't tolerate. Who would?

If you look carefully, you will discover that the desire to be cruel to "evil people" is secretly a desire to push their "inner light" deeper into the abyss; to deepen their infection. This is _malevolent._ That doesn't make you a "bad person" — if I thought so, I'd just be making the same mistake. What's happening is that their virus is triggering yours, as if through resonance.

If you "listen" carefully, you can hear all of our viruses resonating together. It is like a background hum of evil. At any given moment, mine is ready to trigger yours, and vice versa. They only need the right conditions.


To be clear, it's not that mockery is always wrong. Sometimes it can be a helpful tool.

---

What is the best way to fight evil? The obvious answer is to find the "evil people" and defeat them, but there is a very good reason that this plan hasn't been working: it's actually not meant to.

Evil behaves like a parasite that infects people's minds and alters their very perception. It makes the "infectee" see certain other people as subhuman, and thus fair game for cruelty. They know perfectly well that this is wrong at _some_ level, but the parasite cleverly shields that "wrongness" from conscious self-reflection. It is a form of self-deception.

We are all familiar with this schism of mind. We've all had the experience of skirting our conscience, either by pretending that we couldn't hear it, or that we could get away with overriding it. It is a kind of self-deception, and it is precisely this mechanism that enables _all_ evil.

When the parasite infects someone who considers themselves a "good person" — like you or me — it does something especially clever: the "certain other people" who it makes look subhuman are the "bad people." Think about it: doesn't it feel positively _righteous_ to treat those people with cruelty? It may be hard to admit this to yourself, but part of you knows that this is a dangerous lie.

When we viciously attack a "bad person," part of them can sense that we are under the sway of exactly the same parasite that they are. Therefore, we have no moral authority by which to judge them. So, far from simply repenting, they now see _us_ as evil, and include us in their group of "people who deserve cruelty." We take this as confirmation that they, likewise, belong in _ours._

This plan _can't_ work to end evil, because it was designed by the parasite _not_ to work. On the contrary, it is specifically designed to _strengthen_ the grip of the parasite in all of our minds — and it is working astonishingly well. Somehow, after thousands of years, we haven't caught on to its trick.

So is the solution to _not_ fight "evil people"? Not exactly. The trick is to see that there _are_ no "evil people"; only people who are more and less infected by the parasite. Once you see this — really _see_, and not just _believe_ — you no longer feel like you are fighting _people_. You are only ever fighting the parasite that has infected _all_ of our minds.

Sometimes, fighting the parasite certainly takes the _form_ of fighting people. So then what's the difference? You never feel _malice_, the sinister pleasure of watching people be harmed. You're not gleefully shoving the "bad people" further into the dark, like you were when under the sway of your parasite. You feel no _self-righteousness_; the sense that you are fundamentally better than anyone else. You can now see clearly that you are not; that this idea has **always** been the parasite talking.

This is called _compassion,_ and other people can sense it. There is no particular form that it must take. It can be fierce or even violent if necessary. But your fundamental benevolence prevents their parasites from using your evil as justification to further infect their minds. This makes **all** the difference in the world. It is the only way to actually fight evil instead of unwittingly spreading it.

That is why the fight against evil _must_ begin with doing everything in your power to find and evict the parasite that has secretly commandeered your mind.




---

There is something uniquely pleasurable about violently punishing evil, so our subconscious does something very clever: it seeks out "evil people" and then makes us behave in ways that provoke them, so that we feel licensed to escalate our righteous wrath. Part of us would be disappointed if they were to instead "see the light" and repent — even though that would be far better for the world. It is more satisfying to watch them suffer.

The really clever part is _how_ we provoke them. The mere _intention_ to provoke evil is itself evil — and their subconscious can sense this. It makes them perceive _us_ as evil, which they then feel compelled to fight. But because we are convinced that we are behaving righteously, we take this as confirmation that they are indeed evil — precisely what we needed to license escalation.

Our subconscious secretly orchestrated this, but it hid the plan from our conscious minds. This is self-deception. As it turns out, this is precisely the mechanism behind _all_ forms of evil: people know perfectly well when what they are doing is wrong, but the _wrongness_ is carefully hidden from conscious self-reflection.

This behavior is caused by a kind of parasite that lives in our minds. It manipulates our very perception so that we literally _see_ some people as deserving of malice. For you, it is the "bad people" — those who are fundamentally morally defective. But the thing is, they're not _fundamentally_ defective; they're actually under the sway of the very same parasite.

Your parasite is tricking you into overlooking the parasite in others, so that you behave in ways that give _their_ parasite the ammo it needs to trick them into doing the same right back at us. Don't you see? Your parasite and theirs aren't enemies — they are _allies!_ **All** of our parasites are allied, getting us to behave in ways that strengthen each other's at every turn.

This is that secret "evil global conspiracy" that everyone fears exists — and part of it lives within your very own mind. While under its terrible sway, every single thing you do to "fight" evil out there only amplifies it.

Its greatest trick is to convince you that it does not live in your mind, but only "out there." Maybe you think that okay, fine, you have a _tiny_ role to play in the world's ills, but still, the evil people are the real problem. But the truth is, once you are totally free of your parasite, that illusion falls apart — because you now directly perceive their parasites.

We've all had the experience of doing something wrong while convincing ourselves that it's not. What we may not realize is that literally _all_ evil depends on this mechanism of self-deception.

We are motivated not to see this, because it allows us to see ourselves as fundamentally different from the "bad people." And that enables us to harm them without feeling bad about it.

Harming "bad people" gives us the righteous feeling of fighting evil — except that part of us knows that they're not fundamentally different, and that this behavior just makes their minds darker.

This would be painful to admit, but luckily for us, their minds becoming darker just makes us more sure that they are fundamentally bad, licensing us to escalate our violence instead of confronting what we're really doing.



---

It is hard to admit, but there is darkness within each of us. It is not _intrinsic_ to our minds, but is more like a parasite. It knows that we are unwilling to harm people unless we see them as less than human — which most of us know is wrong. So it uses a clever trick: it alters our perception so that we see the darkness as intrinsic to some people's minds. We call them "bad people" and see them as subhuman, so that harming them becomes not just okay, but positively righteous.

Consciously, we don't realize that we're being manipulated; it feels like we're expressing a natural and healthy instinct to violently attack evil — which we now mistakenly equate with attacking the _people_. But no matter how subdued our attack (e.g., mockery), our underlying malicious intent makes us appear evil to them for exactly the same reason that they appear evil to us.

This has the effect of driving their darkness deeper into their minds, making it appear even more surely intrinsic, which inspires even more righteous violence from us, in a downward spiral. We act dismayed by their recalcitrance, but our darkness actually orchestrated this descent. We may not be conscious of this, but our "victim" is certain that we are, again for the same reason that we are sure that _their_ evil is fully volitional.

Our darkness tricks us into behaving in ways that will convince others that ours is intrinsic, because it knows exactly how theirs operates and will respond — _because ours and theirs are identical_. In fact, they are not just identical, but are more like outgrowths of a single shared "shadowy presence" that continually manipulates all of our minds; the _Devil_, if you will.

This is not just a wacky religious idea: it seems that everyone who introspects carefully enough eventually perceives this "distributed malevolent entity" which has a kind of intelligence and volition of its own that, even if not _literally_ true, explain its seemingly-coordinated behavior far more accurately than if ours were independent.

It is the primordial "evil global conspiracy," and it lives in all of our minds. Every attempt to maliciously subdue it "out there" just strengthens it, because such behavior is only ever initiated by it, even though it makes us believe that it was initiated by us. Contempt is its most insidious tool precisely because it appears to be the most unmistakably righteous.

There may well be groups of particularly darkened people who conspire to cause great harm, but their existence wouldn't be possible if the rest of us weren't feeding the source — and conversely, it is _inevitable_ given that we are. **We must hold such people accountable**, but when we do this with contempt, we are injecting more evil into the world. It _will_ find a way to manifest somewhere, though we will disown all complicity for it.

The only way for humanity to defeat the Devil is to stop falling for its tricks. Any time you feel malice, hatred, contempt, or even self-righteousness toward another being; any time you see them as fundamentally defective or inferior; you are being manipulated, and this _will_ create more evil. As you begin to clear up this misperception in your own mind, you discover what is causing it in others'. Only then can you do anything genuinely useful about it.

The topic of what such "useful" behavior looks like is vast and is beyond our scope. Such behavior depends entirely on circumstances, and is impossible to reduce to principles, except for one: the more deeply it is rooted in compassion — i.e., free of the above misperception — the more beneficial it tends to be. Being _entirely_ free is enlightenment; perception of our fundamental unity. (Note that this profound unity is also what allows the Devil to exist.) Rest assured that compassionate action _can_ be outwardly violent.
