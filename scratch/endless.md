Do it to hide our similarity.

It is why our faith in humanity is restored when we witness acts of kindness, and why we sometimes thank others for being generous with strangers even when no (apparent) benefit comes to us. It is why certain literature speaks to us so deeply, despite making very little _rational_ sense.

[^child]: Not that there will be familial love, or indeed "love" in the conventional sense of the word.

Pause and reflect on what's wrong with the world, and bring to mind the people responsible — the "bad people." Don't they know that they're being evil — and if they don't, then _shouldn't_ they? Either way, they seem fundamentally morally defective and thus deserving of contempt.

Now think back to a time when you skirted your conscience, either by pretending you couldn't hear it or that it was safe to ignore it. We've all done this. Try to recall what it was like. Part of you _knew_ you were doing wrong, but the _wrongness_ was carefully hidden from conscious self-reflection. It is a kind of self-deception — and it is precisely the same mechanism that enables the "bad people" to do what _they_ do. Theirs may be much more extreme, but it works on the same principle.

It turns out that _contempt_ can only be generated from within this state. Why?

The reason that "bad people" need to rely on self-deception is that some part of them _doesn't want to be doing wrong._ This means that they are not "fundamentally" morally defective. They are far more like us than we are willing to admit.

Something in your mind is actively shielding you from seeing this. It does this by making you feel contempt — a toxic emotion that you would otherwise never feel. That in turn causes you to act in ways that provoke your target into doing things that justify your contempt, thus licensing more righteous wrath — the most delicious feeling of all.

When you do this, others can tell — even if only subconsciously, and even if you cannot — that you are acting maliciously, and not for the benefit of the world. This appears evil to them for precisely the same reason that they do to you. They know that you are trying to push them further into the dark and calling this "righteous." They thus perceive you as someone lacking the moral authority to be scornfully judging anyone, and feel the urge to put you in _your_ place.

Part of you _knew_ this would happen, and _wanted_ it, because it "proves" that you were right about them. After all, any decent person would have simply repented in the face of such noble fury.

Contempt is a self-reinforcing delusion whose only purpose is to prevent you from discovering our shared humanity, by encouraging others not to. It is a way to keep people trapped in darkness while feeling good about it. It is _evil._ Full stop.

This can be incredibly difficult to admit to ourselves, but it's also necessary. If we don't see this, it means that we're still immersed in self-deception — and in this state, we cannot _reduce_ the self-deception of others; we can only amplify it. In other words, we can only inspire more evil, despite what we may consciously tell ourselves.

Perhaps MLK said it best:

> *Darkness cannot drive out darkness; only light can do that. Hate cannot drive out hate; only love can do that.*

Evil is not actually a _presence_ (like it seems), but an _absence_. The absence of what? Of the perception of the profound interconnectedness of all life. This absence cannot be "extinguished"; it can only be dispelled through illumination. This may sound like spiritual mumbo-jumbo, but part of you knows exactly what I mean. Everything comes down to remembering this. The more you do, the more you remember how to banish evil.

This is called _compassion_ (or what MLK called "love") — but it doesn't mean being _nice_ or lovey-dovey. Sometimes it must be fierce, or perhaps even violent, as we will later see.

---

Although evil is an absence, there _is_ a terrifying way in which it behaves like a presence.



---

This feeling is a lie. Part of you knows that you are not "fundamentally" better than anyone. Contempt exists only to maintain this lie: it causes you to provoke them into behaving in ways that _prove_ their "badness," thus licensing even more contempt. That is its _only_ purpose.

This behavior makes the world darker — something a "good person" isn't supposed to do. So your subconscious hides this fact from you, making you perceive your behavior as _righteous._ Any increased darkness can be blamed entirely on them. This is a form of self-deception.

It turns out that self-deception is also how the "bad people" are able to do what _they_ do without remorse. They know perfectly well when what they are doing is wrong, but the _wrongness_ is cleverly hidden from conscious self-reflection.

This wouldn't be necessary unless _some_ part of them didn't want to be doing it. Consciously, you may not believe this, but subconsciously, you can perceive it. But now you're in an even bigger pickle: your attempt to prove how different you were just proves how similar you are.

---
---

Something deep within us knows that there's no _intrinsic_ difference between us and them; that we ourselves are capable of almost anything under the right circumstances. Our subconscious uses contempt to help this fact stay hidden from consciousness. It does its job well, which is why you may not believe me when I say that you already know this.

To take an everyday example: consider what happens when we mock our political opponents. Don't they just dig in their heels, see _us_ as evil, and vow to fight harder? We tell ourselves that we had "good intentions" (to shut them up; force them to introspect; convince others not to join them, etc.), but the truth is that something in us is _trying_ to maintain the polarization.

This ultimately harms the world, and part of us knows it. But "good people" don't do such things, and so we must hide this fact from consciousness. But wait a minute: what if the "bad people" are doing exactly the same thing? What if they're hiding _their_ misbehavior from conscious self-reflection, too — which would only be necessary if there's some part of them that doesn't want to be doing it, which means that... oh, sh*t, maybe our cruelty isn't so noble after all. Maybe we're just shoving that part of them further into the abyss. That would be _evil._

It's not that they don't know that what they're doing is wrong. The worst people will even openly _admit_ that it is, and that they enjoy it. But even then, this knowledge must remain cleverly hidden 

I'm not speaking hypothetically. If you look carefully enough at your mind while feeling contempt — and this is _hard_ — you will find that part of you can actually perceive this about people, and is searching for clever ways to gleefully push them further into the dark and then hiding this from yourself, just to bolster your own self-image. Not to put too fine a point on it, but this is _evil_ — and this is true _regardless_ of how bad they are or what they've done.

But you don't do this because you're a "bad person": that very notion is the problem. You do this because of a strange quirk of human psychology — one that is best described in mythopoetic terms.




---

But just pause and reflect on how much more viscerally satisfying it is to watch a bad person "get owned" than to have a change of heart. The latter would rob us of the unspeakably gratifying pleasure of seeing evil get "destroyed."

Our contempt naturally leads to malice, which is a very effective way to help "bad people" stay bad. Even if there is a tiny part of them that wishes to be free of their darkness — a possibility that we flatly refuse to countenance — we ensure that it stays suppressed. In the same way that witnessing acts of kindness can restore your faith in humanity, your malicious intent is (secretly) designed to produce the opposite effect in your target and all others who witness it. Your "allies" will subconsciously reframe this as a "necessary evil," and thus noble.

Keeping people trapped in the dark is hardly the mark of a "good person," and so this drive must remain subconscious.


---
---

Why is it so hard to eradicate evil? Could it be that something within us is secretly fighting to keep it alive?

That might sound absurd to you, or even offensive. Yet it is the truth — and without seeing this clearly, we have no hope of winning the fight.

---

When you think about the "bad people" of the world — whoever they are — it's hard not to feel at least a little contempt. But this emotion isn't merely counterproductive: it's a sign of something much darker.

If you look carefully enough into your mind while you are feeling contempt, you will discover that something in you is secretly plotting a way to create _more hostility_ in the world. Of course, it will not tell you this: instead, you will feel like you are doing something _righteous._

To take a simple example, consider what happens when we mock our political opponents. Don't they just dig in their heels, see _us_ as evil, and vow to fight harder? We tell ourselves that we had "good intentions" (to shut them up; force them to introspect; convince others not to join them, etc.), but the truth is that something in us _wants_ more polarization, because it allows us to feel self-righteous — as delicious a feeling as they come.

As a more extreme example, didn't the architects of the "War on Terror" _know_ that indiscriminately bombing the sh*t out of people would just inspire a new wave of "terrorists" who they would then "unfortunately" have to destroy too? The answer is both yes and no: a part of them certainly knew, but they were only able to justify it to themselves by shielding the immense _wrongness_ from conscious self-reflection; from the part of them that would put an end to it if forced to confront it.

We can see this in their eyes when they speak: they are clearly lying through their teeth when they pretend they did it for noble reasons. But if this inspires contempt in you, then what you're not seeing is that _your eyes are taking on precisely the same look!_

It is completely inevitable: any time you feel contempt, your mind is secretly trying to increase the enmity in the world while finding a way to convince you that it is good — and it _will_ find a way.

---

When you think about the "bad people," you probably can't help but feel intrinsically superior to them. They seem _fundamentally morally defective_, quite unlike you.

Yet there is a sense in which you are _not_ fundamentally different (which we will get to soon), and there is a part of you that _knows_ this. It knows that your self-righteousness is ultimately baseless. But it also knows that you don't want to see this, and so to hide it from you, it does something very clever: it provokes more evil in them, to reassure you of how different they are.

How? It's really clever: simply by feeling self-righteous, you appear like a "bad person" to them. Think about it: if someone self-righteously puts you in your place (whether you deserve it or not), do they appear _noble_ to you? Of course not. They look like pompous jerks who need to be put in _their_ place. Contempt looks slightly evil — whether it comes from a "good person" or a "bad person" — and people tend to respond to it as such.

We may try to hide our contempt, but part of us is actually making sure they feel it. When this is met with a predictably unhealthy response, we tell ourselves that we're simply exposing evil that was already there. We refuse to recognize our role in _provoking_ it; something we are astonishingly good at, though we probably don't realize it.

As I said, part of us _does_ realize it, but that part is hiding this fact from our consciousness. Why? Because if we knew we were provoking evil, it would destroy our self-image as "good people." This is a form of self-deception, which turns out to be precisely the mechanism that enables the "bad people" to do what _they_ do. Part of them knows perfectly well that they're doing wrong, but that knowledge is carefully shielded from conscious self-reflection.

If you really want to stop them, you have to force them to own up to their self-deception. Yet if you try to use "force," you will only end up looking self-righteous, because that is how you _feel_.

The solution is simple (though far from easy): you must discover the full extent of your own self-deception, starting with your hidden desire to provoke evil in others. The more you see this, the more clear it becomes that you're not _fundamentally_ unlike them. This is not something I can describe to you unless you've already seen it. But the more you do, the less possible it is to feel contempt.

The more completely you have done so,

Why is it so hard to eradicate evil? Could it be that something within us is secretly fighting to keep it alive?

That might sound absurd to you, or even offensive. Yet it is the truth — and without seeing this clearly, we have no hope of winning the fight.

Let's start with an obvious example: why do we enjoy mocking our political opponents? The first thing to acknowledge is that we _do_ enjoy it. We can come up with numerous reasons why it's helpful (it shuts them up; it forces them to introspect; it convinces others not to join them, etc.), but there's a much darker reason for our enjoyment.

Part of us knows that it will lead to increased polarization, and we _want_ this. Why? Because there is something uniquely gratifying about violently defeating evil — and the more clearly we highlight theirs, the exponentially more satisfying it will be when we finally extinguish it once and for all. We need their evil to be unmistakable so that we can feel completely righteous about the profound violence that we intend to visit upon it.

Part of us believes that we are merely honing in on the evil that is already there, but another part of us knows that we are also _provoking_ it. We may believe that such provocation wouldn't work if they had any decency, and so the fact that it _does_ is proof that they are intrinsically bad — but we don't realize just how outrageously clever we are at pushing people's buttons. Something in us _needs_ people to be fundamentally broken, and will stop at nothing to "prove" it.

We may be aware of this dark tendency in ourselves, and evey try to avoid it, but it goes far deeper than we realize. And mockery is far from the only tool that we use: any time we perceive someone as _fundamentally morally defective_ — evil, in short — _something_ about our behavior will be secretly designed to provoke it, whether we are conscious of this or not. It is completely inevitable. It might be as subtle as stoking outrage in others, to lay the groundwork for future action.

So what's the solution then? To just let evil win? No. The trick is to understand how it works.

We've all had the experience of skirting our conscience, either by pretending that we couldn't hear it, or that we could safely ignore it. Try to remember what that state is like. It is a kind of self-deception. This is the secret mechanism behind _all the evil there ever was._ People know perfectly well when they're doing something wrong, but the _wrongness_ is carefully shielded from conscious self-reflection. 

Their subconscious shielding is so clever that it convinces us (and often even them) that _no_ part of them knows — which could only mean that they are, indeed, fundamentally defective. Thus begins our righteous assault.

Here's the thing: as we saw, our attack is surreptitiously designed to provoke more evil. If you inspect your mind carefully enough while this is happening — and this is hard — you'll discover a horrifying truth: that part of you _knows_ this is wrong, but you are carefully shielding this fact from yourself. In other words, you are being self-deceptive — and this will make _you_ appear evil in _their_ eyes. And this isn't by accident: it is precisely what enables your provocation to work. Of _course_ they are going to react poorly to what they perceive as evil! This was the secret plan all along!

This can be extremely hard to admit to ourselves, for obvious reasons. But until we do, we can never understand what drives other people's evil, and are thus incapable of healing it. 

Our behavior isn't nearly as bad as that of people who commit atrocities — and our self-deception is correspondingly much weaker. Yet despite this, we _still_ struggle to confront it. It is always painful to discover that we've been deceiving ourselves, and this is only _more_ true for the "bad people." That's what prevents them from confronting the full wrongness. We think that their misbehavior should be _more_ obvious to them, but we've got it exactly backward — and we are _motivated_ to.

If you want the "bad people" to confront their misbehavior — which is the only way to end it — you _must_ understand how their self-deception works. This is not an intellectual thing that you can get from a book. It requires seeing how it operates in your own mind. You will know you've succeeded when you stop seeing "evil people," and no longer feel even a trace of malice or self-righteousness toward anyone. These are unmistakable signs that it is still operating in you.

---

If you had instead perceived them not as "fundamentally defective" but as engaged in profound self-deception — which is the truth — then you would have behaved very differently. You might still have leveraged mockery (or perhaps even violence), but there would have been no trace of self-righteousness to it — and others can subconsciously detect this. It prevents their "evil" from finding the hook that it needs to justify itself.



There is obviously something very different about what we are doing and what the "evil people" are, but there is also something very much the same — and as long as we harbor that part of ourselves, we are always at risk of becoming them, whether like to admit this or not.

[^armageddon] We also know that this "Armageddon" that we are trying to provoke — the day when our Good violently prevails over their Evil — will not lead to lasting peace. It is just another form of escalation itself.

Why is it so hard to eradicate evil? What if the tools we've been using to fight it are secretly weapons _of_ it?

Take a moment to think about what's "wrong with the world" and bring to mind the people responsible. Do this until you can really feel some animosity. They obviously know that what they're doing is wrong, and deserve to be punished for it.

We all know that we're not "supposed" to hate people (even bad ones), and that it's "right" to show them compassion. But these admonishments have little impact on us until we see exactly _why._ There's something truly astonishing to see here.

When you feel animosity, your mind is secretly gearing up to harm the world in some way that you won't consciously recognize as harmful. A simple example is when we mock our political opponents. We may describe it as "fighting evil," but part of us knows that we're only doing it to provoke them into behavior that will justify even more mockery — or worse.

It's not that mockery has no place in the fight against evil. Sometimes it may indeed be a helpful tool. But when we wield it with animosity, we're not actually _trying_ to help anyone — certainly not them, but not even the world. We're just justifying our vengeful instincts by dressing them up as righteous. This may be a hard pill to swallow, but it's crucial that we see this clearly.

There is a bizarre state that our minds occupy, in which we hide our true intentions from even ourselves. We know perfectly well that what we're doing is wrong, but that _wrongness_ is carefully hidden from conscious self-reflection. This is precisely the state that the "bad people" are in, and until we see clearly how it operates in ourselves, we have no hope of defeating the evil "out there."

This state is caused by a kind of mind-virus, and an especially clever one. It makes us do its bidding without ever realizing that we are infected. One of its greatest tricks is to make us search for other "infectees" and then behave in ways that will _deepen_ their infection: we find the "bad people" and then provoke them into becoming _worse._ The way this works is fascinating.

By activating our malice, it makes us appear evil to them (and to everyone else, whether they are consciously aware of it or not. Our "allies" are mostly not, for obvious reasons). This serves as a signal to _their_ viruses that we too are infected. The parasites then perform a kind of "secret handshake," in which they agree to empower each other while convincing their hosts that they are fighting.

Think back to the "mocking your political opponents" example. Consciously, you feel like enemies, but if you introspect carefully enough, you'll find that your darkness is secretly _allied_ with theirs. Your parasites have a common goal: to increase the animosity in the world, while convincing you that this is _righteous_ and _necessary_. Evil never actually _fights_ evil; it is always on the same team.

If you zoom out, you wil discover that _all_ of our parasites are secretly allied in this way. In fact, if you are perceptive enough, you will notice that they behave more like outgrowths of a single malevolent "distributed organism" that is manipulating _all_ of our minds. This isn't some abstract theory: as best I can tell, everyone who pays careful enough attention eventually discovers this.

Every time you feel hatred, malice, contempt, or even just self-righteousness, you are secretly feeding the Beast. It is completely inevitable. If you think you've found an exception — some uniquely evil person who _requires_ your malice — it just means that you are being manipulated especially hard. Alas, I won't be able to talk you out of it any more than you can simply talk them out of _their_ infection.

Even before you feel malice, there is an easy way to detect your infection. If you perceive the world as being comprised by "good people" and "bad people," the parasite has already accomplished most of its work. There is no actually dividing line; there are only those of us who are presently more and less infected. 

---


This doesn't mean we're "bad people." In fact, the very root of the problem is dividing the world into "good people" and "bad people"; those who deserve our compassion and those who deserve our animosity. That division exists for only one purpose: to provide you with people who it feels _right_ to mistreat.

In the same way that we dress up certain misbehavior as "righteous," the "bad people" do too. It is a kind of self-deception, and everything comes down to seeing how it works. 


---
---

People are only able to misbehave while under the sway of a particular mind-virus. People who are frequently under its sway we call "bad people," and those who are most deeply infected we call "evil people."

You are infected by this virus, too. It's mostly dormant, but it gets triggered when you encounter "bad people." It makes you want to be cruel to them — even if it's just light cruelty, such as mocking.

You may think that there's nothing wrong with mocking bad people, but that's the whole point: while under the sway of the virus, you never feel like you are. Misbehavior somehow just feels... _right._ That's why the "bad people" are able to do what they do.

Part of you knows perfectly well that you don't mock your enemies to help them "see the light," but mostly to provoke them into behaving in ways that will justify more mockery... or worse. But it is _so hard_ to admit this to yourself while you're doing it. It feels so convincingly like you're "fighting evil."

While possessed by the virus, there is always a part of you that _knows_ — but that part gets smaller and smaller the worse the infection gets. Even in "evil people," there is a tiny part that knows — their "inner light," so to speak — but this part is very hard for them to access.

We cannot tell when we are under the sway of our virus, but other people can. In fact, we _want_ them to. Why? Because the same way that other infected people look "evil" to us, we look (slightly) evil to others while in its grip. That's what makes mocking our enemies so effective: they feel like they're being judged by a _bad person,_ which is something they won't tolerate. Who would?

If you look carefully, you will discover that the desire to be cruel to "evil people" is secretly a desire to push their "inner light" deeper into the abyss; to deepen their infection. This is _malevolent._ That doesn't make you a "bad person" — if I thought so, I'd just be making the same mistake. What's happening is that their virus is triggering yours, as if through resonance.

If you "listen" carefully, you can hear all of our viruses resonating together. It is like a background hum of evil. At any given moment, mine is ready to trigger yours, and vice versa. They only need the right conditions.


To be clear, it's not that mockery is always wrong. Sometimes it can be a helpful tool.

---

What is the best way to fight evil? The obvious answer is to find the "evil people" and defeat them, but there is a very good reason that this plan hasn't been working: it's actually not meant to.

Evil behaves like a parasite that infects people's minds and alters their very perception. It makes the "infectee" see certain other people as subhuman, and thus fair game for cruelty. They know perfectly well that this is wrong at _some_ level, but the parasite cleverly shields that "wrongness" from conscious self-reflection. It is a form of self-deception.

We are all familiar with this schism of mind. We've all had the experience of skirting our conscience, either by pretending that we couldn't hear it, or that we could get away with overriding it. It is a kind of self-deception, and it is precisely this mechanism that enables _all_ evil.

When the parasite infects someone who considers themselves a "good person" — like you or me — it does something especially clever: the "certain other people" who it makes look subhuman are the "bad people." Think about it: doesn't it feel positively _righteous_ to treat those people with cruelty? It may be hard to admit this to yourself, but part of you knows that this is a dangerous lie.

When we viciously attack a "bad person," part of them can sense that we are under the sway of exactly the same parasite that they are. Therefore, we have no moral authority by which to judge them. So, far from simply repenting, they now see _us_ as evil, and include us in their group of "people who deserve cruelty." We take this as confirmation that they, likewise, belong in _ours._

This plan _can't_ work to end evil, because it was designed by the parasite _not_ to work. On the contrary, it is specifically designed to _strengthen_ the grip of the parasite in all of our minds — and it is working astonishingly well. Somehow, after thousands of years, we haven't caught on to its trick.

So is the solution to _not_ fight "evil people"? Not exactly. The trick is to see that there _are_ no "evil people"; only people who are more and less infected by the parasite. Once you see this — really _see_, and not just _believe_ — you no longer feel like you are fighting _people_. You are only ever fighting the parasite that has infected _all_ of our minds.

Sometimes, fighting the parasite certainly takes the _form_ of fighting people. So then what's the difference? You never feel _malice_, the sinister pleasure of watching people be harmed. You're not gleefully shoving the "bad people" further into the dark, like you were when under the sway of your parasite. You feel no _self-righteousness_; the sense that you are fundamentally better than anyone else. You can now see clearly that you are not; that this idea has **always** been the parasite talking.

This is called _compassion,_ and other people can sense it. There is no particular form that it must take. It can be fierce or even violent if necessary. But your fundamental benevolence prevents their parasites from using your evil as justification to further infect their minds. This makes **all** the difference in the world. It is the only way to actually fight evil instead of unwittingly spreading it.

That is why the fight against evil _must_ begin with doing everything in your power to find and evict the parasite that has secretly commandeered your mind.




---

There is something uniquely pleasurable about violently punishing evil, so our subconscious does something very clever: it seeks out "evil people" and then makes us behave in ways that provoke them, so that we feel licensed to escalate our righteous wrath. Part of us would be disappointed if they were to instead "see the light" and repent — even though that would be far better for the world. It is more satisfying to watch them suffer.

The really clever part is _how_ we provoke them. The mere _intention_ to provoke evil is itself evil — and their subconscious can sense this. It makes them perceive _us_ as evil, which they then feel compelled to fight. But because we are convinced that we are behaving righteously, we take this as confirmation that they are indeed evil — precisely what we needed to license escalation.

Our subconscious secretly orchestrated this, but it hid the plan from our conscious minds. This is self-deception. As it turns out, this is precisely the mechanism behind _all_ forms of evil: people know perfectly well when what they are doing is wrong, but the _wrongness_ is carefully hidden from conscious self-reflection.

This behavior is caused by a kind of parasite that lives in our minds. It manipulates our very perception so that we literally _see_ some people as deserving of malice. For you, it is the "bad people" — those who are fundamentally morally defective. But the thing is, they're not _fundamentally_ defective; they're actually under the sway of the very same parasite.

Your parasite is tricking you into overlooking the parasite in others, so that you behave in ways that give _their_ parasite the ammo it needs to trick them into doing the same right back at us. Don't you see? Your parasite and theirs aren't enemies — they are _allies!_ **All** of our parasites are allied, getting us to behave in ways that strengthen each other's at every turn.

This is that secret "evil global conspiracy" that everyone fears exists — and part of it lives within your very own mind. While under its terrible sway, every single thing you do to "fight" evil out there only amplifies it.

Its greatest trick is to convince you that it does not live in your mind, but only "out there." Maybe you think that okay, fine, you have a _tiny_ role to play in the world's ills, but still, the evil people are the real problem. But the truth is, once you are totally free of your parasite, that illusion falls apart — because you now directly perceive their parasites.

We've all had the experience of doing something wrong while convincing ourselves that it's not. What we may not realize is that literally _all_ evil depends on this mechanism of self-deception.

We are motivated not to see this, because it allows us to see ourselves as fundamentally different from the "bad people." And that enables us to harm them without feeling bad about it.

Harming "bad people" gives us the righteous feeling of fighting evil — except that part of us knows that they're not fundamentally different, and that this behavior just makes their minds darker.

This would be painful to admit, but luckily for us, their minds becoming darker just makes us more sure that they are fundamentally bad, licensing us to escalate our violence instead of confronting what we're really doing.



---

It is hard to admit, but there is darkness within each of us. It is not _intrinsic_ to our minds, but is more like a parasite. It knows that we are unwilling to harm people unless we see them as less than human — which most of us know is wrong. So it uses a clever trick: it alters our perception so that we see the darkness as intrinsic to some people's minds. We call them "bad people" and see them as subhuman, so that harming them becomes not just okay, but positively righteous.

Consciously, we don't realize that we're being manipulated; it feels like we're expressing a natural and healthy instinct to violently attack evil — which we now mistakenly equate with attacking the _people_. But no matter how subdued our attack (e.g., mockery), our underlying malicious intent makes us appear evil to them for exactly the same reason that they appear evil to us.

This has the effect of driving their darkness deeper into their minds, making it appear even more surely intrinsic, which inspires even more righteous violence from us, in a downward spiral. We act dismayed by their recalcitrance, but our darkness actually orchestrated this descent. We may not be conscious of this, but our "victim" is certain that we are, again for the same reason that we are sure that _their_ evil is fully volitional.

Our darkness tricks us into behaving in ways that will convince others that ours is intrinsic, because it knows exactly how theirs operates and will respond — _because ours and theirs are identical_. In fact, they are not just identical, but are more like outgrowths of a single shared "shadowy presence" that continually manipulates all of our minds; the _Devil_, if you will.

This is not just a wacky religious idea: it seems that everyone who introspects carefully enough eventually perceives this "distributed malevolent entity" which has a kind of intelligence and volition of its own that, even if not _literally_ true, explain its seemingly-coordinated behavior far more accurately than if ours were independent.

It is the primordial "evil global conspiracy," and it lives in all of our minds. Every attempt to maliciously subdue it "out there" just strengthens it, because such behavior is only ever initiated by it, even though it makes us believe that it was initiated by us. Contempt is its most insidious tool precisely because it appears to be the most unmistakably righteous.

There may well be groups of particularly darkened people who conspire to cause great harm, but their existence wouldn't be possible if the rest of us weren't feeding the source — and conversely, it is _inevitable_ given that we are. **We must hold such people accountable**, but when we do this with contempt, we are injecting more evil into the world. It _will_ find a way to manifest somewhere, though we will disown all complicity for it.

The only way for humanity to defeat the Devil is to stop falling for its tricks. Any time you feel malice, hatred, contempt, or even self-righteousness toward another being; any time you see them as fundamentally defective or inferior; you are being manipulated, and this _will_ create more evil. As you begin to clear up this misperception in your own mind, you discover what is causing it in others'. Only then can you do anything genuinely useful about it.

The topic of what such "useful" behavior looks like is vast and is beyond our scope. Such behavior depends entirely on circumstances, and is impossible to reduce to principles, except for one: the more deeply it is rooted in compassion — i.e., free of the above misperception — the more beneficial it tends to be. Being _entirely_ free is enlightenment; perception of our fundamental unity. (Note that this profound unity is also what allows the Devil to exist.) Rest assured that compassionate action _can_ be outwardly violent.
