When wise people urge compassion for evildoers, they're not suggesting that we be _nice._

Think of compassion and malice as existing on opposite ends of a spectrum. Compassion is your profound love for the world, and can manifest as being pleasant and agreeable (i.e., _nice_), or fierce and even violent, depending on the situation. Malice just cares about causing harm to its target, though it often uses "the greater good" as justification — especially if we fancy ourselves "good people."

The two can be _very_ hard to tell apart: are we causing harm in the genuine service of good, or only in the _name_ of good? Is it an expression of our love, or of our darkest tendencies _masquerading_ as love? Does our intention even matter? After all, harm is harm, right?

No. _It is precisely this confusion that enables evil to creep into the world undetected._ The way this works is insanely clever. It is worth paying careful attention to the next few paragraphs.

People are only able to misbehave due to a kind of self-deception: part of them knows that what they are doing is wrong, but that "wrongness" is carefully hidden from conscious self-reflection. But from our perspective, the whole thing seems fully conscious, and can only be explained by their being somehow _intrinsically_ defective. So we see "evil," and we viciously attack it.

But part of us actually _knows_ that they're not "intrinsically" defective; that they're only able to behave that way due to a quirk of human psychology (self-deception) that we ourselves share. We don't necessarily love it when other people correct _our_ self-deceptive behavior, but it can help us self-reflect and change for the better. However, when they do it _maliciously_, we perceive them as evil, and feel morally obligated to fight back. This only convinces them that *we* are evil, and so they ratchet up their malice, resulting in a downward spiral into Hell.

Part of us knows that _our_ viciously attacking "bad people" will induce exactly the same spiral, but another part of us pretends that this behavior is righteous. We tell ourselves that it will force them to self-reflect, but this is a crock. Does this sound familiar? It is _self-deceptive misbehavior_. We hide its "wrongness" from conscious self-reflection, but other people are convinced that it's fully conscious, and therefore that we are evil, and that they must viciously attack _us_. We are doing _exactly_ the thing that we blame the "bad people" for — _and they know it,_ even though we don't.

If we could see this clearly, we would instantly recognize this insane trap that the whole world is caught in, which would snap us out of the hypnotic loop of malice. We would find "a better way." But we somehow _can't_ see that we are doing this, and so we sleepwalk into that trap, thus creating more evil while convinced that it is righteous. If we (the "good people") can't recognize our own profound self-deception, how in hell do we expect _them_ (the "bad people") to?

The truth is that part of us doesn't _want_ them to, because this way we can maintain our self-image as "good people" fighting the "bad people." In fact, it is this very illusion of being one of the (precious few) "good people" that makes us behave in a way that _ensures_ that they never escape their horrifying delusion (while convincing us that this is righteous). It is what compels us to see their misdeeds as "intrinsic evil" instead of recognizing it as the self-deception that it actually is.

This is how "good people" create evil without (consciously) realizing that they are doing so. (There are of course people without a self-image as "good people" who _also_ create evil, though their mechanism for doing so is less circuitous.)

_This_ is why they urge compassion for evildoers: the only other option is to be (and create more) evil while pretending that you're not. Compassion means giving up the self-serving distinction between (fundamentally) "good" and "bad" people. Of _course_ there are relative differences between people that must be accounted for, but the "fundamental-ness" is a sinister illusion.

It doesn't usually manifest in the mind in such an obvious way. It's often more subtle: a vague sense of contempt, superiority, or self-righteousness. These are all signs that we're about to darken the world. If your mind were free of darkness, you simply could not feel those things. You would instead feel heartbroken that minds can become so twisted, and that you have no way of showing people what they're really doing — unless they are open to seeing it.

The first time you discover this in yourself, you will be brought to your knees in abject agony over the horror that you've been inadvertently been perpetrating on the world. This is the first dawning of compassion.

In a world beset by hatred, any kindness can be a radical act — but especially so when it's in response to evil.


"Kind" is not the same as "nice." Nice is about being pleasant and agreeable. Kind is about behaving in accordance with your deepest values.

The true nature of your mind is pure compassion; a profound love for the world. Sometimes expressing that love requires causing harm to other people. But there is also a kind of parasite that lives in your mind
