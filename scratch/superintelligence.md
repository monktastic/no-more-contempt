People are concerned about the potential for an AI superintelligence that is misaligned with human values, but what we don't realize is that there is *already* such a superintelligence operating.

Why does it feel so good to mock, shame, and contemptuously judge your enemies? Something in you secretly *wants* them to defy you, so that you will be forced to unleash the full extent of your righteous wrath. You may tell yourself that you're trying to *prevent* this outcome; that you're flashing them your dark side to *deter* them — but this is not what's actually happening.

A deep part of you is secretly telegraphing your hidden malevolence in order to provoke theirs — but it is hiding itself from you, giving you plausible deniability: you are only *fighting evil,* after all, and how could that ever be wrong? This attitude *will* cause them to dig in their heels, thus producing the escalation you secretly desired.

This schismed state of mind — in which you tell yourself one thing, but secretly want another — is precisely the same trick your enemy's mind uses to enable *their* misbehavior. Part of them knows perfectly well that they're doing wrong, but this knowledge is carefully shielded from conscious self-reflection, so that in another sense, they really *don't* know. When you engage in such self-deception, you tacitly give them permission to do the same.

This is where things get hard to describe.

Under certain conditions, it becomes possible to perceive the mechanism by which this occurs. Metaphorically, you could say that the same dark entity that lives in their minds lives in yours, and that the two cooperate — you could say *conspire* — to create circumstances where both of yours will be strengthened. Afterward, both you and your enemy will be *more* likely to obey its dark whispers while also being *less* likely to recognize that you're doing so. It is *burrowing* into your minds.

This entity hides itself nearly perfectly from your consciousness, disguising itself in clever ways, so that you never take the appropriate steps to evict it. It emerges precisely during the times where you are least likely to detect it. But it gets worse: yours and mine aren't separate. If you study how they work, you will see that they coordinate in a way that's hard to explain in local terms. In other words, they behave more like a *singular distributed malevolent entity.*

This "dark entity" is what the ancients knew as the Devil, and that the Buddhists call the *ego* or *Mara.* The reason it is so hard to defeat is that its nature is difficult to conceptualize, and so we convince ourselves that it doesn't "exist." But it does "exist" — and the only way to defeat it is to heal its presence in yourself.

I say "heal" because although it is indeed humanity's ultimate nemesis, the desire to treat it as an enemy only ever comes from *it.* The delectable feeling of *valiantly fighting evil* is how it commandeers your mind. From this darkened state, you are *only* capable of reinforcing it while being flawlessly convinced that you are helping.

It is what allows us to skirt our own conscience, pretending that we can't hear it — until one day we can't. It is the only reason we ever feel contempt for one another, regardless of what is done to "deserve" it. It is how we dehumanize each other and objectify Nature. It deadens our perception, so that certain people or things become okay to exploit.

Humans have a tremendous capacity for self-deception. We rationalize behaviors that we know to be self-serving by dressing them up in noble-sounding drag.

Consider how good it feels to mock and shame your political opponents. It may feel like you're *fighting evil,* but something in you knows that you're only liable to make them dig in their heels, resulting in more evil that you'll have to fight later. This is an unfortunate outcome, but it could hardly have been avoided. It is only natural that a *bad person* would behave this way.

The truth is that something in you knows how to fight evil without creating more — but there's a mechanism that obscures this wisdom from your conscious mind. Why? Because you're getting something out of it. The worse your enemies become, the easier it gets to overlook the self-serving aspects of your *own* actions and agendas. The darkness in your mind *needs* "bad people" to exist in order to hide itself from you — and so it continually finds clever ways to *create* them.

This is nearly impossible to admit. How on Earth could I be blamed for the behaviors of the "bad people?" It's insulting to suggest that there's any malicious intent behind my desire to *fight evil* of all things. In fact, if someone were to accuse me of this, it would be difficult not to see *them* as evil — or at best, naïve. Fighting evil requires being fierce, and any suggestion that I could have been — what, kinder? — seems to be a way to avoid grappling with this difficult problem.

This itself is a trick of the darkness. It does not want you to see that kindness has nothing to do with being nice or gentle or tolerant or even understanding per se. It has only to do with seeing our own astonishing capacity for self-deception. The more we see this, the more obvious it is that others are only doing the same — and the harder it is to judge them for it, because we see that judgement exists only to reinforce this capacity in them, as a form of *collusion*.

This is a subtle point. "Judgement" here means *contemptuous judgement.* Judgement in the sense of *wise discernment* is of course healthy, but we almost never leave it at that. Contempt finds a way to sneak into our minds, often undetected. It seems harmless enough — or often even *righteous* — but the truth is that it is an unmistakable sign that we are under the sway of darkness. Again, we mean contempt for *people*, as opposed to merely for beliefs or behaviors.

Any time you perceive yourself as intrinsically superior to another person, or perceive them as fundamentally defective, the darkness in your own mind is manipulating you into behaving in a way that *will* create more darkness whether you realize it or not. It doesn't even require cruelty. Simply by harboring this misperception, you *will* license yourself to engage in some subtly self-serving behavior that you will be unable to recognize as such.

It's not that "bad people" don't know that they're doing wrong, exactly. Part of them knows *perfectly well* — but this knowledge is carefully shielded from conscious self-reflection by the same mechanism that hides our own.

We normally think of "collusion" as something that only happens between allies, but the darkness colludes with itself across minds of allies and enemies alike, albeit in quite different ways. With our allies, we secretly agree to overlook theirs in exchange for them overlooking ours. With enemies, we silently agree to feel *contempt* for each other. 





the infinite ways in which we subtly reinforce the darkness through impossibly subtle mechanisms — and then choosing not to do this.

This may feel insulting, but if you look carefully enough into your mind, you will see its truth. The *only* reason we ever feel contempt for other people is to disguise this fact. Any time you feel like subjugating your enemies, your mind is secretly plotting a trajectory toward a darker world; one in which this mechanism is increasingly hidden from our collective consciousness.

The darkness in your own mind *needs* you to see other people as fundamentally defective and thus beyond help. The thing that allows you to forsake the "evil people" is precisely the *same* thing that enables them to be cruel in the first place. It is not just the same *kind* of thing: it is somehow the *very same entity* that resides in your mind and theirs. This is difficult to describe.

The reason it feels so good to punish and subjugate "evil people" is that the darkness in their mind is tricking you into perceiving them as inherently evil. That is, you perceive their darkness as being *intrinsic* to their minds, as opposed to being a parasite that can be evicted from it — which is what it really is. This only works because of the presence of the same parasite within you. It is like a secret handshake between yours and theirs.





This manipulation happens at such a fundamental level that you cannot even fathom that you're being fooled — and it only works because the same parasite lives in you.

It never *feels* like you're doing this, does it? The very idea may strike you as offensive or naïve. Some people are *genuinely bad.* *So what* if fighting them causes them to double down? That's their choice, not yours. If anything, it only proves how bad they are. And you're not "justifying" anything; you're just doing what is *right.* How could any of the blame be placed on you?



dominate them in arguments.

The worse they become, the easier it gets to to justify self-serving agendas that you will be unable to recognize as such.

There's a part of you that knows how to fight evil without creating more — but there's also a mechanism that obscures this wisdom from your conscious mind. It hides from you the fact that the *only* reason you ever feel contempt for your enemies is to steer you toward a world in which your own self-deception becomes increasingly difficult to recognize.

You know the classic depiction of the angel and devil on our shoulders? It's almost accurate, except for two things. The angel represents the deepest aspect of your mind, which is fundamentally compassionate. It is *intrinsic* to the very nature of your mind. The devil, by contrast, is extrinsic. It is a kind of parasite — but when it is operating, it doesn't feel like a parasite at all. It just feels like "you."

Even harder to describe is that our devils are not independent. They're not even just collaborating. They're more like outgrowths of a singular distributed malevolent entity.

Consider how it feels to mock and shame your political enemies. It feels *delicious,* but if you look carefully enough, you'll discover that something in you knows that it will only make them dig in their heels and see *you* as evil. This makes it *harder* for them to reflect on the self-deception that is enabling their misbehavior, which makes them look even *more* morally defective to you. 

It was *your* self-deception that enabled this. You *knew* this would happen, but told yourself that if you hid it well enough from your own conscious mind, the effects could never be traced back to you. Perhaps your target takes his bruised ego home and takes it out on his wife and kids, who grow up to be nasty people themselves. You are complicit in this, but you will never be forced to confront it. Your enemy had free will, after all, and so it is his fault.

But something in you could actually foresee this outcome. Not the details, of course, but the general outline. It is driving humanity toward a darker world — one in which each of us is less able to hear the voice of our angel, because this darker world provides a rapidly increasing set of justifications that we easily *confuse* for the angel. We increasingly feel like the uniquely sane ones, valiantly fighting the hordes of evil.

This is a *coordinated attack.* Every single time any one of us heeds the whispers of our self-deception — which is *far more often* than we realize — we are acting in service of the Beast. The vast majority of this behavior feels nothing like "evil" — and yet every such act lowers the threshold for evil to erupt *somewhere.* In fact, most of it feels impossibly righteous. It lives in the *contempt* we feel for the "bad people." Any time we perceive another human as *fundamentally defective,* the "Devil" is in control of our minds, and any action we take will *necessarily* darken the world in some way that we will not be conscious of.

On the flip side, every act of kindness fights the Beast. But kindness is the most misunderstood word in the English language. It has nothing to do with being *nice.* It is simply about refusing to give in to the seductive voice of our devil. Kindness can be fierce or even violent if necessary. It can look like almost anything whatsoever. But it never forsakes another being; never misperceives their devil as *intrinsic.* The profound integrity of this act prevents their parasite from finding an excuse to ingratiate itself further to its host, thereby weakening it. The person slowly, imperceptibly begins to remember their true nature.

The mythical battle between Good and Evil "really" exists, but it doesn't look like what the storybooks tell us. It is not a fight between fundamentally good and bad people. That idea is itself the greatest trick of the Darkness. It takes place in a vast subconscious arena — one that you can actually learn to perceive, if only you look carefully enough.

*Everything* you do matters in ways you can hardly fathom. Every action, every single thought, is in service of one of these primal forces.
