When you shame or mock your political opponents, it may temporarily suppress their misbehavior. But it _will_ increase the net hostility and polarization in the world. You may tell yourself that it won't, or that it's their fault if it does, or that the benefits outweigh the drawbacks, but part of you knows that these are just lame excuses for malicious behavior.
