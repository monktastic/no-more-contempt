The real reason we hate "bad people" is to prove to ourselves that they're *inherently* bad. Part of us knows that they're only doing the same thing we are (self-deception), and that our contempt will provoke them into behavior that reinforces their self-deception (making them worse). We therefore know that our contempt is itself self-deception, but being conscious of this would be devastating (by revealing our hypocrisy to ourself), so we hide it harder, which only makes it more obvious to them, which makes them dig in their heels harder, which proves us more right.

Although this whole thing is hidden from our conscious mind, part of us is secretly telegraphing the whole thing to them. That's how it knows

L1: trying to let them know they're a bad person so that they'll stop.
L2: trying to bait them into behavior that will make them worse, so we can prove they're evil.
L3: trying to make them worse so that there's more darkness in the world.

When we treat our enemies with contempt, they dig in their heels, because it makes them see *us* as evil, which they feel justified to fight by any means necessary (enabling more self-deception). But this just proves they're evil, forcing us to escalate.

Part of us intended this. We knew it would happen, and wanted it, because it proves us right.

But how does it work? Part of us knows that contempt is only possible via self-deception, and that this is the same thing they use to cause harm—so that by showing it, we would be revealing our own darkness, which would make them double down.

Contempt for evil people is unique, because it's not just causing harm; it's pretense.

A: We're equal
- I know that in some sense, I'm not fundamentally superior to you.
- You know that I know (2x)
- I know that *you* know that I know (3x)
- I know that *you* know that I'm being hypocritical (=5x)
- ... etc. (common knowledge that we're equal)

B: Pretending to be superior
- I know that I'm pretending to be.
- ... etc. (common knowledge of pretense)

C: Hypocrisy (depends on A, B)

D: I want you to see my hypocrisy (depends on C)
- I want you to *see* my hypocrisy
- I know you know I want you to see it

E: Hiding EVERYTHING from myself (depends on C,D,F,G,H,I?)
- I know I'm hiding all this from myself
- ... etc. 

F: Unprovability of EVERYTHING (C,D,E,G,H,I ?)
* I know there's no evidence of this

G: Evasion = I will get away with EVERYTHING (depends on F)
- I'm committing a crime I'll get away with

H: This will make you embrace your darkness (depends on EVERYTHING including H)
- I know this will drive you mad and make you dig in your heels

I: Proving you're evil (depends on H)
- I will use this to prove you're evil



- I know that *you* know that I'm provoking you in this way.
- I'm hiding it from myself, and I'm indicating that to you. That's even more of a provocation.

When I see others as "bad people," part of me wants to be proven right. I would rather not discover that they're fundamentally decent people acting out of confusion—much like myself, if more extreme—even if it's true; because that would rob me of my right to feel self-righteous.

This unconscious need drives me to act in ways that subtly nudge them toward proving me right. It's important that it be subtle, or else I'd become aware of my own complicity, which would defeat the whole point.

It turns out that simply seeing them as *bad people* is enough. How?

I know that suggesting that they're subhuman will make them see


I'm signaling that I'm better than you, knowing on some level that this will grate on you and make you dig in your heels, which will license me to escalate.

For this to work, it must appear malicious to you but innocent to me. I can accomplish this by telegraphing my plan to you while hiding it from myself.

In fact, it will be made even more effective by telegraphing that I know I'm doing *that*—hiding my plan from myself while telegraphing it to you.




Part of me recognizes this as malicious, so I suppress that knowledge. But my subconscious realizes: if we can telegraph this message to our enemy but hide it from our conscious mind, then when it inevitably makes them dig in their heels, we can pretend it wasn't because of us—and thus escalation will be justified.

But the deviousness of this plan makes it even more malicious than before.
