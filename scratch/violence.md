Is violence ever the answer? If not, why does the Dalai Lama—supposed exemplar of peace—justify it under [certain circumstances](https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/dalai-gun/)?

> *If someone has a gun and is trying to kill you, he said, it would be reasonable to shoot back with your own gun. Not at the head, where a fatal wound might result. But at some other body part, such as a leg.*

What *other* circumstances warrant it, and to what extent? Is there a general principle that we can use as a guide? If so, on what basis?

There's a simple answer to these questions—but it's remarkably difficult to communicate.

Consider what happens when we mock, shame, and contemptuously judge our enemies—the "bad people." They only tend to dig in their heels and fight back *harder*, don't they? But why?

The obvious answer is that, well, they're *bad people*, so of *course* they would be resistant to correction. Expecting anything else would be naïve. But that's not the correct answer.

The truth is that something in us secretly *wants* them to dig in their heels, because it proves us right in our worldview—that our enemies really are beyond hope. We're therefore left with no choice but to escalate until they submit. 

On the surface, we lament this unfortunate turn of events, but part of us secretly enjoys it—for there is *nothing* more primally, viscerally satisfying than violently punishing evil. Something deep within us *wants* to be forced to unleash the full extent of our righteous wrath—and so it subtly, imperceptibly, steers us *toward* that outcome.

Of course, it doesn't come out and tell us this. It always does it in a way that's seemingly aligned with our conscious values, lest we catch on to its sinister influence. For example, we're not the kind to harm innocent people, and so it started our assault small. Shaming can hardly be called "violence"—and anyway, our enemy already begun to reveal that they're far from innocent—so our behavior couldn't possibly be wrong.

Yet no matter what do—whether being nice or firm—our enemies only seem to get *worse.* We've given them every chance to course correct, and they've failed to take it. We hate that it's come to this, but we're left with no choice. The kid gloves must come off—and it's entirely their fault.

---

But something in us knows this is a sham. We were never truly *trying* to help them correct course; we were only making it *appear* so, while our deeper goal was always to prove ourselves right: that they *have* no ability to correct.

This may sound absurd to us. Of *course* we wanted them to see the Light! Who wouldn't? And anyway, why should our *intent* matter? Only our *behavior* has any effect, and shaming someone out of compassion looks the same as shaming them with contempt. So even if—hypothetically—we secretly wanted to see them fail, there's no way it could have made any difference.

At least, that's what we tell ourselves.

But the truth is that something in us was subtly communicating our intent to them at every turn. It was secretly revealing the malice in our hearts, knowing that this would make them see *us* as slightly evil, which would make them feel morally *compelled* to fight back—no matter what they had to do to achieve this result.

At the same time, this part of us was hiding the fact that it was doing this—so that when they inevitably weakened their integrity in response, we could pounce on it as proof that they *have* no integrity. Only truly defective people would behave the way they do toward such righteous, upstanding people as ourselves.

---

The more subtle the communication of our hidden malice, and the less aware we are of doing it, the more effective it is—which is the *opposite* of how we expect things to work. 

If we were to *consciously* lure them into this trap, it would be too obvious, and they would fail to take the bait. So the only way it *can* work is if we're unaware of it ourselves. We *must* consciously believe that we're really fighting evil, while at the same time secretly hoping that they fail. Then we need to ensure that this dual message comes across. But how can we execute such a fiendishly precise plan without even being aware of it?

That is the secret purpose of *contempt.* It conveys: I'm going to *treat* you as though you're beyond help, even though I know you're not, because I know this will appear righteous to the world, allowing me to shove you into the abyss while being hailed a hero. This bit will drive you *extra* insane, which will make you resist harder, which will make it seem even *more* unmistakably righteous, etc., in a recursive feedback loop from which I will not let you escape.

Moreover, I'm signaling to you that I know I'm doing this, while convincingly pretending *not* to know—and so there's no part of me that you can appeal to to make it stop.

All of this is communicated with such astonishing subtlety that there exists no trace in the physical world that any such thing transpired. And that is the final nail in the coffin. It is the *perfect* crime, because even you have no idea that you perpetrated it.

Except that part of you will always know—and that will be your undoing.

Therefore, the more effective it is, the less likely we are to believe that it's happening at all, or to even consider it as a possibility.
