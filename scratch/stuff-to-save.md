Consider how good it feels to mock, shame, and contemptuously judge our enemies. We tell ourselves that this will somehow benefit the world, but the truth is that something in us secretly *wants* them to defy us, so that we will be forced to unleash the full extent of our righteous wrath. *Nothing* feels better than violently punishing evil.

This is incredibly difficult to admit. Not only because we are increasing the "net animosity" in the world — which would be bad enough — but because of how we accomplish it. The deepest part of you can actually perceive your commonality with your enemies — that they are only able to cause harm due to a kind of confusion that you yourself share — but it seizes on this opportunity to shove them deeper *into* the abyss in a way that it can disguise as righteous.

This is *malevolent.* If you look carefully enough, you will discover that it has the same signature as *all the evil there ever was*. This is why your enemy defies you: because you are flashing them *genuine darkness.* But it never feels like that, does it? It is only by discovering the fiendish cleverness of this trick — by which the darkness manipulates you into doing its bidding while convincing you that you're not — that you begin to appreciate exactly how the "bad people" are confused.
