What we think of as evil is more like a kind of mind virus—but when people are infected, we don't recognize it as an infection; we see them as *inherently* evil. We therefore treat them in ways that drive the parasite deeper into their minds, which makes them seem even *more* obviously evil, in a vicious cycle. 

If we could see that it was only an infection, we would recognize our profound duty in helping *evict* it from them, thus making the world a brighter place. But we can't, and so we end up making it a darker one instead.

The reason we can't see it is that we ourselves are infected. Our virus actively *shields* us from seeing it, because if we did, we would discover how to weaken its grip on our world. So it does everything in its power to stop us, by making others appear *fundamentally defective.* This way, harming them feels not only okay, but positively righteous. 

It is this trick that has enabled *all the evil there ever was,* from the tiniest unkindness to the most horrific atrocity ever committed.

Simply harboring this misperception—of ourselves as inherently superior to *anyone*—is itself enough to darken the world. How? By powerfully signaling to others that we're in the grip of darkness—a fact that we ourselves cannot see. This teaches them that genuine goodness does not exist; that even the so-called *good people* are easily seduced by the very thing they claim to hate whenever it suits them. *That* thing has the real power—so why not embrace it?

We are *inviting* them into this perspective, and then viciously judging them for falling for it. 

This isn't abstract philosophizing. If you look carefully enough into your mind while feeling contempt, you can literally *feel* the dark aspect of your mind reaching out into the world to find resonance with others—both friends and foes. It reminds them that *darkness is the way*; that the Light is only a myth. The reason you might be unable to sense this is that it is powerfully distracting you.

It feeds you clever stories about how your behavior will be a net good; how you're not darkening the minds of others, but merely exposing the darkness *already there*. But to you, these aren't stories: you can literally *prove* to yourself how your behavior will be a net good, causing you to overlook the part of you that knows this is just a self-serving rationalization. Most insidiously, it prevents you from noticing that these stories are coming from *it*, and not from *you*. *It speaks to you in your own voice, so that you never suspect who's really in charge.*

It hijacks not only your perception—making others appear *evil*—but your *entire cognitive apparatus*, so that you are left with no way to detect its subterfuge. Because you are entirely reliant on your thoughts, you never notice that a deeper aspect of your mind is sounding a red alert. Or you tell yourself it's safe to *override* this alarm—because if it really knew better, it would be able to explain *why*, using the only language you trust: your thoughts. But *it doesn't speak that language*—and so, ironically, you end up distrusting the one thing that *actually knows.*

This is why our culture fetishizes thinking and rationality to the exclusion of all else: the darkness has maneuvered us into this corner by convincing us it's the only *safe* place—giving it carte blanche to manipulate us at its whim. We never notice how many of our thoughts are self-serving rationalizations because we have abandoned the part of us that can tell; relegating it to the dustbin of religion. How could there be a part of you that knows when your behavior will darken the world, when you yourself can prove otherwise? There couldn't—and you can *prove* it!

It is not until we see just how cleverly it has fooled us that we begin to appreciate exactly what is going on in the minds of the "bad people," and what we can do about healing it. Until then, our every behavior will be subtly *empowering* humanity's ultimate nemesis, even as it convinces us that we are valiantly fighting it.

What we think of as evil is more like a kind of mind virus, whose job is to make people overlook the *life* in others. This is the only way that "evil people" can do the horrible things they do—and surprisingly, it is also the reason we hate them for it.

Every one of us is infected to some degree or another. A deep part of us knows this, and that the "bad people" are not fundamentally different from us—but our virus hides this fact, making us hate them. But they subconsciously recognize this as the very essence of evil, which helps them feel more justified in theirs. Then, since we don't recognize that we provoked this, we take it as proof that they really are beyond help, thus licensing us to escalate.

This is how the virus uses humans to spread itself without our ever noticing.

It's astonishing how subtle this process can be. It doesn't even require *hatred*, which most of us recognize as dark. Contempt alone is enough. This feels like a righteous sentiment, but it conveys the same underlying message. It says: *we both know I'm not better than you, but by pretending to be, I can throw you under the bus while looking noble for it—and I'll get away with it, because you can't prove that I'm doing this. Heck, even my own conscious mind doesn't know.*

The fiendish cleverness of this hidden message effectively ensures that they will embrace their own darkness.

This is why our enemies dig in their heels when we mock and shame them. It's not our behavior itself that causes this, but this subtle signal that we injected into it. Without it, mocking and shaming can sometimes produce good. But with it, the ultimate effect is to further darken the world—even if it produces a temporary benefit in the meantime, such as shutting them up.




Except that part of us *does* realize this
