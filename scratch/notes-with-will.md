- Evil's greatest trick
- Willful ignorance
- Self-deception
- You would think that the more evil an act, the more obvious it is to the person doing
- Schism

- Caused by parasite
- Angel and devil (angel is your true nature; devil is the parasite)
- Doesn't just whisper ideas in your ear; alters your very perception of reality
- So that the world needs your contempt to fix it
- But what you don't see is that the people who deserve your contempt are under the sway of the same parasite
- If you treat them with contempt, they cannot understand why, and they cannot help but perceive you with contempt in return.
- This is what the parasite wants: escalation toward a kind of Armageddon.
- In US politics we are escalating toward civil war.
- In marriages we often escalate toward divorce. It's a kind of Armageddon in which both people perceive themselves as the righteous one who is being victimized.

- In fact, they aren't really separate
- Distributed organism leveraging our collective intelligence to produce outcomes which are inevitable given our collective self-deception
- If we were to string up all the "evil elites"
- You know how some people feel that the elites are playing us off each other?

- Your enemy isn't other people; it's the parasite in their minds.
- You can only remove their parasite in others to the degree that you are not under the sway of your own.
- Resolve the willful ignorance in your own mind. A good measure of this is how much you believe that your malice is there to help the world.
- It is said that if you're not outraged, you're not paying attention. Wise outrage is anger aimed at correcting injustice. The parasite adds in self-righteous indignation. How much of that do you still feel?
- Because otherwise you are just doing its bidding without realizing it
