Who's directing all the outrage? Is there some central coordinating agency? Even sitting at home feeling contempt for a faraway politician spreads it. Distributed intelligence thanks to common knowledge.

## Contempt parties

When I gather with my allies to scheme against you, ours are working together, beneath our "conscious" thresholds. Have you ever felt that? The way something in the room shifts—how quickly strategy slides into mockery, concern into contempt? Someone makes a cruel joke, everyone laughs a little too hard, and slowly we unleash our dark sides.

It's as if there's an _unspoken force_ moving through the group—a tacit agreement that needs no words: *Let's stop playing nice. If it's darkness they want, it's darkness they'll get.* You can feel everyone silently giving each other permission, coordinating without ever saying it directly.

And if you dare name it out loud—"Hey, maybe this isn't right"—that unspoken force turns on you. You're naive. You don't understand what we're up against. The group ejects you not through explicit decision, but through that same wordless coordination. Because if you made it explicit, the cover of plausible deniability evaporates, and that *must never be allowed to happen.*

**The darkness thrives in the shadows. It depends on them.**

## Cultural evidence

Why is it "common knowledge" that humans are *fundamentally* greedy and selfish? Does that knowledge make people kinder, or more likely to engage in selfish behavior themselves? Don't we all already know this, even if we've never thought about it consciously? Can you feel how it's sending the same basic message as when we mock someone: "this world is a dark place, better protect yourself"—and how it has the same effect?

If the parasite draws power from one person doing that to another, how much power would it draw from all of humanity believing it together—not just vaguely, but as received wisdom, impolite to question?

The people who *do* become kinder as a result—can you feel how they're standing in defiance of the dark; giving it the middle finger? How they're holding the line for the rest of us? How do you feel knowing such people exist? Do they inspire hope in something greater?

Those who stand in firm, selfless integrity even when no one's watching—maybe you. Do they do it because natural selection mindlessly made them, or are they fiercely committed to something beyond all justifications and rationalizations... something we all know but struggle to name?

The view that reality is made of lifeless stuff—do the industries that pollute rivers, decimate forests, strip-mine mountains, etc. benefit from it? Is it because their CEOs got together and published a memo? Or is it enforced—through social norms—far beyond their boundaries? Does it ever feel like there's a life-denying, life-destroying force that's devouring everything?

Hollywood churning out revenge fantasy films viscerally reminding us that *irredeemably* bad people exist, and must be defeated through primally satisfying violence—help or hurt the parasite? Again, do you think the Hollywood execs had to intentionally plan this?

It is why our culture fetishizes rationality and intellect above all else: those aspect of mind are fundamentally incapable of detecting the spreading infection until _after_ it has physically manifested, by which point it is too late. We trust our thinking minds to tell us when they're lying to us, and then use more thoughts to prove that thinking is all we have. If there really were an "inner Light," we would be able to prove it; and since we can't, there's no point in looking for it. [this last sentence may need to wait until after the light reveal, unless there's an easy fix.]

It is why wise people tell us to have compassion for evildoers but our culture treats this as naive.
