## Who's behind all the outrage?

Who's directing all the outrage? Is there some central coordinating agency? Even sitting at home feeling contempt for a faraway politician spreads it. Distributed intelligence thanks to common knowledge.

## Shadow Spaces

You've felt this: someone drops a cynical comment, testing the waters. Part of you instantly knows which signal to send back.

If you match their frequency, something opens up. **These are shadow spaces**—temporary alliances where our parasites coordinate.

[Crucial: notice the A/B threading. A and B are in one scenario, B and C in the next, etc. And each character has logical continuity (no racist also doing privilege work).]

---

### Tax fraud

After basketball, Mike mentions he "forgot" some cash income on his taxes. "I mean, the government wastes it anyway, right? And look at all the corporate tax loopholes..."

Jake grins. "Exactly. My guy who does my books is _creative_."

Notice what Mike just did? He didn't just justify his behavior—**he pointed to systemic corruption as if it licenses his own.** He's treating their darkness as a reason his should exist.

---

### Sexual objectification

At a work event, Jake mentions a colleague in a way that's... testing boundaries.

Tom laughs. "Dude, careful. HR's everywhere."

But there's something in _how_ he says it. Not "that's inappropriate"—more like "don't get caught."

Each one genuinely believes he's done nothing wrong. The plausible deniability isn't just for others—it's for themselves.

But they're creating an atmosphere where women become objects—things to be assessed, used, enjoyed. And that energy doesn't limit itself to women.

---

### Gossip disguised as concern

"I'm really worried about Lisa," Jennifer says to Tom after the work event. "She seems... off lately."

Tom: "Oh my god, yes." Now they can dig in. All while maintaining they're just "concerned."

---

### Virtue signaling

Sarah posts about "doing the work" on her privilege. But it's performative—positioning herself as one of the good ones.

Jennifer and others pile on with their own performances. Each secretly relieved they don't have to actually change.

---

### Casual racism

At a BBQ, David mentions frustration with "those people" moving into his neighborhood. Doesn't specify who.

Mike (from the basketball game) matches the energy. "Yeah, the whole area's changing."

Shadow space opens.

---

Notice: **Mike, Jake, Tom, Jennifer, Sarah, David—threading through different shadow spaces.** Mike's at the basketball court, then at the BBQ. Jake and Tom are both at the work event. They're moving through different contexts, different transgressions.

None of these are "bad people." Mike coaches little league. Jake volunteers at the food bank. Sarah shows up to protests. They each have genuine moments of integrity.

**But here's what's actually happening:**

Mike's tax fraud doesn't just affect taxes. It weakens the membrane between him and _all_ his darkness. Later, when he's at the BBQ and David tests the waters with his casual racism, Mike matches the energy more easily. Not because tax fraud "causes" racism—but because **each time he ignores his conscience in one area, the pattern strengthens everywhere.**

Jake's objectification doesn't just affect how he treats women. It makes Tom more comfortable joining Jennifer's cruel gossip after the event. Tom and Jennifer's gossip feeds Sarah's performative activism. Sarah's virtue signaling enables Jennifer to participate in more gossip. Jennifer's darkness feeds David's casual racism.

**The content is completely different. The energy is identical.**

This is the mechanism: not "monkey see, monkey do." Not even "hurt people hurt people." Something more precise:

**Each shadow space weakens everyone's membrane between Light and darkness.** When I participate in my shadow space, I'm not just affecting the people in the room. I'm making it easier for strangers across town—across the country—to participate in theirs. Through resonance. Through the shared field our parasites coordinate in.

---

**Notice something about yourself:**

Which examples made you feel contempt? Not just "that's wrong"—actual contempt for the person.

**That's your parasite,** showing you which shadows aren't yours. The ones you can safely judge.

The examples where you felt compassion? Those are closer to your own shadows.

---

And here's what our darkness needs us not to see:

**It requires a world where disintegrity is the norm.**

If integrity were normal—in our culture, institutions, leaders—your small acts of self-deception would stand out. You'd feel pressure to confront them.

But as long as there's systemic corruption, your parasite has cover.

This is why our darkness doesn't just need us to _believe_ in evil elites. **It needs to actively empower them.**

Every time we point at their corruption while engaging in our own, we're making a trade: we keep our small shadow spaces, and in exchange, we feed the large ones.

Mike needs corporate tax loopholes to exist so his "creative" bookkeeping feels justified. David needs "those people" to keep moving in so his casual racism stays normalized. Sarah needs systemic injustice to exist so her performative posts feel meaningful. Jennifer needs workplace toxicity so her gossip feels like "concern."

**Their darkness is maintaining the very systems they claim to oppose.**

We say we're fighting corruption while our darkness depends on it. We consume outrage about evil elites while our parasite secretly needs them in power.

Because without them, we'd have nowhere to hide.

The conspiracy isn't just "out there." Our small shadow spaces require the large ones to exist—and every time we participate in ours, we're feeding theirs.

**And part of us has always known this.** Known that our contempt isn't stopping them—it's keeping them in business.

That's how it spreads.

## Contempt Parties

The conference room. Your political allies. The door closes.

Someone starts: "We need a strategy to deal with [the other side]."

Reasonable enough. Strategic. Professional.

But watch what happens.

Someone makes a joke. A little edge to it. Everyone laughs—a little too hard, a little too eagerly.

Someone else: "I mean, honestly, have you _seen_ what they're posting?" The energy shifts. Now we can share screenshots. Mock the typos. The hypocrisy. How _stupid_ they are.

"We're just pointing out the facts," someone says. And we are. Technically. Every criticism is true. Every example is real.

But something else is happening beneath the surface.

**The room is giving itself permission.**

What started as strategy is becoming something else. "We need to stop them" slides into "we need to _destroy_ them." Someone says what everyone's thinking: "Honestly, fuck these people."

Relief floods the room. Finally, we can drop the pretense. Finally, we're being _honest._

Watch the language: "These people are dangerous." "They're destroying everything." "We can't let them win." Each statement technically defensible. Each true from a certain angle.

But the _energy_ beneath the words? Pure darkness. Building. Feeding on itself.

Someone proposes something harsh. Not illegal—nothing we'd have to explicitly defend. Just... mean. Beneath what we'd normally do.

One person hesitates. "Is that really—"

"Do you not see what we're up against?" someone cuts in. "This is war. They'd do worse to us."

The hesitation dissolves. Of course. They're right. We're the good guys. We have to win.

**Here's the key:** When we leave that room, each of us can honestly say we were just "planning strategy." We discussed "messaging." We were "realistic" about the opposition.

The meeting minutes will look fine. But more importantly—**the story we tell ourselves will look fine.**

No one _consciously_ decided "let's be cruel." No one explicitly said "let's abandon our values." There were no mustaches to twirl.

We just let our parasites recognize each other and sync up. Let the darkness handle the details while our conscious minds maintained plausible deniability.

This is how war rooms work. Political campaigns. Activist groups sliding from justice into vengeance. Corporate boards rationalizing crushing competitors.

Everyone leaves that room a little darker. Won't realize it. Won't see they just participated in exactly what they claim to oppose.

**That's why conspiracies don't need explicit coordination.** Our parasites know how to make it all look kosher—even to us.

The darkness thrives in shadows. It depends on them.

**And the most effective shadow is the one cast by righteous purpose.**

## Cultural evidence

### Humans: greedy and selfish?

Why is it "common knowledge" that humans are *fundamentally* greedy and selfish? Does that knowledge make people kinder, or more likely to engage in selfish behavior themselves? Don't we all already know this, even if we've never thought about it consciously? Can you feel how it's sending the same basic message as when we mock someone: "this world is a dark place, better protect yourself"—and how it has the same effect?

If the parasite draws power from one person doing that to another, how much power would it draw from all of humanity believing it together—not just vaguely, but as received wisdom, impolite to question?

The people who *do* become kinder as a result—can you feel how they're standing in defiance of the dark; giving it the middle finger? How they're holding the line for the rest of us? How do you feel knowing such people exist? Do they inspire hope in something greater?

Those who stand in firm, selfless integrity even when no one's watching—maybe you. Do they do it because natural selection mindlessly made them, or are they fiercely committed to something beyond all justifications and rationalizations... something we all know but struggle to name?

---
### Reality: fundamentally lifeless?

The view that reality is made of lifeless stuff—do the industries that pollute rivers, decimate forests, strip-mine mountains, etc. benefit from it? Is it because their CEOs got together and published a memo? Or is it enforced—through social norms—far beyond their boundaries? Does it ever feel like there's a life-denying, life-destroying force that's devouring everything?

---
### Revenge fantasy films

Hollywood churning out revenge fantasy films viscerally reminding us that *irredeemably* bad people exist, and must be defeated through primally satisfying violence—help or hurt the parasite? Again, do you think the Hollywood execs had to intentionally plan this?

---
### Fetishizing intellect and rationality

It is why our culture fetishizes rationality and intellect above all else: those aspect of mind are fundamentally incapable of detecting the spreading infection until _after_ it has physically manifested, by which point it is too late. We trust our thinking minds to tell us when they're lying to us, and then use more thoughts to prove that thinking is all we have. If there really were an "inner Light," we would be able to prove it; and since we can't, there's no point in looking for it. [this last sentence may need to wait until after the light reveal, unless there's an easy fix.]

### Compassion for evildoers?

It is why wise people tell us to have compassion for evildoers but our culture treats this as naive.
