There is a darkness descending upon our world. Can you feel it? It alienates us from each other and from mother nature. It is how corporations pollute and desecrate in the name of profit; how factory farms inflict endless suffering that we've desensitized ourselves to; how brutal wars rage on while politicians craft elaborate justifications that line their pockets.

At times, it almost feels like there must be a single control structure orchestrating all this madness — an evil global conspiracy, if you will. In a certain sense, there is — and that feeling you have, of having a noble responsibility to end it, is accurate. There's just one little problem: any sense that this conspiracy lives entirely *outside* yourself will inevitably cause you to strengthen it, even as you're flawlessly convinced that you're fighting it.

The entire trick of the darkness is to make you overlook its presence within your own mind while sensitizing you to it in others. This makes you feel compelled to viciously attack — or at least contemptuously judge — them for it. What you cannot see in that moment is that this attitude is secretly designed to *reinforce* that pattern in them.

The only way you can feel contempt for another being — the sense that they are *fundamentally defective,* or that you are *intrinsically superior* — is by darkening your own mind. It *feels* impossibly righteous, but it only conveys to them that *darkness is the way.* It is *exactly* the same state a person must enter to commit atrocities. Your mind will tell you that it's entirely different — that you're doing it for a "good reason," and so it's not the same thing at all — but this is a lie.

The secret to ending evil; to bringing down the conspiracy; is to see exactly how this lie works.

It is always the same lie, though it takes many forms. It tells you that hardening your heart is

We hate all this but feel powerless to stop it. When we *do* find the resolve to confront it, we often externalize the problem: it is *someone else* who must be fixed or taught a lesson. Or maybe it is just human nature: perhaps we are fundamentally greedy; a kind of plague on this Earth, deserving of our inevitable fate.

But what if both of these orientations are

if it is this very orientation that *is* the problem — or perhaps more accurately, the mistake?

This might be triggering to hear — as though I'm accusing you of something. Please understand that I am not — that if I were, I would be falling into the very same trap.
