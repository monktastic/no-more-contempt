There is darkness in our minds, and it wants us to harm people, but it knows that we will only do this if we see them as less than human, which we would never do — or, so we think. This darkness is not intrinsic to anyone's mind; it is a kind of parasite. But our darkness alters our perception so that we _see_ it as intrinsic to some minds; i.e., we see some people as "fundamentally bad" — and therefore subhuman, and worthy of harm. This is a brilliant manipulation.

Consciously, we don't recognize that we're being manipulated by our darkness; to us, it feels like a natural and healthy instinct to violently attack evil — which we now equate with violently attacking _people_, because we misperceive their evil as intrinsic. But no matter how subdued our violence may be (e.g., just mocking them), our underlying malicious intent will have the effect of driving their darkness deeper into their minds, which will make it appear to be even more obviously intrinsic, which inspires even more righteous violence, in a downward spiral.

This isn't an accident: our darkness orchestrated it. We may not be conscious of this, but our "victim" is convinced that we are — for precisely the same reason that we're convinced that _their_ evil is fully volitional: namely, their darkness manipulates their mind into seeing our darkness as intrinsic, inspiring them to righteously attack us. This is how the darkness is driven deeper into both of our minds.

In other words, our darkness tricks us into behaving in ways that will convince others that ours is intrinsic, because it knows exactly how theirs operates and will respond — _because ours and theirs are identical_. In fact, they are not just identical, but are more like outgrowths of a single shared "shadowy presence" that continually manipulates all of our minds; it is the _Devil_, if you will.

This is not just some wacky religious idea: I think that everyone who introspects carefully enough eventually perceives this "distributed malevolent entity" which has a kind of intelligence and volition of its own that, even if not _literally_ true, explain its seemingly-coordinated behavior far more accurately than if each of ours was independent. It explains _so much_ of humanity's group dynamics.

It is the primordial "evil global conspiracy," to which all the rest ultimately filter up — and we are its secret minions. Every attempt to maliciously subdue it "out there" just strengthens it, because such behavior is only ever initiated by it, even though it makes us believe that it was initiated by us. Contempt is its most insidious tool precisely because it appears to be the most unmistakably righteous.

There may well be groups of particularly-infected people who conspire to cause great harm, but their existence wouldn't be possible if the rest of us weren't feeding the source — and conversely, it is _inevitable_ given that we are. **We must hold such people accountable**, but when we do this with contempt, we are still increasing the net evil in the world. It _will_ find a way to manifest somewhere, though we will disown all complicity for this.

The only way for humanity to defeat the Devil is to stop falling for its tricks. Any time you feel malice, hatred, contempt, or even self-righteousness toward another being; any time you see anyone as fundamentally defective or inferior; you are being manipulated, and this _will_ create more evil. As you begin to clear up this misperception in your own mind, you discover what is causing it in others'. Only then can you do anything genuinely useful about it.

The question of what such "useful" behavior looks like is vast and is beyond our scope. Such behavior depends entirely on circumstances, and is impossible to reduce to principles, except for one: the more deeply a behavior is rooted in compassion — i.e., free of this misperception — the more beneficial it tends to be. From here, you recognize the profound interdependence of reality, and begin to perceive the subtle networks of causality that enable humans to do the awful things they do.

Seeing this in its _entirety_ is enlightenment; perception of our fundamental unity. Compassionate action _can_ be outwardly violent, but it is always benevolent in intent — and this makes far more difference than we normally realize. This is the sense in which compassion is _always_ the right motivation.
