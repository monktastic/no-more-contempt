### Ch 1: Evil as mental illness

(This chapter is already fully written.)

1. Evil is best understood as a form of mental illness.
2. Once this is seen clearly, it is obvious that contempt for "bad people" is harmful: it only exacerbates the underlying condition.

### Ch 2: Self-deception

> _Ultimately evil is done not so much by evil people, but by good people who do not know themselves and who do not probe deeply._ --Roland Niebuhr

1. Have you ever done something that deep down you felt was wrong, but convinced yourself it was okay? Really try to recall what that state was like. You knew perfectly well that what you were doing was wrong, but that knowledge was carefully hidden from conscious self-reflection. This is **self-deception**. Part of you _knows_ and part of you _doesn't._
   - The part that knows its wrong is your **conscience** (not to be confused with "consciousness"). It is the voice of the deepest aspect of mind.
2. Self-deception is ultimately responsible for _all_ misbehavior.
   - Even the most evil person could not do what they do without it.
   - Conversely, you yourself are capable of almost anything under the right circumstances. 
   - When you hear a lying, hypocritical CEO / politician / banker etc., part of them _knows_ that they are lying, which makes you (rightfully) angry. At the same time, that knowledge is carefully shielded from conscious self-reflection. Contempt just drives it deeper underground.
3. **Contempt is a self-deceptive behavior.**
   - Seeing "bad people" get hurt is pleasurable, quite independently of any good it does.
   - In fact, it is even *more* enjoyable if they double down on their evil, because that licenses us to escalate our righteous violence — which is an _intoxicatingly delicious_ feeling.
   - So we subconsciously try to ensure that this outcome occurs — and then very cleverly hide this fact from ourselves, to maintain our self-image as "good people."[^self-image]
   - Our "victim" can subconsciously sense that we're doing this, which makes them perceive us as evil, which causes them to double down. Mission accomplished.
   - In other words, self-deception begets self-deception. This is a general principle. It is why **evil begets evil**.
4. We are more than happy to harm others _and_ increase the evil in the world, provided we have plausible deniability (harming "bad people" is inherently good). We do this to serve our egos.
   - Until you see this clearly, it is impossible to understand the mechanism that allows evil people to feel okay about what they do. The details differ, but the process is the same.
   - You cannot fix what you don't understand.
5. **The more forcefully your mind is trying to convince you that your unkind behavior is "a net good" (ends justify the means), the more surely you are engaged in self-deception  — not just here, but elsewhere in life, too.**
   - This is not to say that harming bad people is always wrong! Sometimes it is absolutely the right thing to do. But it feels very different when done without self-deception, and has a very different outcome (as we mentioned in ch 1 and will see again later). There will be no feeling of _justification._
6. The more a person engages in self-deception, the less they can hear their conscience, until they don't even remember that they have one. It slowly stops feeling like justifying evil and begins to feel like a desire for evil.
    - This is a spectrum; there is no fixed dividing line separating "good" and "bad" people.
    - The conscience itself never disappears or changes. This is the sense in which nobody is "fundamentally" morally defective (the basis of contempt).
7. The more clearly you see this, the less "evil" you see and the more self-deception you see.
    - You begin to detect subtle self-deception in all kinds of places that you wouldn't have described (or recognized) as "evil" before. You now see it's the same phenomenon, and it is ubiquitous, even amongst "good" people.
    - As your vision becomes more subtle, a surprising picture begins to emerge...

### Ch 3: The evil conspiracy

> _And no wonder, for even Satan masquerades as an angel of light. So it is not strange that his ministers also masquerade as ministers of righteousness._ —2 Corinthians 11:14-16

1. From a certain angle, evil appears like an intelligent organism that lives in our minds and manipulates us into spreading it while convincing us that we're fighting it. It is _insanely_ clever.
    - This is our darkness masquerading as our light.
2. Stepping back, it begins to appear more like a _distributed_ organism: your evil triggers mine, etc. This shadowy entity communicates with itself through the vast network of human minds, leveraging our collective intelligence to keep itself alive and growing.
   - Your contempt for "bad people" isn't just to see _them_ suffer: the evil in your mind knows that they will in turn make _others_ suffer, etc.
   - Every time you feel contempt, malice, hatred, etc., you are feeding the Beast. 
3. This is that archetypal "global evil conspiracy" that people fear is behind the world's ills; the one to which all the rest ultimately filter up. It is not run by a select group of evil people, but by the evil in _all of our minds together_.
    - We are the hardware on which the Devil himself runs.
    - **Your true enemy is not other people, but the evil in _all_ of our minds.**
    - There may well be groups of "evil" people who conspire to cause great harm, but their existence wouldn't be possible if the rest of us weren't feeding the source — and conversely, it is _inevitable_ given that we are.
4. What does it "want"? It escalates toward various kinds of Armageddon: conditions in which everyone gets to violently prove how good they are _once and for all_.
    - This is why the US is headed toward civil war, with nobody aware of their own complicity.
    - It is what [leads to bitter divorces](https://www.gottman.com/blog/this-one-thing-is-the-biggest-predictor-of-divorce/), in which each side feels like the exclusive victim / hero.
5. Each of us has a role to play in bringing this conspiracy down, and it begins with our own minds.

### Ch 4: The light at the end of the tunnel

1. Reality is actually one seamless interdependent whole.
    - When you see this, you see yourself in everyone and everything.
    - It is not realized fully until enlightenment, but everyone can sense it at all times.
    - This is why certain literature speaks us, and why we sometimes thank people for being kind to others even when we get nothing out of it.
    - When this is seen clearly, contempt and malice are impossible.
2. Ultimately, all self-deception boils down to hiding the fact that what happens to the world ultimately happens to you, because you _are_ the world.
3. This is what enables dehumanization and objectification — the very roots of genocide.
    - When you meet someone in this state, you can practically _see_ the evil in their eyes.
    - Similarly, when you feel contempt, that is how others perceive _you._ No wonder it backfires!
4. This means that all evil is ultimately rooted in a simple misperception. Defeating it means healing this perception.
5. When all desire for harm (for oneself and others) is eliminated from the mind, what remains isn't apathy or neutrality. Perhaps surprisingly, it is an impossibly fierce and uncompromising love for the world — one that is able to deal with all kinds of situations in a healthy way.
6. In other words, the ultimate nature of your mind is pure compassion; absolute goodness. This is your "inner light."

### Ch 5: The metaphysics of good and evil

TODO: innocence.

This chapter may be hard to swallow. Feel free to ignore it if it is too far out for you.

Several spiritual traditions describe life as a sort of dream.

1. "Long ago," you lost touch with your absolute goodness.
    - From this arose the fear that you may _not_ be good.
    - Instead of confronting that fear, you projected it outward, seeing _others_ as evil.
    - This gave you something to vanquish to prove your own goodness beyond doubt.
    - Unfortunately it just ended up making you feel even _more_ guilty, forcing you to project even harder.
    - Thus began a horrifying cycle that continues to this day.
    - It cannot end until you return home.
2. When is "long ago," exactly? This is the hardest part to explain.
    - What you perceive as "reality" is actually a kind of hallucination.
    - Space and time are constructs _within_ that hallucination.
    - So the hallucination itself did not start at a particular point in "time," exactly.
    - You only see "other people" because you're still projecting your own guilt.
3. The way to overcome the "evil" in your own mind is to return to your "inner light." That is the spiritual path in a nutshell.
4. The closer you get, the more easily you perceive the true inner and outer conditions that lead to any misbehavior, which enables a healthy response; one that does not amplify evil in the world.

### Interlude: psychedelics, NDEs, etc.

1. The healing power of psychedelics largely comes from their ability to give you a taste of the previous chapter.
2. This shows you, in no uncertain terms, that you have _no leg to stand on_ when it comes to contempt for bad people.
3. You try to plead ignorance, but you are shown repeatedly and forcibly, that part of you that _always knew._ You are the worst kind of hypocrite. (Don't worry, we all are.)
4. This is utterly horrifying, but ultimately liberating: you never wanted to become this way, yet one bad decision after another led you here. Why don't you understand the same about others? You are shown repeatedly until this becomes unmistakably clear.
    - In chapter ??? when I said that the malevolence of contempt isn't abstract, but can be _tasted_, this is what I was referring to.
    - Whenever you felt contempt, it was as though you are gleefully injecting evil into your target's very soul, while winking at them as if to remind them that you would get away with it.
    - The trouble is, you ultimately won't. Psychedelics are a preview of things to come.
5. NDE and the "life review."
6. Just as you dreamed up this reality, your next dream will be hellish or pleasant depending on how much burden is left on your conscience.
    - Clean it up _now._

### Ch 6: Compassion

1. Compassion does not mean being nice. It doesn't have to take any particular form. It is simply about being in touch with your "inner light"; free of self-deception.
    - Sometimes it involves being sweet and loving.
    - Other times, it must be fierce or even violent.
2. **Other people are _ridiculously_ sensitive to our motivations. "Benevolent" violence has a very different long-term result than malicious violence.**
    - This may not be obvious to the untrained eye.
3. This doesn't mean that you will necessarily know what behavior is best for the world. It only means that you will act with complete honesty and clean intention.
    - You still need to learn what is helpful and harmful in which situations. This is wisdom, which compassion must be paired with to be truly effective.
4. The only thing worse than letting evil win is secretly joining forces with it.

### Ch 7: Compassion for the planet

> _The earth is not dying, it is being killed, and those who are killing it have names and addresses._ —Utah Phillips

Can you feel the contempt oozing out of this quote? Yes, the people killing the planet have names and addresses: they are _us_; we who harbor contempt in the name of good.

To be completely clear: people certainly have varying degrees of complicity, especially when it comes to the immediate scope of their actions — and we _must_ hold them correspondingly accountable. But to the degree that we do this with contempt, we ensure the continued existence of such people, even if their details change. Even as we are stringing them up, we are secretly instructing reality to fill their shoes.

As we said in ch ???:

> There may well be groups of "evil" people who conspire to cause great harm, but their existence wouldn't be possible if the rest of us weren't feeding the source — and conversely, it is _inevitable_ given that we are.

At some point, the subtle threads connecting our contempt to their actions become impossible to ignore. You begin to see the signatures of your own misbehavior on the ills of the world. 

I said before that we see ourselves in everyone and _everything_. The same misperception that allows us to be cruel to other people enables us to be cruel to the biosphere; to objectify it. Nature is _alive_ in a sense that we somehow don't see yet, analogous to how people once didn't see other races as sentient, and how we're only starting to recognize other species as sentient (first primates, then mammals, ...). It is surely alive in a _different_ sense, but it deserves our compassion nonetheless.

Contempt is the wrong tool to save the planet. Your true enemy is not the people killing the planet; it is the self-deception in our minds that enables us to treat it with contempt.
