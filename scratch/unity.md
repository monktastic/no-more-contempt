Imagine, for a moment, that what some spiritual traditions say is true: that we are all One—but due to a kind of primordial forgetting, we seemingly split into countless beings, peering out at each other through countless eyes.

All misbehavior is secretly a plea for help; a request to be reminded of our true nature—the only lasting source of peace. But because it's so heavily distorted by countless layers of pain and confusion, others misinterpret us, instead using it as a reason to shove us deeper into the abyss.

Aside from the obvious metaphysical challenges of this story, there's a practical problem: loving evil people simply doesn't work. It only enables them. Moreover, we've all done wrong without consciously recognizing it as a cry for help ourselves.

But what if love doesn't mean what we think it does? What if it has nothing to do with being nice or gentle or tolerant or understanding, but instead simply means refusing to see the other as other? What if this allowed us to fight evil—fiercely, violently—in a way that didn't create more?

Would there be any reason to believe this story then?
