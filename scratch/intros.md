Kindness is the hardest word to define, but also the most important. It doesn't mean being nice. Nice means pleasant and agreeable, which are fine qualities in most normal situations but useless in others. Kindness, on the other hand, means something much more profound. It is the right orientation in literally _every_ circumstance. But how could kindness be the right response to evil?

Consider the "bad people" of the world — the greedy bankers; the hypocritical CEOs; the corrupt politicians (and all who support them). Don't they know that they're doing wrong? Of course they do — which can only mean that they are _fundamentally morally defective,_ and it is our moral duty to stop them by any means necessary. But here's what we can't see.

---

We think that hating "bad people" is a sign of the good within us, but it's actually a sign of something _much darker_.

---

It is always possible to see the Light in others — including those who convincingly seem not to have any. Doing so is far more important than you can imagine. Why?

---

Why do we hate "evil people?" It's not for the reason we probably think.

---

The greatest trick the Devil ever pulled was to convince us that he doesn't exist within our very own minds.

---

If you wish to defeat the evil in the world, you must first defeat the evil in your own mind. Why?

---

How are people able to harm others without compunction, or to benefit themselves at the world's expense? Surely, they must be _bad people_ — in other words, _fundamentally morally defective._ How are we supposed to stop them?

Anger is a completely natural, and even healthy, response to such misbehavior. But it is almost always accompanied by malice, contempt, or self-righteousness. These may feel healthy, too, but there's something crucial that we're overlooking.

---

As much as we may want to defeat evil in the world, an aspect of our mind continually sabotages our efforts. Moreover, part of us _knows_ that we're doing this. This is extremely difficult to admit — but it is only by appreciating that very difficulty that we begin to see the astonishing trap in which nearly all of humanity is caught...

---

Is it possible to fight evil without losing our humanity? And why _shouldn't_ we lose it? What could be wrong with using a bit of darkness to combat the darkness?


---

Compassion — especially for "bad people" — is profoundly misunderstood. It turns out it's a _motivated_ misunderstanding. There's something our minds don't want us to see.

---

Looking at the state of the world, you could be forgiven for believing that there's an _evil global conspiracy_ pulling the strings from behind the scenes. In a sense, there is — but it's not the one that you're probably thinking of.

---

Why do wise people urge compassion for evildoers? They're not telling us to be _nice._ They see something that we don't.

Why do wise people urge compassion for evildoers? Are they being naive? Or have we misunderstood what compassion is?

---

There is a darkness deep within our minds that convincingly masquerades as the Light. It tricks us into violently attacking the darkness in others, which only strengthens both of ours. It is an _insanely_ clever trap.

The more you unmask this deception in yourself, the more you enable others to do the same. This is the only way to extinguish evil instead of creating more. It is the only path toward the more beautiful world our hearts most deeply long for.

---

Why are we unkind to people who we perceive as "bad"? The answer seems obvious: we do it to make the world a better place. But this is an insidious lie. It explains why we're not _nice_, but not why we're not _kind_. Nice is about being pleasant and agreeable, which are surely unhelpful in some situations. But kindness means something much deeper. It is the right motivation in _every_ circumstance.

---

What if nearly everything you're doing to "fight evil" is secretly strengthening it — and moreover, what if part of you already knows this, but is actively concealing it from your conscious mind?

---

It feels really good to _stick it_ to "bad people," doesn't it? Why is that? It's not for the reason you probably think.

---

Have you ever had the experience of harshly judging someone for their behavior, only to later discover something about them that made you feel sorry for having done so?

What if I told you that it is _always_ possible to discover this in people — and that, moreover, an aspect of your mind can already see it?

You might think I'm exaggerating or being naive — that _intrinsically bad_ people exist, and contempt is helpful or even necessary in dealing with them. But this is a dark lie. 

---

We've all heard that "hate cannot drive out hate," but is it really true? What about something milder, like contempt? Surely contempt for _bad people_ can make the world a better place — certainly more so than being kind to them.


---

There's something uniquely pleasurable about making bad people hurt, quite independently of any good it might accomplish. But here's what we can't see.

---

There is a place deep within your mind that you can turn to know whether your intentions are pure.
