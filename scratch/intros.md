## Angle 1: The Socratic Hook (Grounded in Relatable Experience)

Humanity seems to be on a dangerous trajectory [...]. How do we get them to stop? [...]

---

Why is it that despite our best efforts, many of humanity's most pressing problems seem only to be getting worse, and evil seems to be on the rise? Are there simply too many "bad people" out there ruining it for the rest of us, whom we just have to fight harder?

Or could the truth be far stranger? What if the very framing of "good guys vs bad guys" is not merely mistaken, but secretly designed to perpetuate the problems it claims to solve? And worse, what if there's an aspect of _all_ our minds that's somehow conspiring to keep this hidden—something we can't see precisely because it doesn't want to be seen?

What then?

---

What if nearly everything we do to "fight evil" is secretly strengthening it—and what if part of us already knows this, but is actively concealing it from us?

Could this explain that haunting sense of an _evil global conspiracy_ we can never quite pin down?

If so, how could we ever outsmart this hidden part of ourselves, so we stop falling for its tricks?

---

The reason it's so hard to defeat the evil in the world is that there's an aspect of our minds that is secretly working *against* us. Until we discover and heal this part of ourselves, nearly everything we do to "fight evil" will only continue to strengthen it.

All the other major problems humanity faces—such as the accelerating collapse of our biosphere—are ultimately downstream of this of this one core mistake. It is therefore imperative that we address it as our first priority.

Have you noticed how often people believe their agendas are good when they're actually far from it? You can't simply talk them out of this state, nor can they even *think* their way out of it, because the problem lies much deeper than their thinking minds. It's as though their entire cognitive apparatus has been hijacked by something they can't see.

What if the same is true of us? How would we ever know it? And what could be more important than fixing it?

By its very nature, this problem cannot be solved, or even described, by addressing only your rational mind. Yet, to make it sound *irrational* would cause you to reject it out of hand. So communicating it requires walking a fine line, which we will attempt to do.

---

Humans are masters of self-deception. We grant ourselves special privileges at the expense of others, and then hide from ourselves the fact that we're doing this. Most of all, we tell ourselves that this is something only other people do — the *bad people* — and that we're nothing like them.

---

Have you ever noticed how hard it is to fight evil without creating more? We mock and shame our enemies, only for them to dig in their heels and fight back harder. Why does this happen?

We tell ourselves it's because they're *bad people.* After all, any fundamentally decent person would repent, or at least introspect, in the face of such overwhelming good. Their doubling down only proves they are fundamentally defective, thus compelling us to escalate.

---

Consider the "bad people" of the world — the greedy bankers; the hypocritical CEOs; the corrupt politicians (and all who support them). Don't they know that they're doing wrong? Of course they do — which can only mean that they are _fundamentally morally defective,_ and it is our moral duty to stop them by any means necessary. But here's what we can't see.

---

We think that hating "bad people" is a sign of the good within us, but it's actually a sign of something _much darker_.

---

Why do we hate "evil people?" It's not for the reason we probably think.

---

How are people able to harm others without compunction, or to benefit themselves at the world's expense? Surely, they must be _bad people_ — in other words, _fundamentally morally defective._ How are we supposed to stop them?

Anger is a completely natural, and even healthy, response to such misbehavior. But it is almost always accompanied by malice, contempt, or self-righteousness. These may feel healthy, too, but there's something crucial that we're overlooking.

---

Why are we unkind to people who we perceive as "bad"? The answer seems obvious: we do it to make the world a better place. But this is an insidious lie. It explains why we're not _nice_, but not why we're not _kind_. Nice is about being pleasant and agreeable, which are surely unhelpful in some situations. But kindness means something much deeper. It is the right motivation in _every_ circumstance.

---

It feels really good to _stick it_ to "bad people," doesn't it? Why is that? It's not for the reason you probably think.

---

Have you ever had the experience of harshly judging someone for their behavior, only to later discover something about them that made you feel sorry for having done so?

What if I told you that it is _always_ possible to discover this in people — and that, moreover, an aspect of your mind can already see it?

You might think I'm exaggerating or being naive — that _intrinsically bad_ people exist, and contempt is helpful or even necessary in dealing with them. But this is a dark lie. 

---

There's something uniquely pleasurable about making bad people hurt, quite independently of any good it might accomplish. But here's what we can't see.

---

## Angle 2: The Direct Confrontation (Grounded in a "Secret Knowledge" Reveal)

---

The greatest trick the Devil ever pulled was to convince us that he doesn't exist within our very own minds.

---

As much as we may want to defeat evil in the world, an aspect of our mind continually sabotages our efforts. Moreover, part of us _knows_ that we're doing this. This is extremely difficult to admit — but it is only by appreciating that very difficulty that we begin to see the astonishing trap in which nearly all of humanity is caught...

---

There is a darkness deep within our minds that convincingly masquerades as the Light. It tricks us into violently attacking the darkness in others, which only strengthens both of ours. It is an _insanely_ clever trap.

The more you unmask this deception in yourself, the more you enable others to do the same. This is the only way to extinguish evil instead of creating more. It is the only path toward the more beautiful world our hearts most deeply long for.

---

It is possible to realize, in retrospect, that we have always known something that we were sure we didn't know. So it is with the realization that all the unkindness we have ever shown *anyone* has only ever darkened the world.

---

## Angle 3: The Philosophical Premise (Grounded in a Core Axiom or Virtue)

It has been said that the greatest gift we can offer this troubled world is our own enlightenment. I want to give some intuition about why this might be true.

---

It is impossible to make the world better through your contempt—even for the "bad people." This is for a profound reason, and has far-ranging consequences.

---

Kindness is the hardest word to define, but also the most important. It doesn't mean being nice. Nice means pleasant and agreeable, which are fine qualities in most normal situations but useless in others. Kindness, on the other hand, means something much more profound. It is the right orientation in literally _every_ circumstance. But how could kindness be the right response to evil?

---

It is always possible to see the Light in others — including those who convincingly seem not to have any. Doing so is far more important than you can imagine. Why?

---

Compassion — especially for "bad people" — is profoundly misunderstood. It turns out it's a _motivated_ misunderstanding. There's something our minds don't want us to see.

---

Why do wise people urge compassion for evildoers? They're not telling us to be _nice._ They see something that we don't.

Why do wise people urge compassion for evildoers? Are they being naive? Or have we misunderstood what compassion is?

---

We've all heard that "hate cannot drive out hate," but is it really true? What about something milder, like contempt? Surely contempt for _bad people_ can make the world a better place — certainly more so than being kind to them.

---

There is a place deep within your mind that you can turn to know whether your intentions are pure.

---

## Angle 4: The Grand Conspiracy (Grounded in Systemic Suspicion)

---

Looking at the state of the world, one could be forgiven for believing that there's an _evil global conspiracy_ pulling the strings from behind the scenes. In a certain sense, there actually is.

It is the reason why, despite vast amounts of human ingenuity, many of our most pressing problems seem only to be getting worse—the collapse of our biosphere; degradation of our social fabric; intensification of the climate crisis; etc. All the cleverness in the world cannot save us as long as it keeps being usurped by a foe that we can scarcely comprehend.

---

## Angle 5: The Aphoristic Statement (Short, Provocative Hooks)

---

It is not possible to calculate your way to goodness.

---

Why is it so hard to defeat the evil in the world? What if nearly everything we're doing to "fight" it is secretly strengthening it?

---

If you wish to defeat the evil in the world, you must first defeat the evil in your own mind. Why?

---

Is it possible to fight evil without losing our humanity? And why _shouldn't_ we lose it? What could be wrong with using a bit of darkness to combat the darkness?
