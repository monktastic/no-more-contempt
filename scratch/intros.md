When we encounter darkness in the world, we feel morally licensed — obliged, even — to sprinkle in a little of our own. We are just giving them a taste of their own medicine or... something.

Why do wise people urge compassion for evildoers? They're not telling us to be _nice._ They see something that we don't.

---

There is a darkness deep within our minds that convincingly masquerades as the Light. It tricks us into violently attacking the darkness in others, which only strengthens both of ours. It is an _insanely_ clever trap.

The more you unmask this deception in yourself, the more you enable others to do the same. This is the only way to extinguish evil instead of creating more. It is the only path toward the more beautiful world our hearts most deeply long for.

---

Why are we unkind to people who we perceive as "bad"? The answer seems obvious: we do it to make the world a better place. But this is an insidious lie. It explains why we're not _nice_, but not why we're not _kind_. Nice is about being pleasant and agreeable, which are surely unhelpful in some situations. But kindness means something much deeper. It is the right motivation in _every_ circumstance.

---

We think that hating "bad people" is a sign of the good within us, but it's actually a sign of something _much darker_. All the hostility we've ever poured into the world still lives out there somewhere, where we judge it from afar, blissfully unaware of our own connection to it. But part of us always knows — and we cannot have the more beautiful world we desire until we acknowledge this and clean it up.

---

What if nearly everything you're doing to "fight evil" is secretly strengthening it — and moreover, what if part of you already knows this, but is actively concealing it from your conscious mind?

---

It feels really good to _stick it_ to "bad people," doesn't it? Why is that? It's not for the reason you probably think.

---

Have you ever had the experience of harshly judging someone for their behavior, only to later discover something about them that made you feel sorry for having done so?

What if I told you that it is _always_ possible to discover this in people — and that, moreover, an aspect of your mind can already see it?

You might think I'm exaggerating or being naive — that _intrinsically bad_ people exist, and contempt is helpful or even necessary in dealing with them. But this is a dark lie. 

---

We've all heard that "hate cannot drive out hate," but is it really true? How about something a little milder, like _contempt_? Can that make the world a better place?

It's easy to convince ourselves that it can. After all, what could possibly be wrong with feeling a little contempt for _bad people?_ It's not just okay, but practically our responsibility as decent people.
