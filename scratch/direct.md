[This is why there is **nothing** more primally, viscerally satisfying than violently punishing evil.]

It's the same feeling people have when committing genuine atrocities. The darker the behavior, the more it **must** be disguised as righteousness to make us feel okay about it.

But why specifically righteousness?

Because deep down, we *want* to obey our better nature—so *that* is the thing our darkness must imitate to get us to listen to it.

> *And no wonder, for even Satan masquerades as an angel of light.* — 2 Corinthians 11:14

But if it masquerades so well, is there any reliable way to tell the difference?

---

There is no way to detect whether you're in this state by thinking harder about it—because the very essence of it is that your thinking mind has been hijacked in service of rationalization.

Let that sink in.

There is **no way** to figure out if you're being evil by thinking harder about it; to tell if your mind has been compromised by *the darkness*.

And yet our thinking minds are the **only** thing we trust as a civilization.

Why might that be? Which part of us would benefit from enforcing that norm?

---

While treating you with contempt, one part of me knows I'm spreading darkness—doing my "dirty work"—while another part is kept squeaky clean. What does that remind you of?

*Plausible deniability.*

When groups of people, blissfully unaware of this capacity in themselves, form organizations—what is the natural result?

Corporations that "don't know" what their lobbyists do, governments that "don't know" what their intelligence agencies do, executives that "don't know" what their subsidiaries do.

None of it requires explicit coordination or top-down enforcement by mustache-twirling villains. It's the **inevitable result** of our individual blind spots, scaled up.

There *is* a kind of coordination at play, but it's not the kind we're used to imagining. It takes place beneath the surface of our normal conscious thresholds.

In the same way that my contempt for you is a kind of "secret handshake," there are countless similar exchanges of darkness going on **all the time** between us.

Every time any one of us skirts our conscience for any reason—say, by shaving off a little extra for ourselves, justifying it as "sticking it to the man"—we are secretly inviting others into that same dark space. And I don't mean this in some abstract sense. If you look carefully enough into your mind in such a moment, you cannot fail to notice it. The problem is that we **don't look.**

The sum total of all this hidden dark activity is the giant, seemingly-coordinated mass of darkness that is devouring our world.

The "bad people" are simply where this dark activity has accumulated most strongly.

The darkest idea of all is that if we were to round them all up and exterminate them, the rest of us would finally live in peace. The profound confusion required to even formulate this idea (let alone execute it) would **ensure** that the darkness remained in our world, simply changing shape.

---

Why is humanity destroying nature with such wanton abandon?

It's because we've lost the perception of our profound connection to it; its *sacredness.*

It's the same shielding I must use to treat you with contempt, or that people use when committing atrocities.

It's all one thing.

My contempt for the people destroying the rainforests—it is destroying the rainforests.

---


[Three levels]


This is why we **must** believe that "evil people" aren't merely confused; aren't just stuck in a (much) deeper version of the same trap that we are. Because then we'd see that our hatred for them is only a manifestation of the darkness within us, and that's the very last thing we want to see.



---



Well, we only dehumanize others to avoid feeling something we otherwise would—namely, our shared humanity. It requires an active process of shielding. And you instinctively know that the only reason people do that is to avoid feeling the full weight of any harm they may cause.

But what harm am I causing?

I'm making you more likely to dehumanize others—and a deep part of me knows that. 

Does contempt ever make anyone better? Of course not. It only ever makes them worse.

I'm throwing you under the bus for my own ego.

But I don't realize this because of the story I'm telling myself, about how *righteous* my behavior is.

But wait: I said that part of me *did* know it, and now I'm saying I "didn't realize it."

Which is it? Was it intentional or not?

---

Have you ever done something you knew was wrong at the time, but couldn't admit it to yourself until later? Maybe you made a cruel comment to boost your ego, took credit for someone else's work, or cheated on a test (or even partner). 

How could you both "know it was wrong" and "not admit it to yourself?"

That knowledge was *compartmentalized*. It wasn't unconscious, because it was there to see if you looked. It was consciously available—you just *chose not to look.*

It's a bizarre, paradoxical schism of mind in which you both know and yet don't—a kind of limbo state—and as we'll see, it's the secret mechanism behind *all the evil there ever was.*

It's the same state I have to be in to treat you with contempt. On one hand, part of me knew my behavior would result in a net darker world; one with more animosity. But I told myself it would be your fault if that happened, because everyone knows that hating bad people is *righteous.*

The problem is, you could recognize this split consciousness from the outside. How?

Try and recall what it's like to be on the receiving end of a dehumanizing gaze. Doesn't it feel like the other person is somehow absent or "turned away" from themselves? What you're noticing is that limbo state—and it's the same "off" feeling you were sensing in me.

That's how you knew I was up to no good, even if you couldn't put your finger on why. And you could sense that I knew it myself, even if I was playing dumb—making it feel like utter hypocrisy.

And somewhere deep down, I could sense the truth in your accusation—but owning up to it would reveal me as the bad actor—and so I was forced to double down. But you sensed that deceit, too, confirming your accusation. You *knew* you had me, forcing me double down harder...

---

The result is a kind of hall-of-mirrors effect, in which we both know what's happening, but there's no way for you to name it without sounding crazy. And what does that do to you?

It destroys your faith in humanity, by confirming your worst fears—that at the end of the day, we're all willing to abandon our better nature for the right price. And if so, why should you be the lone chump blindly following yours?

*Fuck that.* Two can play at this game.

I've just made you more likely to abandon your own better nature in the future—not just with me, but in general.

---

Here's the core problem.

A deep part of me knows how to fight evil without accidentally creating more. It's that same part we just called our "better nature." The problem is, doing this requires me to forgo that delicious hit of self-righteousness of proving myself *better* than you—and I'm not yet ready to give that up.

Can you think of a time when someone corrected you with integrity, without sneaking in contempt? Wasn't there something different about it?

Even if it stung your ego; made you lose face, did you have any desire to take revenge?

No—and it's not because they were being nice. Maybe they were even *more* fierce than I just was. Still, you could tell they were serving something beyond themselves, couldn't you? And even if it didn't change your behavior immediately, a certain seed was planted.

It's like they were seeing something in you that you'd forgotten about yourself.

What is that?

So I *know* this is possible—but instead of doing it, I tried to have my cake and eat it, too. Namely, to correct your misbehavior and still get to feel morally superior for it.

But as much as I want that to be possible, I know it's not. To do it, I must *abandon* my better nature. I tell myself that you can't see this from the outside. Intentions don't matter, only actions do!

But at some level, I know that's a lie, too—that you could sense from my tone, my gaze, etc., that I was taking the low road.

And on one level, of course I don't want you to know this. I'm not proud of it. But on the other hand, how else am I supposed to get that ego boost I secretly crave? It *requires* you to see that I've abandoned my better nature—*and* that part of me knows it—because it's that maddening hypocrisy that ultimately convinces you to abandon your own.

---

Here's what's going on.

Part of me wants to prove itself better, more deserving, etc. than others. So it finds clever ways to *reveal* itself to others—thus inviting them to become the kind of person I'm "better than." But for this to work, it must hide itself perfectly from me.

That "turned away" look you see in "bad people"—the same one you saw in me when I treated you with contempt—is this part of them showing itself to you while hiding itself from them. It feels righteous from the inside and looks evil from the outside. It is the same state that enables genuine atrocities.

When we are in it, we both know it and don't. And we *reveal* that we both know it and don't—while *knowing* that we're revealing it while also not knowing that...

And it is this recursive, paradoxical quality of the state that enables us to spread evil without realizing that we are.

Except that part of us does.

And *because* part of us does—and this goes firmly against our deepest nature—we're forced to hide it from ourselves.

How?

By hating the "bad people"—thus revealing it to them, while hiding it from ourselves... 

---

Every one of us instinctively recognizes this, even if we haven't put it together consciously before. That's the only reason it works—why I can reveal my "dark side" through subtle signals.

And yet we haven't really codified this knowledge as a society, have we?

Why not?

Well, what part of us stands to benefit from keeping it hidden?

Where would our dark parts have left to hide if we were forced to give up this most clever way of hiding them?

Could it be that our collective self-deception is actively strategizing to keep itself hidden?

---

Let me give you a taste of how this might work.

When I treated you with contempt, part of my mind was doing my "dirty work"—strategizing to draw you into darkness—while another part kept its hands clean. What does that remind you of?

*Plausible deniability.*

And what do you get when groups of people, unable to recognize this dark pattern in themselves, form organizations?

[...]

And what do I feel when I—unaware of my own susceptibility—see the horrible people who are doing this, and obviously doing it knowingly?

*Contempt*.

Which I make sure all my "allies" feel, too.

Who then form righteous organizations to fight those *evil* organizations...

---

There really is an *evil global conspiracy*, but it's not any of the ones we normally imagine (if we do).

The belief that I'm the righteous one standing outside the conspiracy, valiantly fighting it—that *is* the conspiracy.

---







I've just made the world a slightly darker place for my own benefit—but I must never admit this to myself, because look what it would entail.

Deep down, I don't *want* to cause harm, but sometimes I mess up. I confuse my *actual* better nature with that voice in my head *pretending* to be—that voice of rationalization.

But if that's true of me, maybe it's true of you, too.

Which would mean I've just caused genuine harm to you—made it easier for you to make that same mistake, which you don't ultimately want to be doing.

But the problem is that this isn't new information to me. Part of me sensed it even as I was doing it. That's the "shared humanity" I had to hide from myself. Why would I have to hide it unless at some level I already suspected it was true?

Which means that I've *knowingly* caused genuine harm for my own benefit.

And what do I call the kind of people who do that?

I couldn't possibly be one of them.






This one little dynamic contains the distilled essence of *all the evil there ever was.*

That may seem like a bold claim, but follow me here.

I just caused you genuine harm—drove you further from your better nature—while telling myself it was righteous.

But deep down, I'm not a bad person. I don't *want* to cause harm or act against my better nature—I only want to do right by the world.



---







The truth is, I could have predicted this would happen. Does contempt ever make anyone better? Of course not. And yet I did it anyway. Why?

Because I get something out of it—namely, to feel morally superior to you.

And you could sense this even as I was doing it, couldn't you? That I wasn't acting from completely noble intentions?

That's what made you dig in—which is *why* I now get to feel morally superior to you.

Isn't that interesting? I *wanted* something to happen, and you *sensing* that I wanted it was enough to actually make it happen. That's obviously not a coincidence.

But there's another wrinkle here.

See, you didn't just sense that I wanted it—you sensed that I wasn't being entirely honest with myself about it. Try and recall what that's like.

Why would I need to hide it from myself?

Well, think about it: if I were completely honest (and upfront) about wanting you to dig in your heels, would you do it?

Of course not.

In fact, even if I never let *you* know, the simple fact of *me* knowing would have spoiled it. I don't get to feel superior if I know that I'm the one provoking you.

So I *must* hide it from myself for the ruse to work—and you must *sense* that I'm hiding it.

But how can you sense something that I barely know about myself?

And moreover, I hinted that it was intentional.



I know I'm provoking you while pretending not to know—and that's what provokes you.

It is a **self-referential trap**—which means there's no specific thing you can point to and say "see, there's the provocation" or "there's the harm." The hidden intention to provoke **is** the provocation.

And this lack of hard evidence to point to—despite it being true, and you knowing it perfectly well—is itself part of the trap. Because you can see that I know this, too—that if you try to name what's happening, I'll just use it against you.

There's a dizzying, recursive, hall-of-mirrors feeling to the whole thing, which is why it works.

---

But notice how strange this is.

I secretly wanted something, and "just happened" to bring about the intricate set of conditions that would make it happen. Does that sound accidental to you?

On the other hand, how could it be intentional? Just look at what needs to happen.

You have to see something that I'm hiding from myself... and moreover, see *that* I'm hiding it from myself.

But how can that possibly be?

Try this. Think of a time you did something you knew was wrong, but couldn't admit it to yourself until later. Maybe you made a cruel comment to boost your ego, took credit for someone else's work, or cheated on a test (or even partner). 

How could you "know it was wrong" and also "not admit it to yourself"?

Do you remember what that was like? It requires a kind of *split consciousness.* Part of you knows something, but you're avoiding looking at it. The knowledge isn't unconscious. It's just *hidden*.

What's happening is that you're abandoning your better nature in favor of rationalizations. It is a state that you know you're in, but won't *let* yourself know you're in.

And this state has a certain "look" to it. If you've ever been on the receiving end of a dehumanizing gaze, you know what it's like. Doesn't the person seem *absent* or somehow *turned away* from themselves? That's what you're seeing.

At some level, we *know* it's visible when we're in it. If I were feeling pure malice toward you, this visibility wouldn't matter. But for contempt, your seeing it is part of what makes it work.



The knowledge of my ruse isn't unconscious. If it were, I couldn't adapt it in real time to your responses—which I do. And I'd be confused or embarrassed if you called me out—which I'm not.

Part of me is *knowingly* doing this while hiding it from full conscious awareness—and you can sense this. And when I see that you sense this, I'm forced to hide it harder—which you can also sense.

If I looked carefully, I would see that I've abandoned my better nature. That part of me knows that this will only increase the "net animosity" in the world, but I'm convincing myself otherwise.

I don't have to do anything "extra" to turn it into a ruse. Simply by maintaining that state, it becomes one.

---

The reason this works so well is that I can "genuinely" tell myself I did nothing wrong. After all, where exactly is the "wrong"? Point to it!

Using stern words isn't wrong. Judging bad behavior isn't wrong. So where's the harm?

The harm is showing you that even the so-called "good people" will abandon their better nature when they can get away with it. Part of you *wants* to believe in genuine goodness, and I'm robbing you of that.

Which makes you wonder why you should be the lone chump expected to follow *your* better nature.

*Fuck that.*

Now for another turn of the screw.

Part of me knew that even as I was doing it. I *needed* you to drift further from your better nature—because how else am I supposed to feel *inherently superior* to you?

It's not enough that you just occasionally make bad decisions. Everyone does that.

No. I need to know that the darkness lives only *out there* and not in me. And I'm making damn sure that I never have to second-guess it.

---

I am actively preventing someone from finding their way back to the Light.

Remember that part of me is *conscious* of this. And what do I call people who know perfectly well the harm they're causing and do it anyway?

I can't be one of them.

Which means I must bury the knowledge of my wrongdoing at **all costs**.

Which is exactly how they do what *they* do.

---

Perhaps you already see the punchline.

I viciously judge "bad people" not because I think I'm inherently superior to them, but because I know I'm not—and this is the best way to keep that knowledge hidden from myself.

And there's no limit to how far I will push it.

Notice how there's **nothing** more primally, viscerally satisfying than violently punishing evil.

Recall how *righteous* it feels.

The further I push you down this path, the better it feels to push you *further*—and the more confident I become that I'm the *good guy*.

---

Have you ever been on the receiving end of a dehumanizing gaze? Doesn't the person seem *absent* or somehow *turned away* from themselves?

A more extreme version of this is what we call "evil." And a milder version is what you saw in me when I treated you with contempt.

You're looking at split consciousness.

That's what the darkness *is.*









You see, although I feel dismayed by your reaction, part of me is secretly pleased that you really are the bad person I thought you were—and you can sense this satisfaction, can't you?

In fact, you could sense something "off" right from the start.

Compare it to a time when someone corrected you with integrity, without sneaking in contempt. Wasn't there something different about it?

Even if it stung your ego; made you lose face, did you have any desire to take revenge?

No—and it's not because they were being nice. Maybe they even had to be *more* fierce than I just was. But you could tell they were serving something beyond themselves, couldn't you?

What is that?

---

That "off" feeling you were sensing in me—it was the fact that part of me *wanted* to be proven right about you.



---



You see, deep down, I only want to do right by the world. And at some level, I know this is true of you, too. 

Which means that when I judge you for being bad—not just that you've done something bad, but that you *are* bad—I'm actually lying to myself. But for what purpose?

Well, part of me *wants* you to dig in, because then I get a delicious hit of self-righteousness.

And you can sense this, can't you? The weaponized hypocrisy?

I'm throwing you under the bus for my own ego—and there's no way you're going to let me get away with that.

---

Do *I* know I'm doing this?

Well, yes and no. If I knew it *fully*, it would defeat the whole purpose. So here's the story I'm telling myself:

> *My intentions don't matter; only my actions do. And since I'm fighting evil, it doesn't matter how anyone feels about it.*

The problem is, this is pure rationalization—and it's the *rationalizing itself you're sensing.* When people genuinely act from their better nature—the part that only wants to do right by the world—they don't look like this.

[...]

It's like they were reminding you of something about yourself—something you'd temporarily forgotten. And even if your behavior didn't change immediately, that planted a seed, didn't it?

What were they reminding you of?

What was I trying to make you forget?

These two forms of correction can be made to look nearly identical from the outside, and yet you can sense which is which. And while both may pause your misbehavior, they produce drastically different long-term effects.

---

On some level, I know this.

And you can see that I know it. That's what gives it that "weaponized hypocrisy" flavor. I'm choosing the option that produces harm while ensuring it looks righteous.

Something in me is making sure that my contempt leaks out—through my tone, my gaze, etc.—while keeping my conscious mind in the dark about it. Because if I were fully conscious of it, it wouldn't work: when I felt the weight of your accusation, I would suspect the truth in it, and the ruse would quickly collapse. It **must** remain partially hidden from me to maintain the facade.

And yet it isn't exactly unconscious, either. The unconscious mind doesn't coordinate such precise attacks and adapt them in real-time to your responses. More importantly, you can actually learn to watch your conscious mind doing this through close enough attention.

This ruse requires a kind of *split consciousness*: one part of me is doing my dirty work, while another part is kept clean.

Plausible deniability.

And it is this *split consciousness* that you're detecting from the outside, letting you know I'm rationalizing. 

(And because the ruse depends on you detecting it, part of me is showing it to you while hiding it from myself—which is another layer of split. What you're actually seeing is the full recursive structure, giving it a vertiginous hall-of-mirrors effect: I'm showing you that I know while pretending that I don't, and showing you that combination while pretending not to, etc. **That's** what makes it so maddening. Full details in footnotes.)

---

There's another way to look at this.

By choosing the "low road," I was abandoning my *better nature*. And no matter how hard I convinced myself that I wasn't, or that it was for a good reason ("sometimes you gotta fight fire with fire..."), the result was that it lured you away from yours—which I then had to blame you for, because I had "no idea" I caused it.

But I *did* cause it—and a deep part of me knows it.

And consider all the downstream effects of having darkened your mind, of which there will surely be many. I'm partially responsible for those, too.

But when I stop to analyze my effect on the world, I'll never take any of that into consideration. All I will see is that I stopped you. Everything else I'll either ignore or blame on you—if I could even see it, which I can't.

Which means that the vast majority of the effects of my behavior will be invisible to "objective analysis."

There's a deep part of me that knows this, but will never allow it into the light of consciousness. Because what I'm getting from it isn't just proving you bad.

You see, there are dark parts of myself that I'm not quite ready to confront.

And having a darker world helps me avoid having to face them.

---

Allow me to switch to a more mystical register.

The part of me that lures me away from my better nature with rationalizations, then leaks out of my mind and into yours—call it *the darkness.*

If I could see it for what it was—I mean really, truly see it—could I want it? Would I let it live in me?

Hell no.

It must evade my consciousness in a certain sense—and yet it must still *leverage* it to do its dirty work.

When you look into the eyes of a truly "bad" person: don't they seem absent, or somehow  "turned away" from themselves?

That's what you're looking at. It's as if something *else* has taken control—the *same* thing that takes control of me when I treat you with contempt.

And you can see that I know this, even if I'm not admitting it to myself. It robs you of faith in our better nature—all the more so because you can see that I know I'm doing this. 

This world really is the dark, soulless place you feared. You have no choice but to embrace your own darkness for protection.

And that is how the darkness wins its mythical battle against the Light. Not primarily through big, flashy encounters like in the storybooks—but through the countless tiny choices we make to abandon our better nature when we think it couldn't possibly make a difference.

---

The darkness — it wins by imitating the Light.

We never recognize it for what it is when it's inside us. It always feels *righteous.*

Yet we easily notice it in *other people*—whom we feel morally compelled to either fight (if they're our "enemies") or join (if they're our "allies"). Yet both ways only spread more darkness.

That person who corrected you with integrity—you were allied in Light, even if you were enemies on the surface.

And when I treated you with contempt, we were allied in darkness.



It is *infectious*—and yet there are no objectively verifiable signs of the infection.

This is why we are unable to defeat the darkness in the world. By its very design, none of us recognizes it in ourselves. We're always certain we're the *good guys.*

---

Consider all the "unfortunate byproducts" of grand human projects. Are they really unforeseeable? Or could it be that many of those projects are rooted in secretly self-serving desires that we convince ourselves couldn't *possibly* have any affect on the outcome—and yet which everyone senses anyway, giving them tacit permission to skirt *their* consciences, ...

The "plausible deniability" that we each engage in—where the right hand doesn't know what the left is doing—might it naturally scale up to the organizations we create? [...]

And when we see this maddening behavior—where they *obviously* know they're causing harm, but are unwilling to own up to it—what do we feel for the uniquely evil people responsible?

*Contempt*, perhaps?

[the impossible subtlety]

---

When people's faith in our *better nature* is destroyed, how do they treat other people? Animals? Nature at large?

Aren't they more likely to overlook the life in *all* of it; to objectify it; use it for their own benefit?

By robbing us of faith in the Light, it is robbing us of *wonder.* Of the recognition of the profound miracle we all live in. Of *life itself.*

That's what the darkness ultimately is: a life-denying, life-destroying force.

Under its oppressive weight, there is no option but for our biosphere to progressively collapse.

---

This is why solutions that



Lest you think the solution is to simply incorporate the "subjective facts" into our objective calculations, consider that we'll never take into consideration something that we're hiding from ourselves. Nor can we simply ignore it as a "rounding error." In this case of my contempt for you, the long-term outcome is likely **dominated** by how it impacted your mind.

I've eroded your faith in humanity. When you and commit an act that reflects your newfound cynicism, am I going to include that in my calculations—even if part of me knows I caused it? Of course not.

Paradoxically, the reason we believe we can simply think our way out of this mess is that we **know** we can't. We know it will continue to license us to engage in our self-serving behaviors. Or, put another way, the dark aspect of our minds knows that this lie is the only way it can continue to survive. 

We cannot think our way out of this because our thinking minds are designed to keep us trapped in it—that is, as long as they continue to be unmoored from the deeper part of us that knows.

What is this deeper part of us? Let's revisit a line from the opening:

> *Deep down, I only want to do right by the world. And at some level, I know this is true of you, too.*

That same part of me knew that contemning you would lead to a darker world, but I convinced myself I couldn't hear it. Why? Because it doesn't speak in rational thought—and modern culture has trained us to **only** trust rational thought.

Ask yourself: which part of our minds would have an incentive to create a culture where the only thing we trust is the part of ourselves that cannot identify when we've fallen under the sway of the darkness? Where even the *idea* would be discarded as "woo"?

I have every incentive to help you hide your darkness from yourself, and vice versa.

---

When we're confronted with darkness, our ability to resist falling under its sway ourselves depends on our ability to recognize it as an infection. And as best I can tell, that in turn depends on how thoroughly we've evicted it from our own minds.

Which means that to whatever degree I haven't done "the work," I'm almost certainly engaging in countless subtle forms of darkness without ever realizing it; each one further darkening the world, even as I'm flawlessly convinced I'm helping.

[Lone chump. Stealing the light.]

[Urge to violently punish evil]

[Ever been corrected without contempt?]

---

So how do we defeat it?

Well, what is it that lives *beneath* the infection? 



---








Deep down, I only want to do right by the world. Another way to say this is that *the true nature of mind is compassion*. 

The only way I can cause harm is due to a kind of confusion, in which I've drifted from my true nature. The weird thing about that state is that I don't realize when I'm lost in it. 

Well, I do and I don't. Part of me knows it *perfectly well*, but it feels so damn righteous that I convince myself I don't.

To get a taste of this, notice how there's **nothing** more primally, viscerally satisfying than violently punishing evil. This bloodthirsty state couldn't be further from genuine compassion—from my authentic desire to be of service—and yet when I'm lost in it, it feels like the *true* "righteousness."

Deep down, I know that you, too, can only cause harm when lost in the same kind of confusion—which means that seeing you as *fundamentally defective* is a lie. It's actually a sign that *I myself* have drifted from my true nature, but I'm not ready to admit this to myself. Why? Because I'm lost in the righteous feeling of punishing you.

But you're not fooled. You can tell I'm doing the very thing I'm judging you for—even if you can't quite name it. So you implicitly accuse me of hypocrisy. And I sense the truth in your accusation, but if I were to reveal it—*even to my own conscious mind*—I would be in **deep** trouble. Because I would realize, to my horror, that I'm under the sway of the very thing I claim to be fighting.

So I must resist your accusation *at any cost*. But this only makes you **more** confident that you've got me pinned down—which I must resist harder, making it more obvious that I'm lost...

You feel this as a dizzying hall-of-mirrors effect that tests your sanity; chips away at your faith in humanity. No matter how "bad" you may be, part of you wants to believe in genuine goodness—our true nature—because it's what you ultimately are. But I'm making it very hard for you. Maybe it's just a myth after all, and we're all just performing.

*(Those with a strongly analytical bent may appreciate this breakdown of what's happening.)*

And if that's true, why should you bother listening for your own? *Fuck that*. If this is how the world wants it, then this is how the world will get it.

A deep part of me knows it caused this. And that's exactly why I must never admit it to myself. No: **you** are the problem.

---

Here's another way to look at what happened.

By drifting from my own better nature, I allowed something "else" to take control. Something *dark.* And when it did, it expressed itself through my tone, my gaze, etc. You felt it, didn't you? Almost like it was revealing itself to you, beneath my words and actions.

Even if I managed to temporarily suppress your misbehavior, *that* is what ultimately had the greatest impact on you.

But because I "don't realize" I was acting as its vehicle, I find this accusation preposterous. I can only assume you're projecting—which means you're revealing your *own* darkness.

*Shit*, this world is even worse than I thought—making it even easier for me to confuse my self-righteous judgement for my better nature in the future.

---

*The darkness*—it lured me away from my better nature, sneaked out of my mind, and lured you away from yours. In doing so, it robbed a bit of light from this world. And it did all this because it recognized itself in you when *you* misbehaved.

Why am I anthropomorphizing it?

In one sense, it's obviously me. Part of me knew I was doing this, and I did it anyway. I'm certainly responsible for the harm it causes—*including any downstream effects of having darkened your mind* (which there are sure to be).

But in a very important sense, it is *not* me. It's not my "true nature." If I were **fully aware** of its presence, I simply wouldn't want it. *Couldn't* want it.

That's what allows the darkness to survive: it disguises itself as our true nature. As *us*.

When people are committing atrocities, they're *sure* they're doing the right thing. Yet from the outside, it's obvious to us that they're... *possessed?*... by something.

In that moment, we have a choice: to either recognize what's really going on, or else to perceive that darkness as *intrinsic* to them. If we choose the latter, we cannot help but create more darkness in the world, while flawlessly convinced we're helping.

But here's the hardest part to confront.

Part of us *always* recognizes what's really going on—but we sense that we can get away with pretending otherwise.

Why would I *want* to pretend?

Because I don't want to face the fact that darkness lives in me—that I'm susceptible to the very thing I hate in others. And the easiest way to delay facing it is to create **more darkness** in the world. That way, I can always point to others and say *"See! It's only in **them**!"*

When I look at the "bad people," part of me *knows* they're only lost in a deeper version of the same confusion I am—and that's exactly why I must never admit it. They're the only people for whom it's still socially acceptable to unleash my darkness.

They're the place we store our own unacknowledged shadows.

This is a truth that we all know deep down. And it's the very last thing anyone is allowed to say out loud, lest the jig be up.

---

There's a kind of shared secret at play here. I hide my darkness in my enemies, and they hide theirs in me. It's a kind of *quid pro quo*.

We think we're fighting, but we're not. Any time either of us makes the world darker, it helps both of us hide better from our true nature. Isn't that true? A darker world makes it easier for *everyone* to justify skirting their conscience, because it's not their fault. In fact, I'm not "skirting" anything! I'm just behaving as any rational, self-interested actor should!

In this way, all the darkness in the world is intimately connected; each one triggering all the rest.

When I'm dark, I embolden the darkness in both my "allies" and "enemies." The outer form looks very different, of course—providing the compelling illusion that we're valiantly fighting each other—but under the surface, we're secretly fighting for the same "team."

We've begun to sense this as a society—that something is playing us off each other, as cover for something dark. So we turn our attention to whoever that is—the elites—and aim our righteous contempt at them.

We're recreating the same confused dynamic at a more subtle level. How much longer before we realize that *the darkness itself* is the one "pulling the strings?"

This is a subtle point, so I want to be clear. There really **are** people lost in the darkness who must be fought fiercely. They exist on our team, the other team, and probably even more commonly amongst the "elites"—who really *are* playing us off each other.

The problem isn't fighting them. It's that we haven't yet admitted that our contempt is the very thing keeping the whole game alive—that even the elites are ultimately pawns in a game that we ourselves are playing. They represent the strongest concentration of our collective shadow.

Violently punishing them feels **great**—because that newly created darkness will ensure that one more takes their place, who we will then get to violently punish even harder. Then we can all wring our hands even harder at the sorry state of the world, providing even better cover for our own innocent misbehaviors.

*This dark world forced my hand, after all.*

And I'm not claiming to be above it all, or to have special or unique qualities here. I'm just as lost as anyone else.

But that sense of being the one standing outside "the conspiracy," valiantly fighting it? That **is** the conspiracy.

Nothing will bring it down until we confront this.

[Despite proving it's good, it results in a bad outcome. Ends justify means because part of our mind is overlooking ends. Blind spot.]

[It is revealing itself to you while hiding itself from me.]

[Unprovability.]

[The closest analogy I can find is this. Think of a time when you did something you *knew* was wrong, but couldn't admit it to yourself until later. How could you "know it was wrong" and also "not admit it to yourself"? The knowledge lived in a kind of limbo state—conscious but hidden.]

[When I'm in it, you can sense that I'm *hiding from myself* in a certain sense; from my deepest nature. If you've ever been on the receiving end of a dehumanizing gaze, you know what that's like. Doesn't the other person seem absent, or somehow "turned away" from themselves?]

This is why, if I wish to defeat the evil "out there," there is literally no substitute for unearthing it in myself. Because if I don't, all I'm really doing is using it to justify my own while pretending I'm not.

The existence of "bad people" is what lets me get away with all manner of tiny misdeeds.

I know a day will come when I'm forced to own up to my

We're talking about the true nature of *consciousness*, and so that which I'm recognizing *in* you is also that which you are recognizing *with.* Thus, a recursion of sorts is set up: like two pairs of eyes gazing into each other, each sees that the other sees that the other sees, ad infinitum.

Thus, our nature is **common knowledge** (in the game-theoretic sense, more or less). Everyone knows that this is what we all are, deep down—and that everyone else knows that, etc. It is knowledge of our most fundamental equality.

This knowledge isn't fully conscious for most of us, exactly, but isn't unconscious either. It is *conscious-but-hidden*—and the more hidden it is, the less it *feels* like we know it.

Now because our true nature is common knowledge, it is *also* common knowledge that I'm lying to myself when I dehumanize you—and furthermore, we know that the only reason anyone does this is to cause harm (or benefit themselves) without feeling guilt.

And given the context of this interaction, the way I'm trying to benefit myself is obvious: I want that delicious hit of self-righteousness. Proof of my worldview; that I'm one of the good guys valiantly battling the hordes of evil.

So when I accuse you of being a bad person—that is, fundamentally defective—it's as though I were announcing out loud "I'm doing the very thing I'm accusing you of." Of *course* I know you know I know it, etc.—and I *want* you to know that. Because that's what will drive you mad—and I want you to know this, which is what drives you mad.

It is self-referential. I'm causing you harm by showing you my intention to cause the harm I am causing you.

I've caused you *actual harm*. I robbed you of faith in genuine goodness; drove you further from your better nature. Yet can you pin down the harmful thing I did? Using stern words isn't wrong. Nor is even *violence*, when wielded correctly.

The harm came from the entire recursive structure of the ruse. I caused you harm by showing you my intention to cause the harm I was causing you. 

And my doing it depended on a paradoxical state of mind. I had to be conscious enough to strategically provoke you, adapt my responses in real time, etc.; while also unconscious enough to "genuinely" not know that I was doing this (or else I couldn't use it against you).

The whole thing is unmistakable and yet impossible to prove. And this unprovability isn't a bug; it's what makes the whole thing work—because if you *could* prove it, it wouldn't be so maddening, would it? You could just point at what I did wrong and move on with life.

This is the core feature of the darkness: it **lives in the shadows**. That's what makes it so difficult to banish from our world.

Here's my hypothesis.

When I abandon my true nature—my "inner Light"—I powerfully invite others to do the same.

Look at the phenomenology of it. Deep down, I know it's possible to fight evil without contempt, and I can sense that it will be better for the world. But something in my mind lures me away from the Light with clever rationalizations of all the good it will do.

These rationalizations are *so tempting.* I might even be able to "prove" they're correct. Yet when I choose to follow them, I inevitably end up darkening the world as a whole.




That absent look you see in the eyes of "evil people"—it's the same thing that overtook me so that I could treat you with contempt. And by letting it take control, I ended up doing its bidding.
