Contempt: the last hiding place of evil

- Most forms of evil are _obviously_ evil today. Contempt (for "bad people") is unique in that we still pretend it's good. That's because from the outside, the resulting behavior looks very similar to something that _is_ genuinely good

If you find yourself calculating right from wrong, that's a good time to stop and look for self-deception. Not that calculation can't be helpful...

Everyone knows by now (I hope) that indiscriminately bombing your enemies is bad, not just for them, but for you: it creates more enemies (who are more justified). Contempt is like carpet-bombing the person's mind: you're not isolating the problem, which is their self-deception.
