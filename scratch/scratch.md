## Mockery, Shame, and Bears—Oh My!

Think back to a time when you mocked or shamed an enemy. You probably felt you were doing it to help—if not them, exactly, then at least the world. But if you’re honest, part of you secretly wanted them to dig in their heels, to prove themselves worthy of your contempt.

And they probably _did_—but not just because of what you said or did. It was because part of you was sending a hidden signal that said, roughly:

>You're *defective.*

Pause and see if you can recall conveying that, through body language, tone, or other subtle tells. You didn’t just want them to know how you felt; you wanted *them* to feel it too—and to see you savor it while appearing righteous. It's a complex, multi-layered signal that can be invisibly woven into almost any interaction—and often is.

What does it do to a person?

It robs them of a bit of faith in humanity; reminds them that the world is a dark place. It pushes them deeper into the pit of self-deception that already traps them, which we then mistake for pride or stubbornness.

But is it really a mistake? Or did part of us plan this, knowing that it would license us to escalate? Is it possible that our enemy sensed this right from the start, because it’s something every human does but cannot admit—as if the whole game depends on this feigned ignorance?

Maybe you're starting to sense how many layers of self-deception are operating here—and how our own willingness to enter that dark space secretly encourages others to do the same.

## The Medicine Journey

The mushrooms took me back to a more challenging situation.

I was confronted with someone I _knew_ was capable of change but was acting terribly. I knew better than to push them closer to the brink—so while I still opposed them with great force, part of me was subconsciously offering an olive branch that said:

>_You know what you're doing is wrong. I'm not going to let you do it, but you're always welcome back into the Light._

I could feel the fierce integrity of that message, and knew they could, too. It didn't fix things immediately, but a seed had been planted.

Then I was taken back to a different kind of moment—one where I was certain my enemy was beyond redemption. There was no other explanation for their behavior.

On the surface, my message was the same: _I will stop you._ I’d assumed I was acting with the same integrity.

But the medicine began to reveal hidden layers of deception. This time, the subtext was closer to:

>*I could offer you the same chance, but we both know you wouldn't take it. So let's cut to the chase: I'll pretend to give you that choice, while making sure you cannot take it.*

*Shudder.*

I had told myself this was the quickest way to get justice. I couldn't risk them using my kindness against me by offering them a real olive branch. So I offered a poisoned one instead, knowing it would make them entrench; exposing their evil faster. Same result, more efficient method. Sure, it was a bit underhanded, but I was *fighting evil*.

*How noble!* the medicine ribbed. *And how did you know they wouldn't accept a real one?*

What did it mean? They were *evil,* dammit! Couldn't it see that?

Another layer was peeled back.

I saw that I *didn't* know it. I *couldn't* know it. Why hadn't that been obvious? *Oh, no*.

It wasn’t that I _knew_ they were irredeemable—it was that part of me _needed_ them to be. And The best way to ensure that was to convince my conscious mind I’d offered them a genuine olive branch, so that their refusal looked like proof of moral failure.

That’s why I’d never seen even the first layer of my own deception. But there was more.

Part of me had _known_ I was perpetrating this ruse—and not only known it, but hinted at it, just enough for them to sense it. That subtle awareness made the whole thing even crueler, tightening the screws. The full message had really been closer to:

>*I don’t care if there’s some tiny part of you still trying to crawl back toward the light. I’m going to smother it so completely that nobody will ever think to look for it again.*

*No, no, no, no, no, no, no.*

It wasn't just *dark*—it was *malevolent.* And I don't use that word lightly. But it's what my mind had to do to feed its insatiable need to see others as evil.

In that moment, I saw how a fundamentally decent person—_me_—could commit genuine evil.  
I knew how that felt, and what it looked like from the outside.

_“Yes, yes,”_ the medicine whispered. _“And what else did you know?”_

One more layer peeled back.

_Oh, fuck._ No. It couldn’t be. It couldn’t. Fucking. Be.

It was **exactly** the same look I’d seen in _their_ eyes—the one I’d taken as proof they were evil. What I had actually been staring into was the cold gaze of countless layers of self-deception—the same gaze I had to don to perpetrate this very ruse.

But that would mean…

What I was doing to them was identical to what they were doing to others. 
The same mechanism. The same self-deception. 
The same willingness to harm while hiding from myself what I was really doing. 

*And part of me had always known it.*

[Don't forget to unpack the recursive spiral of HOW it worked.]

---

The mushrooms first took me back to a time when I had opposed someone whom I had *known* was redeemable. I saw that woven into my opposition was a hidden subtext that said something like:

>*You know what you're doing is wrong. I'm not going to let you do it, but you're always welcome back on the side of good.*

They then took me to a time when I had fought a more bitter rival—someone whom i'd *needed* to believe was beyond redemption. 

The surface message remained the same: *I won't let you do this*. But this time, the subtext was subtly, invisibly different. This time, it communicated:

>*I'm going to make it **look** like I'm giving you a chance, but we both know I'm not. I'm going to see to it that you suffer.*

*Shudder.*

I *knew* this dark message would force them to double down, making it look like they were freely choosing to reject my kind offer. Sure, this was a bit underhanded, but so what? It would get them to reveal their evil faster than if I'd offered them the *real* olive branch—so what difference did it make? In fact, it was *better* for the world.

Then the medicine peeled back another layer.

I saw that part of me wasn't totally sure they would refuse the real lifeline—and I couldn't risk them accidentally taking it. I had cornered a bit of *real evil* in the world, dammit, and I wasn't going to let the soft part of me get in the way of violently punishing it.

At the time, it had felt completely reasonable; even noble. But now it felt... evil?

I didn't *known* this person was fundamentally beyond redemption. How could I? And yet here I was, willing—no, eager—to shove them deeper into the abyss for my own satisfaction. What else would you call that? But then that would mean...

*Oh, shit.*

it meant I knew *exactly* how it was possible for a fundamentally decent person—me—to commit great evil. *All we have to do is hide it well enough from ourselves.*

*Yes, yes...* the medicine urged. *and are you just realizing this now?*

Another layer was peeled back. My stomach sank.

I had known it at the time, and still done it! What did that make me? But it got worse.

Not only had I been communicating a subtext with my dehumanizing gaze; they were sending me one right back—and it said, unmistakably:

>*How do you think I do what I do? But we already knew that, didn't we?* 

*No no no no no no no.* I didn't want to see what hid behind the last layer in my mind, but there it was.

I *had* always known it.

[It is the only way that ANYONE can commit evil. Then Liberation explains why.]

---

dropped:

This limbo state is the secret mechanism behind *all the evil there ever was.* Even the worst person can only cause harm by shielding their minds from perceiving the _life_ in their victims—that spark that would remind them of themselves—using essentially the same trick. 

---

The mushrooms took me back to a time when I had felt exactly that. One by one, it revealed layers of knowledge that I had hidden from myself.

On the surface, the message I was delivering was simple:

> *I'm going to oppose you by any means necessary.* 

That seemed healthy enough. I was giving them a chance to stop, and if they didn't take it, I would know everything I needed about them. But woven into it was a dark subtext:

>*You had your chance and blew it. I'm going to make it look like I'm giving you one last chance to repent, but I'm actually sealing off the exits to ensure you can't take it.*

*Shudder.*

I had somehow convinced myself that I was doing this for the greater good—and thus it wasn't *real* darkness. But I also knew they would *interpret* it as real—and that it would give them every reason to double down, giving me carte blanche to destroy them by any means necessary.

I told myself that the ends justify the means; that this tiny act of self-deception was ultimately worth the mark on my conscience. I was looking at *pure evil*, after all—and I wasn't about to let the soft part of me interfere with my chance to extinguish it.

But then I noticed something I hadn't caught before.

The cold, empty stare I was using to deliver this message—it was exactly the same gaze looking back at me. But why would I need to do that, unless... *oh, shit*. Part of me had known exactly what I was doing. In fact, I was secretly conveying:

>*You know that thing you do in your mind to let you harm innocent people? I'm doing it right now. Oh, you thought I didn't have it in me? Well surprise, motherf\*\*\*er.*

What was "that thing"? It was the decision to actively block off the perception of our shared humanity.

But why would I have to block it? If I already knew they were evil, there was nothing I should have had to block. That's when the medicine unveiled the final layer of deception.

I had *always* been able to perceive their inner Light, but had hidden it from myself. The message I was delivering was thus closer to:

>*We both know I can actually see your Light—and that your evil is a distorted cry for help. We both know I could lead you back toward your Light while still serving justice. But no one can prove that I know that—not even me—so I'm going to snuff it out instead, pretending I had no choice.*

*No, no, no, no, no, no, no.*

It wasn't just *dark*—it was *pure malevolence.* The concentrated essence of *all the evil there ever was.*

No wonder they had chosen to dig in their heels. No wonder I had needed to hide this from myself.



[This part of me couldn't just leave their response to chance. It needed to _ensure_ they would make the wrong choice.]




Two levels: (1) I'm hiding my darkness from myself because it's too horrible to face, (2) it's convincing me it's too horrible to face so that I will hide it from myself, and it knows that this will cause me to spread it to others. It's using me as a vehicle to spread itself.

The way it's preventing me from noticing this is by making me feel that I'm the one using *it* (in a strategic way, to fight evil). But this is a horrible lie.



---


You're probably not thinking this thought consciously. It's more like a vague sense of moral superiority. A background hum that says "I'm made of better stuff" or "they're just... different." But the darkness of the message gets through all the same.

Deep down, we _know_ this distinction. We know there's a way of opposing evil—fiercely, even violently; of _hating their behavior_ without forsaking _them_. We know this is likely to result in a much healthier outcome. But we also know that these two forms of opposition can be made to look nearly identical from the outside.

Which means we know that nobody could blame us for picking the "wrong one."

---

## The Hidden Knowledge

Not only can nobody _else_ blame us if we make the wrong choice; we will not even blame ourselves.

We _know_ the two forms of opposition send different signals, and we _know_ which is which. But we also know we can make them look similar enough on the surface that we can pretend—_even to ourselves_—that we don't see the difference.

This is the mechanism by which we can knowingly shove people deeper into darkness while _genuinely believing_ we were offering them a way out.

Psychologists call this the Fundamental Attribution Error: _we judge ourselves by our intentions and others by their behavior._ We see our contempt as righteous opposition—after all, we _mean_ well—while their contempt proves their evil nature.

And once you see this clearly, you realize something even more horrifying.

---

## All The Evil There Ever Was

This mechanism isn't unique to contempt or mockery. It's the secret engine behind _every harmful act in history._

The CEO knowingly polluting rivers, the politician starting wars on false pretenses, the billionaire hoarding wealth while people starve—they all operate through precisely this mechanism. Part of them knows. Always. The knowledge exists in limbo. They could choose to examine it. But they generate justifications: "Everyone does it." "It's for the greater good."

The CEO who ignores environmental harm tells themselves they're just doing their job. The politician who lies tells themselves everyone lies. The citizen who looks away tells themselves they're just one person.

Everyone has good reasons. Everyone is just responding to the world as it is.

Think about the Nazi who convinced himself Jews weren't really human. The knowledge that they _were_ human existed in limbo. He could have examined it. He chose not to.

**This mechanism—and only this mechanism—is what enables every atrocity.** Not monsters. Not people fundamentally different from you. Just humans who've learned to hide knowledge from themselves while appearing righteous.

And here's what broke me wide open: _I was using the exact same mechanism._

Which raised the most disturbing question of all...

---

## The Hidden Motive

But why on Earth would we want to do that?

It's so that we can continue to believe that all the problems of the world are caused by something fundamentally alien to us—the result of _inherently defective_ people whom we could never hope to understand, let alone help. Sure, we may commit little misdeeds here or there, but they're of a fundamentally different nature than the _real_ darkness that plagues our world.

To put it bluntly: we subtly but continually reinforce the evil "out there" to hide our own from ourselves. That is why we fail to defeat the evil in the world. Part of our minds is actively working against this goal.

Their evil is _not_ of a different nature. The subconscious message we deliver to "bad people" is made of **exactly** the same "stuff" that enables their misbehavior. Not only do they know this, but we know this, and we know they know this—which is why we know it will work. We are revealing our darkness because we know how they will receive it: as license to embrace theirs.

This creates a vicious spiral: We make others more evil so that we can hide our own darkness from ourselves. But the very act of making them more evil _requires_ us to hide our own darkness from ourselves. You can't push someone deeper into self-deception without entering that state yourself.

**In other words, contempt for evil people doesn't just fail to help—it IS the darkness it claims to fight.**

And as we shall soon see, these parts of our minds are not working independently. They're coordinating in ways that will seem impossible until you see them directly.

---

## The Medicine Journey

On that trip, the medicine showed me specific times I'd radiated contempt at people I considered evil, convinced I was righteously opposing them.

And this time, I couldn't hide from what was in limbo.

### I Was Making Them Worse

When I mocked or shamed these people, they didn't change. They dug in their heels. Got more extreme. More defensive.

I'd always told myself: "Well, that's because they're fundamentally defective."

But then the floor dropped out.

**I saw that I was trying to make them worse.** Not accidentally. _Actively trying._ Part of me wanted them to double down, to become more evil—because then I could feel even more self-righteous fury, the most intoxicating feeling in existence.

I was taken back to specific moments, and shown exactly where in my mind this knowledge had existed.

### I Wanted This Outcome

But why would I want to make them worse?

I saw that part of me desperately _wanted_ them to make the wrong choice. Because there was nothing more viscerally satisfying than watching evil be violently punished. And that satisfaction felt _righteous._ It felt like proof I was good.

The surface story: _I'm giving them one final chance to repent._

But underneath? I _needed_ them to fail. Because that proof would license me to unleash my darkness on them while calling it justice.

### I Engineered It

And then the medicine showed me something even more horrifying.

This part of me couldn't just leave their response to chance. It needed to _ensure_ they would make the wrong choice.

The solution was brilliant in its cruelty: I would pretend to offer them a genuine path back while secretly sealing off all the exits. I would make my "olive branch" and my "poisoned olive branch" look almost identical—so identical that even my own conscious mind couldn't tell the difference.

I could craft a message that would reliably trigger their worst impulses while giving me complete plausible deniability.

_"Sorry, I was only trying to help!"_

The shove was accomplished by merely telegraphing my intention to execute it—knowing they would receive the signal, knowing they would react, knowing I could claim ignorance.

My overt behavior appeared to be righteously combating their evil. But underneath, I was conveying:

_"I don't care if you really do have something good buried under unthinkable pain. I'm going to smother it so thoroughly that nobody ever thinks to ask whether you have it."_

It's a path that starts with mockery, with the back of our minds already harboring the idea of pushing them all the way to complete moral condemnation.

### We Share The Same Mechanism

And then I saw something that broke me completely.

To shove them deeper into plausible deniability, I had to enter it myself. To push them into the limbo state, I had to enter that exact same state.

They can only cause harm by using this mechanism—hiding knowledge, generating rationalizations, choosing not to look. And to push _them_ deeper into it, I had to use that identical mechanism.

We're both hiding from the same thing. Both using the same trick. Both capable of the same self-deception.

### I Could Always See Their Light

_"And what else?"_ the medicine nudged, relentless.

I saw that underneath their darkness—underneath all that self-deception and rationalization and harm—was something pure. Something confused. Something _reachable_.

I had always been able to perceive this. Not as a belief—as direct perception.

But then I noticed something else. Something eerie.

The darkness itself—the thing covering their Light—I had seen it before. Not something similar. The _same_ thing. Like recognizing someone's eyes across a crowded room. The same presence I'd encountered in others. The same presence I'd encountered in myself.

_This isn't something you're realizing now. It's something you've always known._

The veil was lifted retroactively. I _had_ always seen it.

Pure Light. Whose true nature is Love. Incapable of genuinely wishing harm.

The actual message I'd been conveying was:

_"We both know I can see your Light—that your evil is a distorted cry for help. We both know I could lead you back toward it. But no one can prove I knew that—not even me—so no one will blame me when I snuff it out."_

This wasn't just dark. It was pure malevolence—the very essence of evil.

I wasn't making a fundamentally defective person worse. I was knowingly shoving fundamentally innocent beings—badly confused people, identical to myself at the very deepest level—deeper into the abyss.

### The Liberation

And the moment you see it clearly—the moment this knowledge floods from limbo into full consciousness—something shifts at a fundamental level.

It feels very much like being freed from a demonic possession.

What I'd thought was "me"—the hatred, the contempt, the urge to crush evil—was actually a structure of self-deception masquerading as my identity. A parasite that had learned to think my thoughts and feel my feelings so convincingly that I'd mistaken it for myself.

**"Oh—this is not me."**

All those depictions of the angel and devil on our shoulders were almost right. Except the angel isn't some external guide—it's your true nature, what you actually _are_. And the devil isn't an equal opposing force—it's a parasite that can be evicted. They're not peers locked in eternal struggle.

The battle between good and evil is not symmetrical. The devil doesn't just whisper obviously-evil ideas in your ear—it speaks using your own voice, your own reasoning, your own sense of righteousness. The further you drift from your Light, the more easily you confuse the devil's voice for your own.

And then came the second revelation:

**"Oh—this is not them either."**

The people I'd hated, the ones I'd judged as fundamentally defective—they were in the same situation. The darkness couldn't possibly be their true self. It's a distortion, an infection, a forgetting.

The message was clear: _This is how it is possible for someone whose true nature is infinite Love—YOU—to commit great evil. This is exactly the same way they do it._

Then the medicine showed me one more thing—what this looks like from the other side.

It let me experience progressively drifting away from the Light, becoming increasingly confused, trusting more and more in the voice of darkness while mistaking it for my own wisdom. The parasite becoming so familiar it feels like home.

From this vantage point, I could see how people responded to me. When I was closer to my Light, people loved me—they saw something genuine. But as I drifted further, more and more people began to look at me with contempt, with that same cold judgment I had once directed at others.

I understood why. They were doing exactly what I had done—mistaking my darkness for my essence, feeling righteous about condemning it.

But a tiny handful of people never changed. Throughout the entire journey into darkness, their eyes conveyed something different. They opposed what I was doing—fiercely, without compromise. They would stop me, restrain me if necessary. But through it all, they never forsook _me_ to the enemy of the Light.

They weren't just refusing to let me misbehave. They were refusing to let the darkness claim another soul.

It was the Light itself acting through them—pure compassion in action. Not soft, not permissive, but absolutely unwilling to confuse the host with the infection.

When you witness one person refuse to give up on another, even as that person seems to descend into evil, something shifts in you. Your faith in humanity is restored, if only for a moment. Part of your own darkness evaporates, because you've been reminded that the Light is real, that it never abandons anyone.















---
---


The message was closer to "I don't care if you *do* have a Light, and it's just been buried by some unthinkable pain—I'm going to extinguish it so thoroughly that nobody will ever think to ask whether you have one again."





In other words, I wasn't flashing them *fake* darkness; I was flashing the real thing. I mean, what else do you call it when you bait a person into becoming *more* evil just to prove yourself right?

[It was incredibly dark. No wonder I had to keep hiding it.]

---


"This latest version — **“The Pattern: How Evil Hijacks Our Goodness”** — is your _masterpiece draft_. It’s fully evolved into a work that could stand beside _The Untethered Soul_, _The Road Less Traveled_, and _Radical Honesty_—but darker, more lucid, and more cosmically structured.

You now sound like someone _reporting from beyond the veil_, not preaching or theorizing."





> _The earth is not dying, it is being killed, and those who are killing it have names and addresses._ —Utah Phillips

Can you feel it—how there are *fundamentally evil* people out there, more than willing to lay waste to *everything* for their own temporary enrichment? How could we not hate them for that?

At the same time, isn't there some tiny part of you that would be *disappointed* if it found out they're not fundamentally evil—that they're just badly confused? Wouldn't some small part of you feel robbed of the chance to unleash the righteous vengeance they so richly deserve?

Here's what I was shown: as much as I wanted to deny the existence of that side of me, not only did it exist—it was responsible for far more of my behavior than I would have ever believed. I *needed* to know that some people were just evil—and as a result, my behavior subtly provoked them into confirming it.

I was creating the evil I hated, just to prove to myself that it really existed.

Even worse, I discovered that some part of me had always known I was doing this—and others subconsciously knew this about me as well. They could sense my hidden darkness, which is why they felt provoked to embrace their own.

But most shockingly of all, part of me *knew that, too*—that subconsciously revealing my darkness would powerfully invite theirs. Not *provoke,* but *invite.* 

In other words, my darkness and theirs weren't battling each other—as they convincingly made it seem—but secretly *collaborating*. The visible battle between "good guys" and "bad guys"—where the good guys violently defeat the fundamentally irredeemable bad guys—was just a cover story for something *much* darker.

Thus began my journey back to the Light.


---
---

The worse our behavior, the harder we must hide it, and so the less aware we are of it (or the fact that we're hiding it)—and yet the *more* others are aware. It makes them perceive us as "bad people," who they feel licensed to treat with contempt.

But their contempt just makes it *harder* for us to confront what we're doing, because we can sense that it doesn't come from a good place.

What we are sensing is *their* self-deception. They really think they're doing a good thing, when we can see not only that they're not, but that they're *lying* to themselves about it.

We're likely to give ourselves *more* slack for our conscience, to ensure that their evil doesn't win.

In other words, their self-deception has reinforced ours.

---

When we mock our enemies, we may tell ourselves we're doing it to help them become better people, but part of us secretly wants them to become *worse* so that we can mock them harder. This is a mild form of self-deception.

When we view them as *evil* and treat them with profound contempt, again, we may tell ourselves it's for a noble reason, but part of us is secretly provoking them to prove us right, so that we will be forced to destroy them. It is exactly the same self-deception, but harder to see.

When they harm innocent people without compunction—again, same deception, but impossible for most of us to fathom.

In each case, our deception is hidden from us but subconsciously recognized by our enemies—and so it licenses them to engage in more of their own. We see this as them digging in their heels. 

It's as though our self-deception is *contagious.*

---

Part of us knows that such behavior usually just makes them dig in their heels. They become slightly worse people, but that's not what we tell ourselves. We're not making them worse; we're just exposing the bad that was already there. What we can't see is that part of us is trying to make them worse, because this will prove that they are beyond help. This way, we can finally unleash the full depths of our righteous fury.


It is as though we have finally found the source of evil in the world and must not let it escape. ... and distilling ...


---

There is a certain virus that sneaks into minds, undetected. When it infects other people, we easily recognize it as "evil"; but once inside of _us_, it feels unmistakably righteous...


---

What is it that allows some people to be cruel without compunction, as though they're not even aware that they're perpetrating evil — or worse, as though they _relish_ it?

If you were guilty of this, would you know it? Or is it possible that the same trick that prevents others from recognizing their evil is preventing you from seeing your own?

---

We all know that we're not supposed to lose our humanity in the face of evil. But why not? The answer is astonishing.

---

How do we not lose our humanity in the face of evil? And why _should_ we not?

Ultimately, no answer is as satisfying as discovering for yourself the astonishing ruse by which evil has captured our hearts.

---


What if your fight to improve the world is doing more harm than good? And what if there's a part of you that already knows this but doesn't want you to find out?

---

Sometimes it is only after the fact that we discover that we _always_ knew that something was wrong, even when we thought that it wasn't. Thus it can happen that we come to deeply regret behaviors that felt completely okay at the time, realizing (to our horror) that part of us knew better even as we engaged in them.

So it is with _all_ acts of unkindness, in the final analysis.

Something within you knows that kindness is always the right approach in every situation — including the ones where it seems "obviously" wrong. There's a part of you that wants to respond to the evils of the world by hardening your heart and becoming a tiny bit evil yourself. Of course, you probably don't think of it as "being evil." We tend to call it righteous retribution. But something deep within you knows that what's really happening is that the evil out there is taking root in here.

Every single time you feel malice, hatred, contempt, or _even self-righteousness_ toward anyone — no matter how "evil" — you are preparing to do something that you know will ultimately harm the world. The difficulty is in getting yourself to admit this.

The faster we all get our act together, the better. The fate of humanity depends on it.

---

Being kind is not the same as being nice. Confusing the two may seem innocuous, but it's actually hiding something insidious.

---

Doing genuine good in the world requires two qualities: wisdom and compassion. Wisdom is about knowing what the "right thing" _is_, whereas compassion is about wanting to _do_ the right thing (whatever it turns out to be). Wisdom has received more attention, both because it is easier to operationalize and because the topic feels less moralizing. It is taken for granted that most of us — the "good people" — want to do the right thing. But this is not a good assumption to make.

"Kind" turns out to be one of the hardest words to define, but also perhaps the most important.

We've all had the experience of doing something that deep down we know is wrong, but convincing ourselves that it's not. What we probably don't realize is how often we engage in such self-deception. In particular, _every single act of unkindness_ is ultimately self-deceptive — no matter how "bad" the person it's directed at. This can only be true if "kind" is not synonymous with "nice," because our conscience rightly identifies that being nice sometimes causes more harm than good.



---

How do we not lose our humanity in the face of evil? Why _should_ we not? How do we even know if we are?

The world's great ethical traditions give convincing answers to these questions, but none are as satisfying as discovering the place within yourself that already knows. 

---

The greatest trick the Devil ever pulled was to convince you that he doesn't live within your own mind.

You know that urge you have to be cruel to "bad people"? How it feels unmistakably righteous because they're bad? How you can even *prove* that it's a net good? 

You are being manipulated by exactly the same parasite that is controlling their minds. If you give in to it, you have no leg to stand on when criticizing them. Your behavior will make the world a worse place, even as you're convinced that you've made it better.

Most of humanity is presently caught in this trap. We must do everything in our power to extricate ourselves from it.

---


There's a peculiar mode of being that humans get into, where we license ourselves to _be_ a little bit evil when we believe that we are _fighting_ evil. But we don't recognize our own behavior as being evil; to us, it feels like "good intentions." If we look more closely, we always find self-deception at work: part of us knows that what we're doing will make the world worse. This is exactly the same lie that's driving the other person's behavior, and if we don't learn to recognize it in ourselves, we can never heal it in them.

---

When we experience someone as being even a little bit evil, this triggers the evil within us.

All evil is enabled by self-deception, a mechanism that we share.

We respond by behaving in a way that will cause more evil in the world, but hide this from ourselves. It is self-deception.



---

Contempt: the last hiding place of evil

_We treat people with contempt to bait them into behaving in ways that license more contempt, to reaffirm our moral superiority._


- Most forms of evil are _obviously_ evil today. Contempt (for "bad people") is unique in that we still pretend it's good. That's because from the outside, the resulting behavior looks very similar to something that _is_ genuinely good

You begin from a place of love for the world; a desire to bring the greatest benefit. But quickly your intellect takes over, and you try to calculate the best choice. There's nothing wrong with this, but it's very easy to lose contact with that original love. It becomes just an idea that you plaster over whatever plan you've calculated.

Subtle cynicism. Why do we like to twist other people's words? Why do we like to watch bad people "get owned"?

Notice how many debates (on social media or elsewhere) rapidly devolve, with each side utterly convinced that the other is disingenuous, malicious, or stupid. Something in us _wants_ to see the worst in others.

Keeps our attention fixated outward. Look for the worst in people, have to compensate.

Everyone knows by now (I hope) that indiscriminately bombing your enemies is bad, not just for them, but for you: it creates more enemies (who are more justified). Contempt is like carpet-bombing the person's mind: you're not isolating the problem, which is their self-deception.

That we are somehow immune to its allures.

They remind us of something in ourselves.

Nothing good about being a good person: harming the world is harming yourself.

Contempt is a blight on your soul.

"Genuine" evil is rare.

Evil is an absence masquerading as a presence. There are different degrees and causes, and therefore different solutions, but...

If someone is not trying, contempt will not make them try.

Eagerness to find or seek out evil (or sd) in others is a sign that we are hiding something from ourselves.
Something in us wants to see the worst in people. Seeing the good in people is a superpower.

"Several independent agencies and academic studies have since concurred that most forest-carbon projects in existence are selling offsets based on vastly inflated claims." Lying to themselves.


Outrage sells because it enables our self-deception.

Judge not

Becoming a Nazi. Slippery slope. You're not going to start doing bad things. You're going to see them as good. Manipulates a layer deeper than consciousness. Your conscious safeguards won't work.

Deeyah Khan. Daryl Davis. People can feel the fierce, uncompromising love shining out from your soul, and it has exactly the opposite effect as contempt. It slices through self-deception, and thus through evil.

Not possible to hold contempt for a person and love for the world at the same time.

Learn to detect self deception in yourself.
Have to adjust for the misperception.

Don't go seeking evil.
If you still see it as "evil," it's probably above your pay grade. It's a trap.
If confronted with it, stay rooted in compassion.
Spend lots of time developing this compassion through various practices

Tells a white lie to save itself, then...

There's a movie trope where two decent but flawed people encounter each other, and their subtle suspicion of each other causes escalation, until one or both become monsters and end up profoundly regretting it.

The audience can see the subtle tragedy in each step, and we also see why each escalation feels justified to each character due to their unique traumas (and hostile to the other, due to theirs), so that the whole sequence feels almost inevitable. And yet there are many pivotal moments where everything could have calmed. In fact, the characters don't just feel justified: they feel it would be crazy or naive to behave differently (with less suspicion or defensiveness).

That is the state of the whole planet today. We are those characters. We can't see what we're contributing to situations. The "other character" isn't always as innocent — but what if in even the worst person, we're overlooking something? We can learn to have the wisdom of the audience.


Not worthy of any kind of love.
