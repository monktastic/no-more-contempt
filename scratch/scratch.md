Contempt: the last hiding place of evil

- Most forms of evil are _obviously_ evil today. Contempt (for "bad people") is unique in that we still pretend it's good. That's because from the outside, the resulting behavior looks very similar to something that _is_ genuinely good

When we perceive someone as fundamentally morally defective, we take pleasure in seeing them hurt (even if only emotionally). We may tell ourselves that the pleasure isn't actually for the pain itself, but for the good that it will do (e.g., forcing them to reflect or deterring others). But this is a lie: part of us secretly delights in the suffering itself, justifying that it's okay because they're bad.

But they can see that we crave their suffering, and so they perceive _us_ as evil — for _precisely the same reason we saw them that way_. This provokes them further. Even if they decide not to behave that way again (in public) — which we chalk up as a "win" — their world has gotten darker, which licenses more self-deception. In other words, they become a little more evil.

But the _really_ crazy part is that we _want_ them to become more evil, because this vindicates our perception of them as fundamentally broken: after all, wouldn't any sane person have simply repented? Not only does this prove that our nastiness was righteous, it licenses us to escalate it — and watching a *really* bad person suffer is all the more delicious. 

As long as there is a _trace_ of malice in our minds, their mind will seize on it as an excuse to not have to confront their conscience — and part of us _knows_ and _wants_ this. It is the secret goal of our malice.
