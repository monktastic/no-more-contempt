Contempt: the last hiding place of evil

_We treat people with contempt to bait them into behaving in ways that license more contempt, to reaffirm our moral superiority._


- Most forms of evil are _obviously_ evil today. Contempt (for "bad people") is unique in that we still pretend it's good. That's because from the outside, the resulting behavior looks very similar to something that _is_ genuinely good

You begin from a place of love for the world; a desire to bring the greatest benefit. But quickly your intellect takes over, and you try to calculate the best choice. There's nothing wrong with this, but it's very easy to lose contact with that original love. It becomes just an idea that you plaster over whatever plan you've calculated.

Subtle cynicism. Why do we like to twist other people's words? Why do we like to watch bad people "get owned"?

Notice how many debates (on social media or elsewhere) rapidly devolve, with each side utterly convinced that the other is disingenuous, malicious, or stupid. Something in us _wants_ to see the worst in others.

Keeps our attention fixated outward. Look for the worst in people, have to compensate.

Everyone knows by now (I hope) that indiscriminately bombing your enemies is bad, not just for them, but for you: it creates more enemies (who are more justified). Contempt is like carpet-bombing the person's mind: you're not isolating the problem, which is their self-deception.

That we are somehow immune to its allures.

They remind us of something in ourselves.

Nothing good about being a good person: harming the world is harming yourself.

Contempt is a blight on your soul.

"Genuine" evil is rare.

Evil is an absence masquerading as a presence. There are different degrees and causes, and therefore different solutions, but...

If someone is not trying, contempt will not make them try.

Eagerness to find or seek out evil (or sd) in others is a sign that we are hiding something from ourselves.
Something in us wants to see the worst in people. Seeing the good in people is a superpower.

"Several independent agencies and academic studies have since concurred that most forest-carbon projects in existence are selling offsets based on vastly inflated claims." Lying to themselves.


Outrage sells because it enables our self-deception.

Judge not

Becoming a Nazi. Slippery slope. You're not going to start doing bad things. You're going to see them as good. Manipulates a layer deeper than consciousness. Your conscious safeguards won't work.

Deeyah Khan. Daryl Davis. People can feel the fierce, uncompromising love shining out from your soul, and it has exactly the opposite effect as contempt. It slices through self-deception, and thus through evil.

Not possible to hold contempt for a person and love for the world at the same time.

Learn to detect self deception in yourself.
Have to adjust for the misperception.

Don't go seeking evil.
If you still see it as "evil," it's probably above your pay grade. It's a trap.
If confronted with it, stay rooted in compassion.
Spend lots of time developing this compassion through various practices

Tells a white lie to save itself, then...

There's a movie trope where two decent but flawed people encounter each other, and their subtle suspicion of each other causes escalation, until one or both become monsters and end up profoundly regretting it.

The audience can see the subtle tragedy in each step, and we also see why each escalation feels justified to each character due to their unique traumas (and hostile to the other, due to theirs), so that the whole sequence feels almost inevitable. And yet there are many pivotal moments where everything could have calmed. In fact, the characters don't just feel justified: they feel it would be crazy or naive to behave differently (with less suspicion or defensiveness).

That is the state of the whole planet today. We are those characters. We can't see what we're contributing to situations. The "other character" isn't always as innocent — but what if in even the worst person, we're overlooking something? We can learn to have the wisdom of the audience.


Not worthy of any kind of love.
