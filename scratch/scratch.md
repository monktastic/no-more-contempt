There is something uniquely delicious about visiting righteous vengeance upon evil people. So our subconscious mind does something very clever: it searches for people who we can plausibly describe as "evil," and then it makes us bait them into behaving in ways that validate our perception of them. But it's _how_ we bait them that's the really interesting part.

Baiting people into evil is, well... evil. So we hide our true intentions, telling ourselves that we are "fighting evil." This is self-deception. As it turns out, self-deception is precisely the mechanism behind _all_ forms of evil: people know perfectly well when what they are doing is wrong, but the _wrongness_ is carefully hidden from conscious self-reflection.

So part of them can sense that we're profound hypocrites, and that we don't have the moral authority to be judging them (at least, in that moment). They therefore see _us_ as evil, and feel compelled to fight back. Mission accomplished: we can now be confident that they are evil.

Did you notice the actual bait? It wasn't our behavior — whether we yelled at, mocked, or even shot them. Those can all be perfectly valid ways to fight evil, given the right circumstances. The bait was the _intention with which we did it._ Simply by harboring malice or self-righteousness, you are telegraphing to the world your "secret" intent to create more evil — and that is all that is required to make it work. Brilliant, isn't it?

And it gets better.

This behavior is caused by a kind of parasite that lives in our minds. It manipulates our very perception so that we literally _see_ some people as deserving of malice. For you, it is the "bad people" — those who are fundamentally morally defective. But the thing is, they're not _fundamentally_ defective; they're actually under the sway of the very same parasite.

Your parasite is tricking you into overlooking the parasite in others, so that you behave in ways that give _their_ parasite the ammo it needs to trick them into doing the same right back at us. Don't you see? Your parasite and theirs aren't enemies — they are _allies!_ **All** of our parasites are allied, getting us to behave in ways that strengthen each other's at every turn.

This is that secret "evil global conspiracy" that everyone fears exists — and part of it lives within your very own mind. While under its terrible sway, every single thing you do to "fight" evil out there only amplifies it.

Its greatest trick is to convince you that it does not live in your mind, but only "out there." Maybe you think that okay, fine, you have a _tiny_ role to play in the world's ills, but still, the evil people are the real problem. But the truth is, once you are totally free of your parasite, that illusion falls apart — because you now directly perceive their parasites.

Have you noticed that hating people is obviously wrong, but hating "bad people" feels more than okay? Why is that?

There is a certain virus that sneaks into minds, undetected. When it infects other people, we easily recognize it as "evil"; but once inside of _us_, it feels unmistakably righteous...

---

What is the best way to fight evil? The obvious answer is to find the "evil people" and fight them, but there is a very good reason that this plan hasn't been working.

Evil behaves like a parasite that infects people's minds and alters their very perception. It makes them see certain other people as subhuman, and thus fair game for cruelty. The infectee — the "evil person" — knows perfectly well that this is wrong at _some_ level, but the parasite cleverly shields that "wrongness" from conscious self-reflection. The person simultaneously _knows_ and _doesn't_.

We are all familiar with this schism of mind. We've all had the experience of skirting our conscience, either by pretending that we couldn't hear it, or that we could get away with overriding it. It is a kind of self-deception, and it is precisely this mechanism that enables _all_ evil.

When the parasite infects someone who considers themselves a "good person" — like you or me — it does something especially clever: the "certain other people" who it makes look subhuman are the "bad people." Think about it: doesn't it feel positively _righteous_ to treat those people with cruelty? It may be hard to admit this to yourself, but part of you knows that this is a dangerous lie.

When we viciously attack a "bad person," part of them can sense that we are under the sway of exactly the same parasite that they are. Therefore, we have no moral authority by which to judge them. So, far from simply repenting, they now see _us_ as evil, and include us in their group of "people who deserve cruelty." We take this as confirmation that they, likewise, belong in _ours._

This plan _can't_ work to end evil, because it was designed by the parasite _not_ to work. On the contrary, it is specifically designed to _strengthen_ the grip of the parasite in all of our minds — and it is working astonishingly well. Somehow, after thousands of years, we haven't caught on to its trick.

So is the solution to _not_ fight "evil people"? Not exactly. The trick is to see that there _are_ no "evil people"; only people who are more and less infected by the parasite. Once you see this — really _see_, and not just _believe_ — you no longer feel like you are fighting _people_. You are only ever fighting the parasite that has infected _all_ of our minds.

Sometimes, fighting the parasite certainly takes the _form_ of fighting people. So then what's the difference? You never feel _malice_, the sinister pleasure of watching people be harmed. You're not gleefully shoving the "bad people" further into the dark, like you were when under the sway of your parasite. You feel no _self-righteousness_; the sense that you are fundamentally better than anyone else. You can now see clearly that you are not; that this idea has **always** been the parasite talking.

This is called _compassion,_ and other people can sense it. There is no particular form that it must take. It can be fierce or even violent if necessary. But your fundamental benevolence prevents their parasites from using your evil as justification to further infect their minds. This makes **all** the difference in the world. It is the only way to actually fight evil instead of unwittingly spreading it.

That is why the fight against evil _must_ begin with doing everything in your power to find and evict the parasite that has secretly commandeered your mind.

What is it that allows some people to be cruel without compunction, as though they're not even aware that they're perpetrating evil — or worse, as though they _relish_ it?

If you were guilty of this, would you know it? Or is it possible that the same trick that prevents others from recognizing their evil is preventing you from seeing your own?

---

We all know that we're not supposed to lose our humanity in the face of evil. But why not? The answer is astonishing.

---

How do we not lose our humanity in the face of evil? And why _should_ we not?

Ultimately, no answer is as satisfying as discovering for yourself the astonishing ruse by which evil has captured our hearts.

What is it that allows some people to be cruel without compunction, as though they're not even aware that they're perpetrating evil — or worse, as though they relish it?

---

What if your fight to improve the world is doing more harm than good? And what if there's a part of you that already knows this but doesn't want you to find out?

---

Sometimes it is only after the fact that we discover that we _always_ knew that something was wrong, even when we thought that it wasn't. Thus it can happen that we come to deeply regret behaviors that felt completely okay at the time, realizing (to our horror) that part of us knew better even as we engaged in them.

So it is with _all_ acts of unkindness, in the final analysis.

Something within you knows that kindness is always the right approach in every situation — including the ones where it seems "obviously" wrong. There's a part of you that wants to respond to the evils of the world by hardening your heart and becoming a tiny bit evil yourself. Of course, you probably don't think of it as "being evil." We tend to call it righteous retribution. But something deep within you knows that what's really happening is that the evil out there is taking root in here.

Every single time you feel malice, hatred, contempt, or _even self-righteousness_ toward anyone — no matter how "evil" — you are preparing to do something that you know will ultimately harm the world. The difficulty is in getting yourself to admit this.

The faster we all get our act together, the better. The fate of humanity depends on it.

---

Being kind is not the same as being nice. Confusing the two may seem innocuous, but it's actually hiding something insidious.

---

Doing genuine good in the world requires two qualities: wisdom and compassion. Wisdom is about knowing what the "right thing" _is_, whereas compassion is about wanting to _do_ the right thing (whatever it turns out to be). Wisdom has received more attention, both because it is easier to operationalize and because the topic feels less moralizing. It is taken for granted that most of us — the "good people" — want to do the right thing. But this is not a good assumption to make.

"Kind" turns out to be one of the hardest words to define, but also perhaps the most important.

We've all had the experience of doing something that deep down we know is wrong, but convincing ourselves that it's not. What we probably don't realize is how often we engage in such self-deception. In particular, _every single act of unkindness_ is ultimately self-deceptive — no matter how "bad" the person it's directed at. This can only be true if "kind" is not synonymous with "nice," because our conscience rightly identifies that being nice sometimes causes more harm than good.



---

How do we not lose our humanity in the face of evil? Why _should_ we not? How do we even know if we are?

The world's great ethical traditions give convincing answers to these questions, but none are as satisfying as discovering the place within yourself that already knows. 

---

The greatest trick the Devil ever pulled was to convince you that he doesn't live within your own mind.

You know that urge you have to be cruel to "bad people"? How it feels unmistakably righteous because they're bad? How you can even *prove* that it's a net good? 

You are being manipulated by exactly the same parasite that is controlling their minds. If you give in to it, you have no leg to stand on when criticizing them. Your behavior will make the world a worse place, even as you're convinced that you've made it better.

Most of humanity is presently caught in this trap. We must do everything in our power to extricate ourselves from it.

There's a peculiar mode of being that humans get into, where we license ourselves to _be_ a little bit evil when we believe that we are _fighting_ evil. But we don't recognize our own behavior as being evil; to us, it feels like "good intentions." If we look more closely, we always find self-deception at work: part of us knows that what we're doing will make the world worse. This is exactly the same lie that's driving the other person's behavior, and if we don't learn to recognize it in ourselves, we can never heal it in them.

---

When we experience someone as being even a little bit evil, this triggers the evil within us.

All evil is enabled by self-deception, a mechanism that we share.

We respond by behaving in a way that will cause more evil in the world, but hide this from ourselves. It is self-deception.

Contempt: the last hiding place of evil

_We treat people with contempt to bait them into behaving in ways that license more contempt, to reaffirm our moral superiority._


- Most forms of evil are _obviously_ evil today. Contempt (for "bad people") is unique in that we still pretend it's good. That's because from the outside, the resulting behavior looks very similar to something that _is_ genuinely good

---

You begin from a place of love for the world; a desire to bring the greatest benefit. But quickly your intellect takes over, and you try to calculate the best choice. There's nothing wrong with this, but it's very easy to lose contact with that original love. It becomes just an idea that you plaster over whatever plan you've calculated.

---


Subtle cynicism. Why do we like to twist other people's words? Why do we like to watch bad people "get owned"?

Notice how many debates (on social media or elsewhere) rapidly devolve, with each side utterly convinced that the other is disingenuous, malicious, or stupid. Something in us _wants_ to see the worst in others.

Keeps our attention fixated outward. Look for the worst in people, have to compensate.

Everyone knows by now (I hope) that indiscriminately bombing your enemies is bad, not just for them, but for you: it creates more enemies (who are more justified). Contempt is like carpet-bombing the person's mind: you're not isolating the problem, which is their self-deception.

---

That we are somehow immune to its allures.

They remind us of something in ourselves.

Nothing good about being a good person: harming the world is harming yourself.

Contempt is a blight on your soul.

"Genuine" evil is rare.

Evil is an absence masquerading as a presence. There are different degrees and causes, and therefore different solutions, but...

If someone is not trying, contempt will not make them try.

Eagerness to find or seek out evil (or sd) in others is a sign that we are hiding something from ourselves.
Something in us wants to see the worst in people. Seeing the good in people is a superpower.

"Several independent agencies and academic studies have since concurred that most forest-carbon projects in existence are selling offsets based on vastly inflated claims." Lying to themselves.


Outrage sells because it enables our self-deception.

Judge not

Becoming a Nazi. Slippery slope. You're not going to start doing bad things. You're going to see them as good. Manipulates a layer deeper than consciousness. Your conscious safeguards won't work.

Deeyah Khan. Daryl Davis. People can feel the fierce, uncompromising love shining out from your soul, and it has exactly the opposite effect as contempt. It slices through self-deception, and thus through evil.

Not possible to hold contempt for a person and love for the world at the same time.

Learn to detect self deception in yourself.
Have to adjust for the misperception.

Don't go seeking evil.
If you still see it as "evil," it's probably above your pay grade. It's a trap.
If confronted with it, stay rooted in compassion.
Spend lots of time developing this compassion through various practices

Tells a white lie to save itself, then...

There's a movie trope where two decent but flawed people encounter each other, and their subtle suspicion of each other causes escalation, until one or both become monsters and end up profoundly regretting it.

The audience can see the subtle tragedy in each step, and we also see why each escalation feels justified to each character due to their unique traumas (and hostile to the other, due to theirs), so that the whole sequence feels almost inevitable. And yet there are many pivotal moments where everything could have calmed. In fact, the characters don't just feel justified: they feel it would be crazy or naive to behave differently (with less suspicion or defensiveness).

That is the state of the whole planet today. We are those characters. We can't see what we're contributing to situations. The "other character" isn't always as innocent — but what if in even the worst person, we're overlooking something? We can learn to have the wisdom of the audience.


Not worthy of any kind of love.
