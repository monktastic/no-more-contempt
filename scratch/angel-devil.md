Imagine giving someone a dehumanizing stare. It's hard to do, isn't it? It feels evil — because it is. Now imagine that this someone is a "bad person." The worse you perceive them as being, the more righteous it will feel. Yet it will never look any less evil to them — _because it's not._ And unless they are a saint (which they're not), this will only make them feel _more_ justified in whatever storyline is fueling their misbehavior — because they are opposing _evil_. Meanwhile, you will take this as confirmation that _they_ really are evil and intensify your contemptuous gaze. 

This will result in an all-too-familiar downward spiral. And it isn't an unhappy accident: it was actually orchestrated by a dark aspect within _both_ of your minds. Yours baited theirs, and vice versa — and it could all be communicated subconsciously, through the eyes and tone of voice.

You know the classic image of the angel and devil on our shoulders? It's almost accurate, except for two things. First, the angel isn't really external to you, but represents your deepest nature; your profound love for the world. The devil _is_ external; it is a kind of parasite. But it doesn't just whisper obviously-bad ideas into your ear: it alters your very perception and convinces you that it's your angel.

Its job is to make other people appear subhuman, so that harming them feels okay. Your morals (and social norms) act as a kind of buffer, so that it can't do this openly with most people. But it's always on the hunt for victims, and it only needs the slightest provocation to begin its manipulation.

It searches for people whose misbehavior can't be chalked up to a "great battle." Your angel knows that if you look deeply enough, you will _always_ find their source of pain — and that even though it won't condone their sins, it will prevent you from hating them. So your devil does something insanely clever: it makes you perceive their devil as _intrinsic_ to their minds. In other words, it makes you see them as _fundamentally defective_ — and therefore subhuman.

This is the wedge it uses to prevent your angel from getting a solid grip. And the nature of _their_ devil is such that you will both rapidly accelerate away from any possibility of mutual humanizing.
