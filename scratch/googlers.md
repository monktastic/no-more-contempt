C: Have you ever noticed how much you enjoy mocking and shaming your enemies?

M: I wouldn't exactly say "enjoy." It's more of a necessary evil.

C: Huh, interesting turn of phrase. Anyway, have you noticed how they usually just dig in their heels?

M: Of course. 

C: And why do you think that is?

M: Because they're *bad,* of course. What else can you expect from a bad person?

C: Uh huh. Do you think that maybe part of you *wants* them to do that?

M: *Wants* my enemies to dig in their heels? That's ridiculous.

C: It is, isn't it? But be honest: how does it *feel* when you punish them? Isn't it a little bit... pleasurable?

M: Well sure, but so what?

C: Do you think that maybe part of you secretly wants *more* of that feeling?

M: Oh I see where you're going with this. You think I'm *making* them double down so that I can enjoy the delicious feeling of punishing them harder. That's a reach. And anyway, how would I even do such a thing? I'm not in control of their minds.

C: But if you made them see *you* as evil...

M: ... they would feel compelled to fight back, sure. But I'm *not* evil. The very fact that they even think this *proves* that they're hopelessly delusional.

C: Okay. But what if they can *see* that you're secretly trying to make them double down, and then on top of that, denying it? Wouldn't *that* make them see you as evil?

M: Oh, come on. There's no way they can see it. I didn't even notice it until you told me!

C: Which means there might be more you're not noticing. Really look here. What were you really conveying through your tone and gaze?

M: I mean, I was subtly warning them not to cross me, if that's what you mean.

C: Mm-hmm. And maybe hinting at how much you would enjoy it if they tried?

M: Fine! But it was still their choice to *actually do it!*

C: Okay, so we've established that something in you was secretly trying to provoke their darkness, without you being fully conscious of it, right?

M: I guess.

C: Do you think that maybe something similar was happening in them?

M: I'm not getting it. Say more.

C: Well, whatever you were judging them for — do you think they *knew* it was wrong?

M: I mean, they should have.

C: Is it possible that this knowledge was being hidden from their conscious mind, much in the same way it was in you?

M: Oh, I see. Sure, there's a common mechanism that helps us hide things from ourselves.

C: And do you think that your behavior *strengthened* or *weakened* that mechanism in them?

M: Hmm. Strengthened, I guess. They probably felt *less* guilty for their misbehavior.

C: Because?

M: Because they saw that their enemy isn't so innocent after all?

C: Now you're getting it! The self-deception in you *reinforced* the same capacity in them, by demonstrating itself to them.

M: But I didn't know this was happening!

C: Well, *part* of you didn't know. But a deeper part knew *perfectly well* — and it was the juxtaposition of these two that allowed the whole thing to unfold as it did. In fact, *all* evil depends on precisely this schismed mental state.

M: So even Hitler...

C: Yes! He *thought* he was doing the right thing, but he *knew* he was doing the wrong thing.

M: But how could you possibly know that?

C: You'll see it for yourself in due time. For now, ask yourself: why did the Nazis have to describe the Jews as "*Ungeziefer*" (vermin)?

M: Because they couldn't do what they did if they saw their victims as human?

C: Precisely. What does that tell you about them?

M: That there must have been humanity still buried in them somewhere.

C: Indeed. The *only* way to cause harm to another being is by blocking your perception of the *life* in them.

Consider the "bad people" of the world — the murderers, rapists, child abusers; the greedy bankers, hypocritical CEOs, corrupt politicians, etc. How are they able to do what they do without compunction?

It's not that they don't know that they're doing wrong. Part of them knows *perfectly well*, of course — but this knowledge is carefully shielded from conscious self-reflection, so that in another sense, they really don't know. It is a profound form of self-deception.

To give you a taste of what it's like, ask yourself if you've ever felt the urge to violently punish the "bad guys." This can be difficult to admit. In that state, your mind is convinced that you're acting righteously, but a deeper part of you knows that satisfying this dark urge will make the world an overall darker place. You may not know *how*, exactly — and yet you somehow know.

It is extremely easy to override this knowledge by engaging in clever rationalization. It works all the better if you don't know that you're doing this. The more you rationalize, the more you lose contact with the part of you that *knows,* in favor of the part that *thinks* it does — until eventually the former gets seemingly absorbed into the latter. In other words, you become convinced that you can *calculate* right from wrong.

It is impossible to communicate how insidious it is to slide down this path. It never *feels* like evil — though that is where it inevitably leads. On the contrary, it feels impossibly righteous; like I am one of the noble few valiantly *fighting* evil. Ironically, this is the surest sign that we are already trapped.


In its milder forms, it just feels like normal listlessness or ennui, in which the world is 



telling right from wrong feels like something you can *calculate.* It is *not* — but by this point, it has become impossible to convince you of this.

Hitler famously believed he was doing good. How could you ever be sure that something similar isn't happening to you — that what you're certain is *good* is actually far from it?

No amount of thinking could ever help, because the whole cognitive system is compromised in that state. And you certainly can't rely on the *feeling* of doing good, for the same reason. So what's left?

The truth is that *something* in Hitler's mind knew perfectly well that he'd gone off the rails. But what is that "something," and why couldn't he hear it? And how do I know that he had it in the first place?

There is a kind of cognitive bug that infects every one of us. It has the perverse feature that the more thoroughly it colonizes our minds, the less able we are to recognize it. It is why the most awful people also tend to be the loudest in condemning others.

Even in those of us who are aware of this trap and try to correct for it, it has exceptionally clever mechanisms to ensure that we never fully disengage its core functionality. Like a series of false awakenings, its layers of deception convince us that we're free of it even as it penetrates deeper.

Unfortunately, the same thing that prevents us from recognizing its presence in us also precludes us from communicating the full extent of its nature and influence. This is why it has traditionally been mythologized. The Christians know it as the Devil, and the Buddhists call it the ego. It's not merely that they lacked the sophistication to make it more precise; it's that its very form resists conceptual containment. Yet it *can* be made satisfyingly precise — but only by engaging a deeper aspect of mind. We only hope to elicit a flicker of that here.

Reflect on how many supposedly well-intentioned projects have unintended consequences. For example, the War on Terror created a new generation of enemies vowing revenge. Was it a net good or net harm? Mocking and shaming our political opponents tends to make them dig in their heels, but is this outweighed by the benefits (such as dissuading undecided parties)?

These may seem like merely optimization problems — albeit ones that are very complicated to evaluate. Yet see if a part of you knows that mocking your enemies is not only *liable* to make them double down, but is secretly *intended* to. It is this same part of you that makes you *believe* that you're solving an optimization problem when you're actually justifying a dark impulse.

What is this "dark impulse?" Pause and consider how gratifying it is to violently punish evil. Could something in you be setting up conditions that enable — or better yet, *force* — you to escalate toward this goal? A simple way to accomplish this would be to somehow *force* your enemy to dig in their heels. But how would you do this?

An obvious way would be to make them perceive *you* as evil. But *you* know that you're not evil, so how could you make them see you this way? If you did it in a way that was too self-aware, this very self-awareness would dull the effect: they would realize they're being manipulated. It works much better when *even you* don't realize what you're doing. The self-deception required for such an act is *itself* the strongest signal that you are up to no good.

Moreover, something in us has to know that our enemy will recognize this. We somehow know that people in general recognize self-deception as a sign of "darkness" operating. How do we know this? Because it's a universal human trait: the only way people can do wrong is by secretly hiding this knowledge from themselves. We somehow know this is true of our enemy.

Why would they have to hide it from themselves? What are they hiding it *from,* exactly? *From the part of their mind that would immediately put an end to it if only it knew.* Something in us *knows* that this part exists in them — which also means that we know that we're pushing them further away from this part by inducing them to dig in their heels.

To put it poetically, something in us is *knowingly distancing others from their inner Light.* We are only capable of doing this when we are distanced from our own. But notice how it doesn't feel like that. It feels impossibly righteous. Moreover, there is no objective evidence that any such thing is happening. There certainly are examples where mocking or shaming have had positive long-term outcomes. This is crucial: the "good" and "bad" versions of these behaviors can be made to appear arbitrarily similar even while producing vastly different outcomes.

Also notice how it was our own willingness to engage in dark behavior that elicited the same response in our enemy. This illustrates another important point: the bug is *infectious*. But the vector of infection is not always so obvious. The bug is *impossibly clever* at transmitting itself through Rube Goldberg-eqsque chains of events while still retaining its original potency. It is how seemingly-noble agendas often cause harm: the harm was seeded into the initial intention.

This is much harder to communicate, but there are conditions under which it can be seen clearly. While it is impossible to describe the experience of that state, we can try to capture something of its essence. Please forgive the mystical-sounding description. I see no way around it.

What you perceive as an external reality is a kind of creation of your mind. In actuality, you and the world are a unified whole, and the deepest part of you can always perceive this. Yet there is a resistance to consciously recognizing it. That resistance causes you to behave in ways that reshape your "external world" so that the illusion of separation becomes more self-evidently true — for example, by reinforcing the illusion that the "bad people" are fundamentally different from you. This has *actual, verifiable results* in your "outer reality."

Conversely, any action taken from a conscious recognition our unity tends to *undo* the illusion of separation. For example, by treating your enemies with a kind of fierce compassion — for example, stopping their misbehavior without contemptuously judging them for it — will tend to "heal" the apparent split.

Humans have a nearly unlimited capacity for self-deception. We engage in self-serving behaviors by convincing ourselves that they're no such thing.



---

The same mistake is happening in nearly all of us, all the time, albeit to a much lesser degree. It is the reason that so many well-intentioned projects result in "unintended consequences." There is an aspect of the mind that can actually foresee those consequences — not in their specifics, exactly, but in their broad strokes.



But it is the very same principle, and it is *contagious*: any time any one of us engages in it, we reinforce it in everyone else.

Therefore, the best thing you can do for the world is to free yourself from this mechanism. It is only by doing so that you begin to appreciate just how much of our "good intentions" are badly misguided, and how to reorient not only yourself but also the rest of us.

Consider how good it feels to mock, shame, and contemptuously judge our enemies. We tell ourselves that this will somehow benefit the world, but the truth is that something in us secretly *wants* them to defy us, so that we will be forced to unleash the full extent of our righteous wrath. *Nothing* feels better than violently punishing evil.

This is incredibly difficult to admit. Not only because we are increasing the "net animosity" in the world — which would be bad enough — but because of how we accomplish it. The deepest part of you can actually perceive your commonality with your enemies — that they are only able to cause harm due to a kind of confusion that you yourself share — but it seizes on this opportunity to shove them deeper *into* the abyss in a way that it can disguise as righteous.

This is *malevolent.* If you look carefully enough, you will discover that it has the same signature as *all the evil there ever was*. This is why your enemy defies you: because you are flashing them *genuine darkness.* But it never feels like that, does it? It is only by discovering the fiendish cleverness of this trick — by which the darkness manipulates you into doing its bidding while convincing you that you're not — that you begin to appreciate exactly how the "bad people" are confused.

It is not possible to think or calculate your way to goodness. For the same reason, it is impossible for me to convince you of this. It may be possible, however, to give you hints toward remembering it — because something in you already knows.

The deepest part of you wants nothing more than to be of service to the world. The same is true of literally everybody else — but it doesn't feel like that, does it? Some people seem to be *fundamentally morally defective* — or *evil*, for short. Bring to mind whomever you believe those people to be
