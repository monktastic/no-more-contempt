Reflecting on the dysfunctional state of the world, it's hard not to suspect that there's some sort of evil conspiracy lurking behind it all. In a sense, there actually is, but it is *infinitely more strange* than we can fathom. The only way to end it is to recognize its existence within our very own minds. Only by freeing ourselves from its insidious grip do we gain the capacity to free others.

Have you ever done something that you believed was right at the time, only to realize much later that it was actually wrong — even according to your own deepest standards? It is a bizarre sort of experience. You are confronted with the fact that on some level, you knew it was wrong even as you did it — yet you managed to hide this knowledge from yourself, so that in another sense, you really *didn't* know. Every one of us engages in such "conscience skirting," whether we realize it or not. Indeed, it is those of us who are least aware of it who are most engaged in it.

What is it that allows us to hide knowledge of our wrongdoing from our own conscious minds? This state is a paradoxical one: we simultaneously *know* and yet somehow *do not.* It is this phenomenon that is responsible for *all the evil there ever was,* from the tiniest act of unkindness to the most horrific atrocity ever committed. Our examples may differ in degree, but not in kind — and every time any one of us engages in it, we lower the threshold for others to do the same.

We never notice when we ourselves are in it, but we're highly sensitive to its presence in others. It makes us perceive them as *bad people*, who we then feel compelled to treat accordingly. We believe that by treating the "bad people" with contempt — that is, as though they are *fundamentally defective* — we will somehow benefit the world. But if you look carefully enough into your mind while feeling this way — and this is hard — you'll discover something much more insidious at work.

Contempt is a fundamentally malicious attitude, and simply by harboring it, you are telegraphing to your target that you're in the grip of self-deception yourself. You may feel like you're "fighting evil," but deep down, you know that you're only liable to make them dig in their heels — which you can then use as evidence that you were right about them, thus compelling you to escalate. Something in us *wants* to be forced to unleash the full extent of our righteous wrath — perhaps the most delicious feeling of all.

Although you may not realize that you're doing this — at least, consciously — your enemy subconsciously does, which is *why* they dig in their heels. They are perceiving in you the very error that you are viciously judging them for, which makes them perceive *you* as "evil" for precisely the same reason you see *them* that way. Any compunction they might have felt about their own wrongdoing goes out the window — which is precisely the result you secretly wanted.

What happened is that the darkness in your own mind recognized itself in your enemy, who it then lured into this trap. It is like a *secret handshake* between your darkness and theirs. The world is darkened as a result, but we don't notice this — or if we do, we blame it on them. After all, any *decent* person would have repented, or at least introspected, in the face of such overwhelming good. We have created *new evil* in the world, but we tell ourselves that we're simply uncovering the evil already there. After all, they are *fundamentally* defective, and so nothing *we* did could have made any difference.

This is just one of an infinite number of ways the darkness tricks us into doing its bidding while flawlessly convinced that we are helping. The truth is that *any* time we skirt our conscience — which is *far more often* than we realize — we are secretly inviting others to do the same, who we can then blame for the sorry state of the world, thereby licensing ourselves to engage in *more* self-serving behavior that we will never recognize as such.

This is how the darkness keeps itself alive; cleverly hiding itself from our own minds while powerfully sensitizing us to its presence in others. We don't recognize that they are in the grip of a delusion that we ourselves are highly susceptible to; no, we see *their* evil as intrinsic, compelling us to viciously attack it. We never realize that this feeling of *moral superiority* is itself the surest sign that we are under its dark sway. A mind that is free of self-deception simply cannot feel malice, contempt, or even self-righteousness toward *anybody* for any reason.

This is the opposite of what society teaches us: that to be "good people," we must show our contempt for the "bad people." In a way, this isn't entirely wrong: contempt for *beliefs* and *behaviors* can indeed come from a good place. But it almost always degenerates into contempt for the people themselves. All goodwill drains from our hearts, and we embrace the darkness, convincing ourselves that in this case, it isn't really darkness at all. In fact, we can *prove* it.

This could all be avoided if we learned to listen to our hearts instead of focusing exclusively on our minds. Our thoughts can be freely manipulated by the darkness, which is why it is so easy to justify evil behavior. Our thoughts are the perfect vector for the darkness to sneak in, without us ever suspecting it. If you *really* want to know whether you're acting from your inner Light or from your darkness, you cannot blindly trust your mind. You must learn to see deeper.

The vast majority of dark behavior feels nothing at all like evil. It simply feels like "business as usual." We find all kinds of ways to justify subtly self-serving behavior, covering it up with clever cover stories about all the good it will do. These justifications have a certain "signature" to them that you can learn to perceive, both in yourself and in others. When you recognize it, stay far away. You can be *certain* that no good will come of it, no matter how cleverly anyone proves otherwise. Disregard this at your own peril — and at everyone else's, too.

The darkness dims our perception of the *life* in others — be they people, animals, or nature at large — so that we cannot feel the deep sense of wrongness that comes from dominating, exploiting, or mistreating them. It's not that we *can't* feel it; it's that the darkness *blinds* us to it. It is this phenomenon that enables genocides, our ravaging of the planet — and, perhaps most surprisingly, our hatred for the people who engage in these atrocities.

It is impossible to overstate just how insidious the darkness is. It behaves like a _singular distributed malevolent entity_, manipulating all of humanity from beneath our conscious thresholds. The Christians know it as the Devil, and the Buddhists call it the ego. You can treat it as a metaphor, but it is as real as anything you can touch. It is the _primordial_ evil conspiracy; the one to which all the rest owe their existence, and to which they ultimately filter up. 

We are learning to recognize that "the elites" are playing us against each other, to take our attention off of them — but the Darkness is playing a _much bigger game_; one in which even the elites are merely pawns. It _needs_ us to hate them, to keep the whole cycle alive. By keeping our attention fixated perpetually outward, on the evil "out there," we never notice its insidious presence "in here"; the one place where we can actually defeat it.

It is only once you've seen how thoroughly the Darkness has ensnared your own mind that you begin to appreciate what is taking place in the minds of the "bad people" — and exactly how to free them of it. Without seeing this, it is *only* possible to drive them deeper into its sinister clutches, while feeling flawlessly convinced that you are "helping." So how do we see it?

This is a sensitive point: on one hand, you genuinely don't know that you're doing this; but on the other, you absolutely do. If someone were to contemptuously judge you for the part of you that *knows*, it would only trigger that very same defense mechanism, thereby darkening the world. At the same time, if you are allowed to stay in the dark about this knowledge, 


---

What exactly is this phenomenon that allows us to hide knowledge of our wrongdoing from our own conscious minds? It is precisely the *same* mechanism that compels us to hate other people for engaging in it.


---
---

Imagine if someone were to excoriate you while you're in this state — that is, to viciously judge you for your obvious self-deception. Would you take it well? Of course not. No matter how right they were, part of you would recognize that they were lost in the very same trap. Who are they to judge? They don't have your best interests at heart — or really *anyone's*, despite what they may say. It's a purely egoic play, meant to make them look good while throwing you under the bus. This makes you *less* likely to own up to your misbehavior in the future — *even to yourself*.

In other words, your capacity for self-deception triggers theirs, which reinforces yours.

Do *they* know that they are doing this? Yes and no. Consciously, they really believe that they're doing the right thing. But deep down, something in them knows that their behavior will create a darker world. Although they cannot see this malintent, you certainly can — and it makes you perceive *them* as evil for precisely the same reason they see *you* that way. You now feel emboldened to be cruel to people like them in the future — because cruelty isn't actually wrong when it's directed at the "bad people." In fact, it's practically your *duty* as a "good person."

What actually happened is that the darkness in your mind — the thing that allows you to hide knowledge from yourself — acted as a lightning rod for theirs, inviting them to behave in a way that would cause both of you to increase the "net darkness" in the world. Yet you both walk away feeling like you did your best; that you were only "fighting evil."

This is how the darkness spreads without anyone recognizing their own complicity. Each of us feels like the righteous saviors of the world, not realizing that by simply harboring this complex, we are secretly inviting others to puncture our sense of moral superiority, so that they can see themselves in the same way. The key word is *inviting.* We carry this self-perception specifically *so that* we can provoke the "bad people" into behaviors that we can then judge them for.

The bitter irony is that the people who are most deeply caught in this trap are the ones we feel most compelled to shove deeper into it. The people who appear most "evil" are precisely those who are least able to recognize their own self-deception. In fact, from the outside, it doesn't even appear to *be* self-deception. Such people obviously know that they're doing wrong, and so the only possibility is that they must be *fundamentally morally defective.*

This is how the darkness tricks us into shoving the "bad people" deeper into the abyss, convinced that we're behaving righteously. After all, they are *fundamentally* defective, and so there's no point in trying to be kind.


---

We have *no idea* that we're doing this — or rather, that knowledge is so incredibly deeply buried that the very suggestion feels preposterous; almost insulting. We are not *provoking* the darkness in others; we are valiantly *fighting* it. If this deepens their self-deception, that can hardly be blamed on us. If anything, it is evidence that they are every bit as bad as we feared, and thus must fight even harder. But the truth is, the only reason we ever perceive other people as *fundamentally defective* is so that we can perpetrate precisely this ruse.



This is the hardest thing to describe. 


---
---

If you wish to defeat the evil in the world, you must first defeat the evil in your own mind. But why?

Evil is a kind of mind-virus. It shields people from fully perceiving the *life* in their victims — be they other people, animals, or nature at large. It is what allows people to pollute in the name of profit; to subjugate others for their own benefit; to ignore the plight of the dispossessed, and — perhaps surprisingly — to hate other people for engaging in these atrocities. But how could hating "bad people" ever be wrong?

If you look carefully enough into your own mind while feeling *contempt* for another person— that is, the sense that they are *fundamentally defective*, and that you are *intrinsically superior* — you'll discover that something in you secretly wants to shove them deeper *into* the abyss; further into the very confusion that enables their misbehavior in the first place. Why? Because the virus that lives in them lives within you, too — and the only way it can survive is by hiding itself from your conscious mind. So it tricks you into pushing others deeper into the clutches of their virus, so that you can prove to yourself that it exists only in them, and not in yourself.

Every one of us knows that by being unkind to our enemies, we are only liable to make them dig in their heels and become *worse* people. But we also know that if we do this cleverly enough, we can pin the blame entirely on them. We are only *fighting evil*, after all — and how could that ever be wrong? But our enemy can sense the self-deception inherent in our behavior, even though we cannot — and this is what makes them dig in their heels. They can sense that we are lost in the very delusion that we are viciously judging *them* for, which of course they cannot tolerate.

At the conscious level, we are convinced that we only have the best of intentions — and the fact that they cannot see this only proves that they are indeed fundamentally defective, thereby justifying our contempt. But a deeper part of us knows better. It knows that by simply perceiving others as fundamentally defective, we will *necessarily* darken the world — because this is an inherently malicious attitude. Yet we convince ourselves that if we just cover it up with noble enough thoughts — such as the conviction that we are really fighting evil — that this will somehow negate its ill effects, thereby creating a positive outcome. It is pure self-deception.

This is the hardest thing to understand about evil. It (almost) never *feels* evil. It always feels justified, or even righteous. That's because we are only paying attention to our *thoughts*, and ignoring the deeper part of us that actually *knows*. The whole trick of the darkness is to make us turn away from this deeper aspect of ourselves. It's not that "bad people" *can't* perceive the life in their victims; it's that there's a kind of smokescreen that hides this perception from their conscious minds. Until we understand the nature of this smokescreen, we cannot help but reinforce it — because it is precisely the *same* mechanism that tricks us into hating them for it.

It is an *impossibly* clever ruse. The darkness makes us perceive our enemies as *fundamentally defective* precisely so that we will feel okay smothering their inner Light by convincing ourselves that they do not have any — which is *exactly* the trick it is using to control them. And every time any one of us falls into this sinister trap, we induce the same tendency in everyone else, be they friend or foe. On the surface, we may believe that we're enemies, but at a much deeper level, our darkness is secretly allied. As long as we feel even the slightest trace of malice, contempt, or self-righteousness toward *anyone*, we are fighting for team darkness without realizing it.

This is how evil spreads without any of us recognizing our own complicity. The vast majority doesn't even feel dark. It just feels like business as usual. There are countless ways in which we skirt our conscience, pretending either that we can't hear it or that we don't have to listen. Every one of us does this, whether we realize it or not. We all engage in subtly (or not-so-subtly) self-serving behaviors that we don't recognize as such — at least, consciously. But a deeper part of us always knows — and as much as we convince ourselves that it doesn't impact the world, it somehow *always* leaks out, thereby darkening it, and enticing others to do the same. It is this cumulative self-deception that we feel as the "wrongness" of the world, and that makes us feel entitled to inject just a tiny bit more.

Again, it's not that "bad people" don't know that they're doing wrong. Part of them knows *perfectly well,* of course — but this knowledge is carefully shielded from conscious self-reflection, so that it doesn't *feel* wrong. To the degree that we feel compelled to fight *them* instead of the parasite that enables their profound confusion, we are under its sway ourselves, and can only amplify its effects. This is a subtle point that deserves clarification. Often, fighting the parasite does indeed manifest as fighting people, but it carries a very different signature, and this makes all the difference in the world. People can *tell* when you are fighting from the Light.

Thus, even our most noble-sounding projects can result in tremendous harm — though it often manifests in locations distant in time and space, so that we can easily convince ourselves that they are "unfortunate side-effects" that couldn't have been predicted, and therefore aren't our fault. If you want to know whether a project will ultimately produce harm or good, you need only look into the minds of its proponents. It's not that genuinely well-intentioned projects always produce good, but those rooted in self-deception *always* cause a net harm, which could have been avoided if we'd simply learned to be honest with ourselves.




The mythical battle between good and evil takes place at the level of our subconscious minds — and any time we feel malice, contempt, or even self-righteousness, we are secretly taking the side of the darkness while waving the banner of good. Simply by taking this side, we become a beacon of darkness for others, secretly luring them into 




But the truth is that we secretly *want* this, because the worse they get, the more we are "forced" to escalate our righteous wrath — the most delicious feeling of all. This behavior creates new evil — but we never admit this to ourselves. We tell ourselves that we are not creating *new* evil, but only exposing the evil already there.

Think back to a time when you skirted your own conscience — that is, acted against your own deepest values by convincing yourself that it was okay to do so. We've all done this, whether we know it or not. In that moment, part of you knew *perfectly well* that you were harming the world for your own benefit. Yet your mind concocted a clever story to act as a kind of smokescreen; a way to muddy the water so that you could plausibly deny any knowledge of what you really were up to — so that in a sense, even *you* didn't know. It is a bizarre schism of mind; one in which you simultaneously *know* and yet somehow *do not* — and it is responsible for *all the evil there ever was*. Our examples may differ in degree, but not in kind.

It's impossible to overstate just how much of human activity takes place from within this state of self-deception — or just how much harm it causes. Consciously, we may only have the best of intentions. Yet part of us secretly knows better. We know, *even as we're doing it,* that our behavior will darken the world; but because we've proven to ourselves that it will somehow be a "net good," we think it's safe to override this little voice. What does it know? Then, when our behavior inevitably *does* darken the world, the effects are usually so distant in time and space that we can plausibly deny any connection to it — at least, consciously. We then use the excuse of a darker world to justify even *more* self-deceptive behavior, telling ourselves that it's necessary to "fight evil." This is what we tell ourselves, but again, *part of us always knows.*


We recognize when other people are lost in this state — we call it "evil" — yet we never notice when we ourselves are. Perhaps the most striking example of this is when we mock and shame our political enemies.


It is impossible to know, in any given situation, whether your behavior will *actually* be a net benefit or harm to the world — and it is precisely this difficulty that the darkness exploits. We tell ourselves that all we have to do is to calculate a little more carefully, when actually our entire premise is built on quicksand.



When we encounter another person in this maddening state of self-deception, our first instinct is often to attack them for it. But here's what we can't see.

---
---



~~How many ventures have been started with the best of intentions, only to leave the world in a darker state? If you could peer into the minds of their originators, in nearly every case you would find that those "good intentions" were only skin-deep, failing to factor in a much broader vision of "goodness" that every one of us can sense deep down, if only we listened carefully enough.~~

Why is it so hard to defeat the evil in the world? What if nearly everything we're doing to "fight" it is secretly strengthening it?

People are only able to cause harm due to a kind of self-deception. Part of them knows _perfectly well_ that they are doing wrong, but this knowledge is carefully shielded from conscious self-reflection, so that it doesn't _feel_ wrong. All they consciously hear are their own clever justifications. It is a bizarre schism of mind; one in which they simultaneously _know_ and yet somehow _do not_. It is this shadowy mechanism that is responsible for _all the evil there ever was_.

We rightly abhor this state in others, but the truth is that every one of us knows it intimately well ourselves. 

The examples we're aware of are just the tip of the iceberg. The vast majority are hidden from our conscious minds, to preserve our self-image.

Every time any one of us engages in it, we induce the same tendency in everyone else.

Perhaps the most surprising example is this: any time we perceive others as *fundamentally morally defective* — or ourselves as *intrinsically superior* — we are engaged in profound self-deception. The deepest part of us can perceive our commonality with others, and recognizes that the "evil" in them lives within us too, but this recognition grates on us. So our mind shields this perception from us, so that we feel licensed to treat them with contempt.

Part of us knows that our contempt is only liable to make them dig in their heels and become worse people, but we secretly *want* this, because it makes us look better by comparison. If we knew we that were doing this, it would defeat the whole purpose, and so we hide it from ourselves *even harder*, until there is no trace of knowledge in our conscious minds. Yet our target can subconsciously sense that we're lost in the very self-deception that we're viciously judging *them* for — and this is precisely why it works.

By treating them with contempt, we are subconsciously telegraphing to them that *darkness is the way.* They perceive us as "evil" for precisely the same reason we see them that way, which makes them feel even less compunction for their misbehavior. And we are secretly *inducing* this perception in them, so that we can use it as proof that they are fundamentally defective, thus licensing escalation. After all, any decent person would have recognized our *good intentions.*

This is only one of an infinite number of ways that our darkness leaks out of our minds while convincing us that we are doing "good."


---

When we treat people with contempt, part of us knows that our behavior is only likely to shove them deeper into the abyss; to make them _worse_ people, and to thereby darken the world as a whole. But we convince ourselves that it is somehow "for the greater good." Our target can subconsciously sense our self-deception — the very thing that we're viciously judging _them_ for — and it makes them perceive us as evil for precisely the same reason we see them that way. This compels them to dig in their heels, which we then take as proof that we were right about them: after all, any decent person would have used this opportunity to repent, or at least self-reflect. But the truth is that something in us intentionally provoked this outcome, in order to preserve our own self-image as "good people."

Deep down, we know that a "good person" would never knowingly darken the world to bolster their own self-image, and so we must hide this knowledge from ourselves at any cost. Thus, we almost never realize that we're doing it. But ironically, the less we realize it, the more self-deceptive it is, and therefore the better it works. This is why contempt for our enemies is the surest sign that we are hiding something from ourselves — the very _opposite_ of what that sentiment seems to be telling us. It is nearly impossible to believe that simple _contempt_ for "bad people" makes the world darker — and this is exactly why it works.

If you want to know whether you're engaged in self-deception, you cannot simply listen to your thoughts. They will _always_ convince you otherwise. But there is a deeper part of you that _knows_. It is always available to us, if only we choose to look. The problem is that we rarely choose to look.



---

Humans are masters of self-deception. Nowhere is this more obvious than in our treatment of people who we consider enemies. We show them cruelty — if only mildly — telling ourselves that we are "teaching them a lesson" or "putting them in their place" or some such thing. You know the feeling — the one of self-righteous indignation. Part of us knows that this behavior will only make them _worse_ people: that they will see _us_ as evil and dig in their heels, convinced of their own righteousness. We secretly _want_ this, because it proves that they are the bad guys. This is what we are ultimately after, whether we know it or not. We _need_ other people to be the "bad guys" in order to keep hiding from our own self-deception — so we do everything in our power to ensure that they _stay_ the "bad guys," but do it in ways that appear noble on the surface.

Do we know that we are doing this? Yes and no. This is the hardest thing to describe. Part of us knows _perfectly well_ that this behavior is only increasing the "net darkness" in the world — but this knowledge is hidden behind an astonishing array of clever justifications, acting like a smokescreen — so that in another sense, we really do _not_ know. It is this bizarre schism of mind, in which we simultaneously _know_ and yet somehow _do not_, that is the secret behind _all the evil there ever was._

---

In fact, the conflation of "kind" with "nice" is a byproduct of our darkness; an excuse not to do the right thing when it becomes hard.

---
---

There is an aspect of our minds that clearly knows right from wrong. We tell ourselves that it's safe to override it, by substituting our own definition of "good" — after all, _we_ are the ones in charge here, and it has no authority. We think that if we just believe this strongly enough, that it will magically become true, and we will never have to confront this betrayal of our conscience. Every one of us does this, whether we know it or not. In fact, it is those of us who are least aware of it that are most engaged in it. The more we ignore our conscience, the quieter it gets, until we no longer even realize that we have one. It becomes the stuff of myth; a fairy tale with no hold on us — but part of us always secretly knows better.

See, it never actually goes anywhere; we just become increasingly skilled at overlooking it. Part of us knows _perfectly well_ that we are doing wrong — according to our own deepest standards — but we somehow shield this knowledge from conscious self-reflection. It's not that it becomes _unconscious_, per se: it's always perfectly accessible to our conscious minds, if only we choose to look. We just _choose not to look_. This results in a paradoxical state of mind; a bizarre schism, in which we simultaneously _know_ and yet somehow _do not_. It is this very state that has enabled _all the evil there ever was._ Every misbehavior, from the tiniest unkindness to the most horrific atrocity, ultimately rests on exactly the same principle — and every time any one of us engages in it, we lower the threshold for others to do the same. This is the secret trick by which evil spreads without anyone recognizing their own complicity.

We each believe we're fighting the evil out there by unleashing our own darkness in a controlled manner, but that's not what's actually happening. The reason we hate other people for being evil is not to help free them of it — or to help anyone else, either. Instead, something in us seizes upon this chance to shove them deeper _into_ the abyss; further into the very confusion that enables their misbehavior in the first place. Why? Because the more darkness that exists "out there," the easier it becomes to hide from it "in here." The darkness in our minds _needs_ us to darken the world, to remain hidden from our minds — but it must find a way to do so that comports with our self-identity. And since most of us self-identify as "good people," we can't just go around being cruel to innocent people or victims. No; we must be cruel to the _bad people._

This is why we mock, shame, and contemptuously judge our political enemies. We know that it will only make them dig in their heels, but we secretly want this, because it proves us right about them. After all, any decent human being would have seen that we were only _fighting evil_ and repented, or at least introspected. Their recalcitrance proves that they are indeed _fundamentally defective_ — and thus nothing we could have done would have helped. They are _beyond_ help. We're not creating _new_ evil; we're just exposing the evil already there. We're practically doing the world a _favor._ But something in us knows better. It's not that mocking or shaming are _inherently_ wrong — but we almost always infuse them with _contempt_; the sense that we are _intrinsically superior_, and thus justified in whatever we do. This secretly signals to our enemy that we're under the sway of the very self-deception that we're viciously judging _them_ for, which  makes them perceive _us_ as evil for precisely the same reason we see them that way, compelling them to fight back. This is on purpose. It is precisely by flashing them our inner darkness that we provoke them into behavior that we can use against them.

Why does our contempt signal that we're in the grip of self-deception? It's because the deepest part of us knows that we're not _fundamentally_ superior to anyone — and so any time we pretend to be, it is an unmistakable sign of self-deception operating. In this state, we _always_ use our superiority as an excuse to engage in _some_ kind of self-serving behavior that we do not recognize as such. Okay, but how do _they_ know this? It's because at the most fundamental level, their mind works in exactly the same way as ours — and both we and they know this. This is very difficult to describe. Part of us can always perceive the Light in others, no matter how well hidden. It also sees that they can see ours; and that they can
_see_ that we can see this, etc. This pattern, where we know something, and they know that we know, and we know that they know that we know, etc., is sometimes called

If we could recognize our enemy as a fellow human in the grip of a powerful self-deception — one that we ourselves are highly susceptible to — then we could never perpetrate this ruse. Our darkness therefore does something clever: it makes use perceive their evil as _intrinsic_ to their minds. In other words, we see them as _fundamentally_ defective people. 


---

It is nearly impossible to talk a person out of this state — or to even convince them that they're in it. This is increasingly true the deeper they are stuck. Beyond a certain point, we don't even bother trying: we simply perceive them as _evil_ and feel the need to viciously attack them for it. But this almost always backfires. They tend to dig in their heels, convinced that _we're_ the evil ones. This not only _decreases_ the chance that they will confront their self-deception, but generally _strengthens_ that capacity. Where did we go wrong? It's not merely that we were firm or even fierce. That is sometimes necessary. But the moment we saw them as _fundamentally defective_, something else took control of our minds. We felt the powerful urge to shove them deeper into the abyss, where they belong — but we found a way to dress this up as righteous. Our target could subconsciously sense that we were in the grip of the very self-deception that we were viciously judging _them for_. Of _course_ they couldn't tolerate it. They were perceiving _genuine darkness_ in us — which we _wanted_ them to see, precisely so that we could perpetrate this ruse.

You see, the deepest part of us knows that we are not _intrinsically_ superior to anyone — and so the only way we can feel _contempt_ for them is by shielding this knowledge from ourselves. In other words, it is _profound_ self-deception — and it signals to our target that we are caught in the very trap that we're viciously judging _them_ for, 

But if you look carefully enough into your mind while behaving this way — and this is _hard_ — you will discover that something in you secretly _intended_ this outcome. By treating them with contempt, you signaled to them that you're caught in the grip of the very delusion that you're viciously judging _them_ for, knowing that this would bait them into behavior that you could use against them. 

Why do we do this? Because the more evil we can make our enemies, the easier it becomes to hide our own self-deception from ourselves. This itself is an act of profound self-deception — and the one that our culture is least aware of.

We are shoving each other into the abyss in order to prove how righteous we are.

Your target subconsciously recognizes this, even if you consciously don't — and it is _this_ that convinces them to dig in their heels.

It's a fascinating process to watch; almost like we're trying to pull a fast one over reality. Part of us knows that this can never work, but that doesn't stop us from trying. ("Get away with it")

It's impossible to overstate just how much of our seemingly well-intentioned agendas are ultimately rooted in some kind of self-deception.

---

Humans have a nearly-unlimited capacity for self-deception. Every one of us engages in some kind of self-serving behavior that we do not recognize as such, and that we would immediately put an end to if forced to confront it. We may not realize that we do this, but it is those of us who are least aware of it that are most caught up in it. What allows it to continue is that knowledge of this behavior exists in a kind of limbo state. Part of us knows _perfectly well_ that we are doing wrong — according to our own deepest standards — but that knowledge is carefully shielded from conscious self-reflection, so that in another sense, we genuinely _do not_ know. All we hear are our own clever justifications. It is this paradoxical state — this bizarre schism of mind, in which we simultaneously _know_ and yet somehow _do not_ — that has enabled _all the evil there ever was._ Every misbehavior, from the tiniest unkindness to the most horrific atrocity ever committed, ultimately rests on exactly the same principle — and every time any one of us engages in it, we lower the threshold for others to do the same. This is the secret trick by which evil spreads without anyone recognizing their own complicity.

When we encounter another person in this state, we feel the urge to viciously attack them for it, as if to teach them a lesson. [...]

Why do we do this? Because the more we can reinforce the self-deception in others, the easier it becomes to overlook our own. It is a defense mechanism, shielding us from aspects of ourselves that we are not yet ready to confront. This is the _only_ reason we ever contemptuously judge others. It's not judgement itself that's wrong. If judgement simply means wise discernment, then _of course_ it is helpful. But the darkness in our mind seizes upon this opportunity to inject itself into our interaction, hoping that we won't notice — and usually, we don't. It can be an _incredibly_ subtle thing — but no matter how carefully we hide it, it _always_ ends up darkening the world. Again, part of us secretly knows this, but we have a powerful incentive to hide it from ourselves. This, in turn, makes others treat _us_ with contempt, which we do not tolerate for exactly the same reason that they couldn't tolerate ours. Round and round it goes, with each round opening up new avenues for self-deception. The more darkness we see "out there," the easier it becomes to perceive our own darkness as righteous.

We are not actually fighting our enemies; we only _think_ we are. In truth, we are secretly helping each other hide from our own darkness. But now consider this from the perspective of the darkness. It's almost as though it is using humanity as a vehicle to spread itself, by convincing us each that we are valiantly fighting it. This is something you can learn to perceive directly. Any time you feel malice, contempt, or self-righteousness toward anyone, you can actually _feel_ the darkness in your own mind reaching out toward theirs in a kind of "secret handshake." You and they may be enemies on the surface, but under the covers, all of our darkness is secretly allied. In fact, they are more than just allied. It is as though they are the very same entity; an intelligent, even _sentient_ entity, that knows exactly how to manipulate each of us toward its sinister ends. This is more than just a metaphor. There is but one darkness, distributed across all of our minds — and until you learn to evict it from your own, you can _only_ reinforce it in others, flawlessly convinced that you're fighting it. It is an _impossibly_ clever trap.

Why is there so much darkness in the world? How are people able to cause so much harm without apparent compunction? They do it by closing off their hearts; suppressing their humanity. It's as though a dark veil has been placed over their consciousness, shielding them from fully perceiving the _life_ in their victims — be they other people, animals, or nature herself. This enables them to cause harm without feeling the full impact of their behavior. Part of their mind knows _perfectly well_ that they are doing wrong, but this knowledge is carefully hidden from conscious self-reflection, so that it doesn't _feel_ wrong. All they hear are their own clever justifications. It is a bizarre schism of mind; a form of profound self-deception — and it has enabled _all the evil there ever was._

We hate other people for engaging in this state, but the truth is that every one of us is familiar with it ourselves. Think back to a time when you skirted your own conscience, pretending either that you couldn't hear it or that you didn't have to listen. We've all done this. Our examples may differ in degree, but not in kind. In this darkened state, we license ourselves to get away with self-serving behaviors that we would otherwise recognize as going against our own deepest values. You may be aware of having done this before, but the examples we can consciously recall are only the tip of the iceberg; only those that our subconscious allows us to see. In truth, we engage in this state _far_ more often than we realize.

We tell ourselves that the reason we hate this state in others is to _combat_ their darkness, but this is itself profound self-deception.

Why is it so hard to defeat the evil in the world? What if nearly everything we're doing to fight it is secretly strengthening it?

There is but one darkness in the world, and it is shared across all of our minds. We never notice it in ourselves, but easily recognize it in others — who we then feel compelled to viciously attack, convinced that we're righteously fighting it. But part of us secretly knows better. It knows that by being cruel, we will only make them dig in their heels, thereby darkening the world further. Isn't that how it usually goes? When we treat other people with malice, don't they tend to double down and fight back? We tell ourselves that this isn't our fault: they are _evil_, after all, so _of course_ they would behave this way when confronted with our overwhelming goodness.

But that's not what's actually happening. If you look carefully enough — and this is _hard_ — you will find that the darkness in your own mind is secretly telegraphing itself to them, to show them that you are under the sway of the very sickness that you are viciously judging _them_ for, so that they will perceive _you_ as evil for exactly the same reason you see them that way, thereby compelling them to fight back. The whole thing was orchestrated by the darkness in both of your minds. But from your perspective, you are acting righteously. You are actually feeling the malevolent urge to shove another being deeper into the abyss; further _into_ the very confusion that enables their misbehavior in the first place, by telling yourself that they deserve it. But how could anyone "deserve" to be pushed further into the arms of humanity's ultimate nemesis? To be clear: you don't do this because you're a _bad person_, but because the darkness is infinitely more clever than any of us can fathom. It knows how to manipulate each one of us into harboring it in a way that we feel convinced is necessary — in fact, that we never recognize as dark in the first place. That's the thing: evil never actually _feels_ evil.

Any time you feel the slightest trace of malice, contempt, or self-righteousness toward anyone for any reason; or perceive yourself as one of the precious few "good guys" valiantly fighting the hordes of evil, this is what is secretly happening — and it _always_ darkens the world, one way or another. Simply by perceiving other people as _fundamentally defective_, or seeing the darkness as _intrinsic_ to their minds — in short, _contempt_ — the rest is all but guaranteed. In this state, the darkness in your mind is acting like a powerful beacon, secretly inviting the darkness in others to join the fray. It is a kind of secret handshake between your darkness and theirs. You may be enemies on the surface, but under the covers, our darkness is always allied. Your allies will feel the violent urge to join your noble mission, while your enemies will feel compelled to fight back. Even bystanders will feel the dark desire to choose sides and attack _something._ This is how the darkness gains dominion over our world, with none of us recognizing our own complicity. We only recognize it when _other_ people do it.

I used to think that kindness meant being nice. It wasn't until a few mushroom trips, as well as significant experience with meditation, that I realized that this is a false equivalence — and a dangerous one, at that.

Have you ever skirted your conscience — done something that you told yourself was okay, even though part of you secretly knew better? It's okay to admit it. All of us have done this. In fact, it is those of us who are least aware of it that are most engaged in it. What I was shown was that I partake in such self-deception _far_ more often than I realize. The examples I'm aware of are just the tip of the iceberg; only the ones that my subconscious allows me to see, to protect my self-image as a "good person." In truth, my mind is _constantly_ searching for ways to gain an edge for myself, the world be damned. This goes directly against my deepest values — but it never _feels_ like this; it always feels like I'm behaving in a completely reasonable and righteous way. I never notice just how much of my reasoning is _motivated_ reasoning — even when I'm trying to notice exactly that.

I was shown that every time I lie to myself like this, I subtly darken the world as a whole. My willingness to overlook my own self-deception secretly invites others to do the same. This results in a kind of domino effect, which can circle the globe _far_ faster than I would have believed possible.

Yet I tell myself that my behavior is innocent and harmless — and that if I just believe this fervently enough, it will magically become true.

I like to believe that I'm reasoning from first principles, and accounting for all the evidence, but my reasoning is almost always _motivated_ reasoning.
