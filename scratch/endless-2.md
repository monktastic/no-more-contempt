[Claude: The piece now has the feel of something that could genuinely change how people see conflict and "evil" in the world. Really impressive work.]

Let's start with a small example.

When we mock and shame our enemies, part of us secretly *wants* them to dig in their heels, so that we can mock and shame them harder. But we mustn't be too obvious about this, or else they would see through our ruse and refuse to take the bait. Moreover, we must hide this motive from our own conscious minds, or else we'd realize we have no grounds to escalate.

They don't dig in their heels because we mocked and shamed them; they do it because we're baiting them while pretending that we're not.

There are situations where this is obvious to you


---
---



Bring to mind the "bad people" of the world—whomever you think is the cause of all our problems. Don't you feel at least a little bit of *contempt* for them—the sense that they're somehow *fundamentally defective*, and quite unlike yourself?

The truth is, any action you take from this place will only *darken* the world, even if it looks noble on the surface. Why?

When you feel contempt, what's actually happening is that you're revealing the darkness in your own heart. You *know* this will make your enemy perceive you as slightly evil, 


---
---

There's a part of our minds that *needs* evil to exist in others, because the evil "out there" helps us overlook the darkness in ourselves. We therefore have a perverse incentive to *create* more evil in the world while hiding the fact that we're doing this. But how on Earth could we create evil without looking bad ourselves?

The astonishing answer is that it simply requires *seeing others as evil*. By seeing another person as evil, you're daring them to prove you right, so that you can justify more contempt towards them. It is a fundamentally malicious attitude disguised as righteous, and this itself is enough to provoke anyone but a saint into proving you right. It is a self-fulfilling prophecy, and it is a form of evil.

Part of us knows we're doing this, but we hide this fact from ourselves. We therefore know how it's possible for a person to commit evil even as their conscious mind is flawlessly convinced they're doing good. 



> so that you'll be justified in unleashing the full extent of your righteous wrath. 

---
---

Sometimes, even when we're *sure* we're acting from our goodness, we're actually acting out our dark sides. When that happens, we end up darkening the world even as we're convinced we're saving it.

It's possible to punish our enemies out of malice or out of compassion, and the two will produce *drastically* different long-term results. The actions may *look* nearly identical, and even produce similar short-term effects, such as silencing our enemies. But something still lingers; something you can't quite name but which every one of us senses—and it is *because* we can't name it that it persists in our world.

It is how we can be wrong about which intention we're acting from.



---
---

Think back to a time when you skirted your conscience—acted against your own deepest values while pretending it was okay. In that moment, part of you knew perfectly well that you were doing wrong, but you shielded that knowledge from conscious awareness, so that it didn't *feel* wrong. All you could hear were your own clever justifications. Knowledge of your wrongdoing existed in a kind of limbo state, in which you simultaneously *knew* and yet somehow *didn't.*

It is this state of self-deception that has enabled *all the evil there ever was.* Even the worst person is only able to cause harm because part of their mind is shielding them from fully perceiving the *life* in their victims in exactly the same way. This suggests there may be a deeper part of them that their behavior must be shielded *from.* It turns out we can always perceive this part—what we might call their *inner Light*—but we hide it from ourselves using exactly the same trick. Why?

Part of us needs evil people to exist, because their existence helps us hide our own darkness from ourselves. This creates a perverse incentive to not only see evil in others, but to reinforce it; driving it deeper into their minds until there's no doubt it is *inherent*—thus proving they were already beyond help, and that we did nothing wrong. It is a fiendishly clever ruse—but for it to work, we must never suspect we're doing it. Now, how on Earth do we execute a plan that we aren't even aware of?

The astonishing answer is that *harboring contempt is enough*. This dark sentiment telegraphs our desire to shove others deeper into the abyss to prove they belong there; to smother their Light in the name of good. It is a profoundly malicious intent disguised as righteous—and this alone is enough to drive them into the arms of their darkness while preventing us from seeing that we caused it. We were only fighting evil, after all—and how could that ever be wrong?

The darkness tricks us into extinguishing Light from this world


We are delivering our enemies directly into the hands of humanity's ultimate nemesis

If we could see this clearly, we would instantly recognize that it's as malevolent as *anything that has ever happened*. The darkness has seduced us in just the right way, ensuring that we spread it while flawlessly convinced we're fighting it. The only reason we don't see this is that we numb ourselves in *exactly* the same way as the people we condemn—not realizing that this numbness is itself the very essence of evil. To hate your enemies for falling into this trap is to fall into this trap—and to thereby spread it.



This bears repeating. Part of us is *knowingly* extinguishing the Light in our enemies, aided by the fact that (1) our culture still calls it righteous, and (2) our intention is impossible to prove. It is as chillingly malevolent as *anything that has ever happened*—and the only reason we don't feel the abject horror of it is that we numb ourselves in exactly the way the "bad people" do. We call this numbness *good* when it's directed at our enemies, even though the numbness itself is the very essence of evil. It is infectious, and it spreads without concern for whom its next victims will be.

The craziest part is that we didn't even have to *do* anything to spread it. Our attitude alone was enough, even though we weren't aware of it—or more accurately, *because* we weren't aware of it. Remember, the only way people can do wrong is by entering this unconscious state; and the only reason we enter that state is for this reason. Being in that state is thus a far more reliable indicator of our true motives than anything we say, do, or even *think*—and it carries a certain "signature" that others can subconsciously detect, which is how it secretly spreads.

This results in a vast network of darkness operating just beneath our conscious thresholds, directing the course of events *far* more than does the activity we're consciously aware of. Actions that are *provably good* on the surface can powerfully transmit the darkness through chains of humans who are confident they are helping.



A huge fraction of human behavior contains subtle traces of contempt, which wreaks invisible havoc on other minds, cascading outwards like an infection, darkening the world in ways that we deny any connection to. This darker world then licenses more self-serving behavior, resulting in a downward spiral that nobody feels responsible for. It is always someone else's fault.

The darkness is using humanity as a vehicle to spread itself.

The darkness is manipulating us, tricking us into spreading it while convincing us we're fighting it. Its true origin always lies just beyond conscious reach.



It's as though the darkness operates on a hidden channel of communication, acting beneath our conscious thresholds. Politicians lie, CEOs cheat, bankers steal, all while their words (and thoughts) tell a different story; one in which they're the saviors. Every action they take from this place subtly chips away at the world, paving the way for more corruption. Then we turn around and hate them for it, never detecting that our hatred has exactly the same purpose: to darken the minds of others, turning the world into a place where our own selfish agendas become increasingly justified or necessary.

Put another way, 

This is nearly impossible to admit to ourselves


We don't do this because we're bad; we do it because we're *hurting*—and yet this doesn't make it any less sinister. Part of us can literally see the Light in our enemies, and is knowingly snuffing it out, expecting to get away with it. It is as chillingly malevolent as *anything that has ever happened*, and the only reason we don't feel the visceral horror of it is that we numb ourselves in *exactly* the way the "evil people" do.



—which we do, because our culture is still designed around the principle of letting this invisible darkness operate. I secretly agree to overlook yours if you overlook mine, and we call ourselves "allies."

It contains the kernel of 





[Two things: (1) the profound malevolence; (2) the only winner is the Darkness]

It's as though the darkness has used us both as vehicles to spread itself. Both parties will walk away feeling more justified in their perspective, making them less likely to notice the self-serving aspects of their own actions and agendas. The darkness has embedded itself deeper into both minds, even as each is more convinced they are *free* of it. It is the perfect crime, because neither party has any idea they participated in it.


It's as though the darkness is using us as vehicles for its transmission, beneath our conscious thresholds. The only winner in this interaction is *the darkness itself*.


Simply by harboring the darkness *beneath our conscious thresholds,* we've effectively ensured its spread—and this isn't even its subtlest vector of transmission. There are countless ways we benefit ourselves at the world's expense, justifying them as harmless or even necessary—and yet every time we do so, we reinforce that same tendency in everyone else, which we then blame them for, in a vicious cycle. The darkness is *infectious*—and none of us ever realize when we're the ones spreading it.






This is how the darkness tricks us into strengthening its grip on our world while we're flawlessly convinced we're helping. Contempt is a clear signal that our darkness is plotting a way to inject itself into the world in a way that escapes our notice, which we can then blame on others, and use as an excuse for even more. This doesn't even require direct contact with our enemies, or anyone at all. The darkness infuses itself into our behavior, which invisibly carries into the world.

It is the *perfect crime,* because there's not a shred of evidence—either in the world or in our own minds—that we've done anything wrong. In fact, the immediate results often appear to be *good*—such as when we dominate our enemies. Part of us knows that we've merely driven their darkness underground, where it will fester, eventually erupting in a form that will require even more violence to suppress—but by then, any connection to our own behavior will have been lost; and anyway, violently defeating this new threat will be fun. There is *nothing* more primally satisfying than being forced to unleash the full extent of our righteous wrath.

There are *countless* behaviors we engage in, which we're certain are noble, 

the surest sign of our own infection is our eagerness to contemptuously judge *others* for falling victim to it.



When we mock and shame our enemies, it's not our behavior itself that causes them to dig in their heels—it's that little something extra we mix into our behavior; something that we can't quite put our finger on, and that we thus feel no complicity for. We create clever agendas that we can *prove* will save the world—and although deep down we know they're rooted in selfish intent, we reason that this couldn't possibly matter; that the benefits will outweigh this minor flaw. But the profound self-deception required to maintain this lie *ensures* that it will result in a net harm.

None of this is visible to our conscious minds. The world simply grows darker by the day while we're all left scratching our heads. The only possible explanation is that there are fundamentally awful people out there ruining it for the rest of us, whom we must fight even harder. Or perhaps we are *all* intrinsically greedy and selfish—in which case there is nothing to be done. Either way, the darkness accomplishes its sinister goal: extinguishing the Light from this world.

This is why our culture fetishizes rationality and intellect above all else: those aspect of mind are fundamentally incapable of detecting the spreading infection until *after* it has physically manifested, by which point it is too late. We trust our thinking minds to tell us when they're lying to us, and then use more thoughts to prove that thinking is all we have. If there really were an "inner Light," we would be able to prove it; and since we can't, there's no point in looking for it.

This is the core trick of the darkness: to convince us that the Light never really existed at all; that it is a naive fairytale. That when push comes to shove, your baser instincts must prevail, because after all, this world is *inherently* lifeless, and genuine care is an illusion. This is what enables the subtlest contempt of all: that for *reality itself.* Our perception of this world as intrinsically lifeless is what enables us to exploit it in ways that are rapidly *rendering* it lifeless.

In truth, reality is wondrously, even magically, *alive*. You and I are connected in a way that transcends all attempts to conceptualize or convey it. Your irrational instinct to protect life that has no apparent relation to you is no mere glitch of biology; it is how your deeper knowing reveals itself to you, having no rational means by which to do so.




Corporations plundering nature for profit;

The evil corporations plundering nature for profit simply could not do so without the bulk of us supporting them in invisible ways


None of this would be possible without [...], and all of it is inevitable given that we are.

In your darkest hour, there is exactly *one* place you can turn to save you from the encroaching abyss.




%% The astonishing answer is that *harboring contempt is enough*. This dark sentiment telegraphs our desire to shove others deeper into the abyss for our own benefit; to smother their Light in order to prove they never had any. It is a profoundly malevolent intent disguised as a righteous one, simultaneously driving them *toward* their darkness while giving us plausible deniability for doing so. It creates proof that we were right about them; that they are inherently beyond help.
 %%

[if we just pretend hard enough,]

[Muddles the line]

—the single most clever tool the Darkness has to extinguish Light from this world.

We are sacrificing people to our primordial nemesis—




---
---

The reason it's so hard to defeat the evil in the world, or to make progress on humanity's most pressing problems, is that there's an aspect of each of our minds that is secretly working *against* us—and these aspects are not acting independently, but somehow *collaborating*.

Whether or not we take this story literally, clearly seeing what it's pointing to can forever change how we approach the problem of evil.

---

Let's start with a simple example: why do feel contempt for our enemies—the sense that they are *fundamentally* defective and beyond help? The obvious answer is *because they are*. But the truth is that part of us knows they're not, yet we need them to be, and so we try to make them appear so—which we know our contempt can accomplish.

First, why do we *need* them to be defective? Because it validates a primal story we hold, about good guys vs bad guys. The truth is that we each have little misbehaviors that we wish to keep hidden from ourselves and the world. Moreover, we are all capable of great evil under the right circumstances. Having evil enemies helps keep these awful truths hidden. Therefore, something in us has a perverse incentive to not only keep evil alive, but to *reinforce* it in others—provided we can do this in a way that appears righteous.

Second, how do we know they're not truly irredeemable? Notice that our entire plan depends on a kind of self-deception: if we were aware of doing it, it would defeat the whole point; but if we *weren't*, then how could we execute it with such ruthless precision? So we must simultaneously know and yet somehow not. But now we have the terrible knowledge of how it's possible for a person to cause great harm even while flawlessly convinced they're doing good—and it is this signature we detect in our enemies, revealing that they're only lost in the same confusion we are.

Finally, how do we know our contempt can make a person *seem* beyond help even when they're not? Because the whole purpose of contempt is to execute this very ruse. We are letting them know that part of us can *see* they still have hope, and that we're choosing to crush it anyway, knowing that we'll get away with it—because our culture still thinks of this as *righteous.* This is malevolent—and we secretly want them to know this, even as we hide it from ourselves.

It's almost as though something in our mind is *inviting* them to embrace their darkness, by showing them that true goodness is a myth; that even the so-called *good people* are willing to bend the knee to the darkness—the real source of power in this world—whenever we can get away with it; leaving them no choice but to accept. This isn't just a wild hypothesis—it's something you can learn to perceive by attending to your experience carefully enough.

The self-deception in our minds behaves almost like that mythical force called *evil.* The only way it can survive is by hiding its presence from your conscious mind, so that it feels impossibly *righteous*. It is exactly the same feeling people have when committing genuine atrocities. All the person consciously hears are clever justifications for why it's not wrong.

It doesn't actually fight the evil in others; it just pretends to, while secretly collaborating with it, thereby ingratiating itself further to both parties, in a bid to keep itself hidden from all of us. And the worst part is, it is succeeding.



---



If you do so, you will discover the secret principle behind *all the evil there ever was.* The deepest part of us can always perceive our profound interdependence with all of Life; the sense in which we are all One. But we hide this truth from ourselves, and it is this self-deception that enables us to harm the world while believing we're helping it. It leads us to believe that *perpetrating unspeakable cruelty* and *hating those who do* are moral opposites, while they actually spring from the same fundamental confusion—and thereby both reinforce it.


In this way, our capacity for self-deception behaves like that mythical force called *evil.* It lurks in our minds, tempting us into both subtle and overt misbehavior that we are incapable of recognizing as such, and which thereby invites others to do the same. It prevents us from recognizing its presence in our own minds, while simultaneously making it seem *intrinsic* to others, so that we feel compelled to treat them in ways that drive it further in. We then use their increasing darkness to license more self-serving behavior of our own, in a vicious cycle.




[This is why there's something uniquely satisfying about violently punishing evil.]

[But it's locked in a cycle of pain and confusion, just as we are.]

[The Devil speaks to you in your own voice, so that you never suspect who's really in charge]

[good people are frauds; taunt]

[There is an aspect of our mind that exists prior to the hijack.]

[, in an escalating fashion, until eventually we are forced to unleash the full extent of our righteous wrath—perhaps the most delicious feeling of all.]

[We need bad guys to exist because then we are the world's valiant saviors, and don't have to look too closely at our own flaws. Every one of us uses the darkness of the world to license subtly selfish behaviors of our own, whether we know it or not.]


---
---


Why is it that despite our best efforts, many of humanity's most pressing problems only seem to be getting worse? Why does evil seem to be on the rise? Are these due to a select group of *evil people* whom we must learn to fight with ever-more vigor? Or are humans as a whole fundamentally greedy and selfish?

The truth is far stranger than either of these options.

It turns out there's an aspect of each of our minds that is working against us. It hides itself perfectly from our consciousness, rendering us unable to even *fathom* that we might be participating. But most curiously of all, these aspects of ours are not operating independently. They are collaborating—or you could say, *conspiring*—to keep this world bound in darkness.

---

Have you ever noticed how mocking and shaming our enemies only tends to make them dig in their heels, convinced that *we're* the evil ones? We tell ourselves it's because they're *bad people*—after all, our intentions were pure, and if they couldn't see that, it only proves they're beyond help. We're thus left with no choice but to escalate, to combat their growing threat.

But something about this story seems a little too pat. If we're honest, something in us *enjoys* proving how evil our enemies are, because it validates our story of *good guys vs bad guys*, and our own role within it. But this story only works if our enemies are truly, irredeemably evil—otherwise we're just bullying people who could change, which would make us the bad guys. Moreover, there's something uniquely, primally satisfying about subjugating our enemies; violently punishing their evil. On top of that, we each have little misbehaviors that we wish to keep hidden from ourselves and others, and having a darker world helps them stay hidden.

All of this adds up to providing a perverse incentive to create _more_ evil that we must gloriously defeat in an ever-escalating cycle. The ultimate goal is to prove our enemies utterly beyond redemption, so we can finally unleash the full extent of our righteous wrath—perhaps the most delicious feeling of all. But if we knew we were doing this, it would undermine the very illusion it's meant to uphold: that we are the good guys, valiantly fighting the hordes of evil. So we would somehow have to hide from ourselves the fact that we're doing it—and how would that work? Moreover, by what mechanism could we even reinforce another person's evil? Simply asking nicely obviously wouldn't work.

Well, the fact that we know it's even possible suggests we also know they're not truly beyond help. And what better way to make someone embrace their darkness than to see that glimmer of hope and choose to extinguish it anyway—especially while pretending that this is righteous? The only improvement would be to somehow hint that we know exactly what we're doing—and that we'll get away with it—as a kind of taunt. That would escalate it from malicious to *malevolent.* 
But this presents a massive challenge: how can we perpetrate a ruse that we don't even know we're perpetrating—and more vexing still, hint to them that we *do* know it?

The answer is that part of us would have to know while another part remained completely in the dark—and this is exactly what's happening. It is a profound form of self-deception, and it is the secret mechanism behind _all the evil there ever was._

Our enemies are only able to do wrong by shielding knowledge of their wrongdoing in exactly this way—and part of us can see this. We hate them not because they're irredeemable, but because we can see they're not—and our contempt is carefully constructed to bait them into proving otherwise, so that we can sacrifice them to the darkness with the whole world's approval. This leaves them no choice but to embrace their darkness fully, thus closing the loop.

In this way, our contempt acts like a secret handshake between our darkness and theirs; ours telegraphing itself through our eyes to notify theirs that it's in control of us, thus giving theirs the perfect excuse to ingratiate itself further to them. It's showing them that true goodness is a myth; that even the so-called "good people" are ultimately frauds, willing to bend the knee to the darkness—the *real* source of power in this world—whenever they can get away with it.

---
---





The horrifying truth is that part of us *does* know—but this knowledge is carefully tucked away in a corner of our minds, so that we have plausible deniability. This makes it feel convincingly like we *don't* know. This way, when we accuse our enemies of being evil, we can secretly telegraph our malicious intent, provoking them into seeing *us* as evil, which we can then use against them—because only someone truly defective could think that about *us.*

[as a way of avoiding something we're not yet ready to see "in here"?]

---

Therefore, when we treat our enemies with contempt—that is, the pretense of being fundamentally superior to them—we are also telegraphing


our malicious intent, provoking them into seeing *us* as evil, which we can then use against them—because only someone truly defective could think that about *us.*

---


For this plan to work, it couldn't bee too obvious, or else


But part of us suspects this may be a lie. Something in us *needs* our enemies to be evil, because this validates our story of *good guys vs bad guys*—and so it does something exceptionally clever: it finds ways to *reinforce* their evil, but in ways that allow us to look good. But the most fiendish part is how it does this. 



[valiantly fighting the hordes of evil]

---
---

It is possible for an evil conspiracy to be acted out by a group of people without any of them being consciously aware of their role in it. In fact, the more aware they are of their roles, the harder it will be to keep the whole thing secret—and so the most effective conspiracies are those which are nearly entirely hidden

From the outside, the whole thing will appear intelligently orchestrated


---
---

Evil sneaks in around the edges — the places where our mental models of right and wrong differ from what we actually *know* to be right and wrong.

We mock and shame our enemies, convinced that this will somehow help the world; but part of us secretly just enjoys watching the "bad people" suffer. But so what — what difference does it make? Our malice is a private emotion, and has no effect on the outcome.

Except that part of us is secretly *ensuring* that the malice comes across. Why? We tell ourselves that we're just showing them what we're really capable of if pushed, so that they will *stop* — but we're actually egging them on. We're provoking them into seeing *us* as evil, so that they will feel compelled to fight back. This creates *new evil,* but we tell ourselves that we're merely exposing the evil already there.

We are manufacturing evidence that our enemies are *fundamentally defective* so that our hand seems increasingly forced, but hiding from ourselves the fact that we're doing this. This way, almost anything we do is justified. It becomes increasingly difficult to detect the self-serving aspects of our own actions and agendas, blended as they are with the truth. 



---


This is how the darkness spreads without any of us ever noticing our own complicity.

It's not that mocking or shaming are *inherently* wrong. There may be circumstances where they help.

There won't be even a trace of evidence that we've done any such thing. Even if we inspect our own minds — which we're unlikely to do — we will find no sign that we've been deluding ourselves. As far as we can tell, we were only fighting evil. Any benefit that may have accrued to us was purely incidental.




---
---

Evil sneaks in around the edges — the places where our mental *models* of right and wrong diverge from what we *know* to be right and wrong.

I mock and shame my enemies, convinced that I'm only "fighting evil" — but part of me secretly knows that this will only make them dig in their heels, forcing me to fight them even harder, in a vicious cycle, until finally I am compelled to unleash the full extent of my righteous wrath. This feeling — of violently punishing evil — is perhaps the most delicious of all, but it doesn't serve the purpose I think. It's actually there to help me justify my *own* self-serving behavior while hiding from myself that this is what I'm doing. This is the *real* reason I hate the "bad people."

Do I know this? Yes and no. Part of me knows *perfectly well*; but this knowledge is carefully shielded from conscious self-reflection, so that in another sense, I also don't. But while I'm not consciously aware of my own self-deception, my enemy subconsciously is — and this is why it works. They are perceiving in me *exactly* the mistake that I am contemptuously judging *them* for.

It turns out that part of me knows this, too — that even the worst person is only able to cause harm thanks to a mechanism that I myself share. The deepest aspect of my mind is always able to perceive the part of theirs that lies beneath their capacity for self-deception — in other words, the part that is *fundamentally good*. The only reason it ever feels like I am *intrinsically* superior to anyone — the "bad people" included — is to give my own darkness an excuse to exist.

It is a trick as old as time, and yet we keep falling for it. The reason is that it's *impossible* to formalize our notions of goodness. Every time we try, we leave ourselves open to "edge cases" — places where we *know* the right answer, but where our model allows us to make the wrong one. Looked at another way, it is only ever our darkness that lets us *believe* that we could formalize goodness, and for exactly this reason: it is how it keeps its foot in the door.

For example, it's not that mocking and shaming are *inherently* wrong. There may well be cases where they help — but the dark aspect of my mind knows exactly how to exploit them in a way that will ultimately darken the world, yet which nobody can *prove.* It may even lead to temporary benefit — such as suppressing evil behavior — which only further obscures the true causal mechanisms at work. It is as though the darkness has *leaked out of my mind and into the world.*

When I treat my enemies with contempt, the darkness in my mind is reaching out to to theirs as if to offer it a secret handshake. When I behave selfishly, I find other people who are cleverly justifying the same misbehavior, and we together overlook the harm we are causing. In the former case, I call them my "enemies," and in the latter, my "allies" — but in both cases, it is only our *darkness* that is allied; creating more of itself "out there" to help me justify more "in here."

There is a continual exchange of darkness occurring, though it normally operates well beneath our conscious thresholds. It is why we sometimes suspect the existence of an *evil global conspiracy* running the show from behind the scenes. The hidden aspects of all our minds are indeed conspiring; together behaving more like a *singular distributed malevolent entity*. The Christians know it as the Devil, and the Buddhists call it the Ego. It is the *primordial* evil conspiracy; the one from which all the rest originate, and to which they all ultimately report.

Every attempt to defeat it "out there" without first being free of it "in here" only ends up strengthening it, because it is secretly directed *by* it.


---



This is how the darkness spreads without anyone recognizing their own complicity. We're each completely sure that we're the "good guys" — unaware that this self-righteous attitude is the surest sign that we're unaware of the darkness lurking within ourselves. But although we are not consciously aware of it, our enemies subconsciously are — and this is *why* they dig in their heels.





This is the secret *reason* I am cruel to my enemies: the darkness in my own mind knows that it can use theirs as an excuse to burrow *deeper* into mind, but in a way that I will not object to. After all, I am only *fighting evil,* after all — and how could that ever be wrong?

Nobody can prove that I'm doing this — and that is exactly why it works.


This "plausible deniability" is enough to convince *even me* that I'm doing no wrong — but although I'm not consciously aware of my own self-deception, my target subconsciously *is*; and this is *why* they dig in their heels. They are perceiving in me *precisely* the same




---

The reason it seems so hard to defeat the evil in the world is that a part of us secretly *needs* it to exist, to serve as cover for our *own* hidden darkness. So this part of us does something astonishingly clever: it finds ways to create *more* evil, but in ways that we don't consciously recognize.

---
---

We think that hating "bad people" is a sign of the good within us, but it's actually a sign of something *much darker*.

---

Bring to mind the "bad people" of the world — those whom you believe are responsible for all the world's problems. Can you detect a subtle *contempt* for them — or perhaps a *not*-so-subtle contempt? It feels like they are *fundamentally* defective, and thus beyond help. We think this feeling is there to help us *fight* evil, but this is a dark lie.

The real reason we feel contempt is to help us justify self-serving behavior of our own. It licenses us to be cruel, which we know will only make them dig in their heels — but that's okay, because we know we can blame it on them. They are _fundamentally defective_, after all, and thus nothing we could have done would have made any difference.

We have created *new evil* in the world while cleverly absolving ourselves of all complicity. Do we *know* that we've done this? Yes and no. Part of us knows it perfectly well, but this knowledge is carefully shielded from our conscious minds, so that in another sense, we *don't* know. And what is the purpose of creating this evil? It is to help us get away with *more* — because the presence of darkness "out there" helps us disguise our *own* self-serving agendas, from even ourselves.

This is *profound* self-deception — and it is *exactly* the same trick that the "bad people" use to do what *they* do. People are only able to cause harm by hiding knowledge of their wrongdoing from themselves. It turns out we know this, too — that we're judging others for a sin that we ourselves are engaged in. But we cannot admit this to ourselves — and it is this dishonesty that our target subconsciously senses, which is *why* they dig in their heels.

It is as though the darkness in our own mind is *telegraphing* itself to them in order to provoke theirs — or you could say, to *recruit* it. We and they may be bitter enemies on the surface, but under the covers, the darkness in all our minds is secretly *allied*; together behaving like a *singular distributed malevolent entity*, conspiring to keep our world bound in the shadows.

The Christians know it as the Devil, and the Buddhists call it the Ego. It is why some suspect the existence of an evil global conspiracy running the show from behind the scenes. It is the *primordial* evil conspiracy; the one to which all the rest owe their existence, and to which they ultimately filter up. What makes it so hard to defeat is that part of it lives deep within our own minds, where we defend it to the death.

We each perceive ourselves as the valiant saviors of the world, righteously battling the hordes of evil. We divide the world into the *fundamentally* good and bad people; those who deserve our compassion and those who deserve only contempt — not realizing that this itself is the surest sign of the darkness operating within us, waiting for an opportunity to strike.

To be clear: there certainly *are* groups of people who conspire to bring great harm for their own benefit, and they *must* be stopped. But to the degree we see the evil as *intrinsic* to their minds, we are secretly *empowering* their darkness — and a deep part of us knows this.






In fact, the darkness is ultimately *nothing but* this willingness to hide our true intentions from ourselves.

In the absence of that ability, we would simply be *unable* to do wrong — and in its presence, not only can we not help but cause harm; we reinforce that same tendency in others. It is as though there is a dark network connecting each of us, communicating to itself beneath our conscious thresholds. Our conscious thoughts and actions have a relatively limited impact on the world; it is this subconscious communication that is doing most of the work.


To be clear: the vast majority of such behavior looks (and feels) nothing like evil. It mostly feels like the countless ways we seek subtle advantages for ourselves at the expense of others, while telling ourselves that we're doing no such thing — or that we deserve it.

The mere willingness to perceive another being as *fundamentally defective* is itself enough to trigger this cascade.

The trick behind evil is astonishingly clever.

When we witness darkness in the world, we feel licensed to harbor a bit of our own; whether it be by turning cold and callous, or giving ourselves special privileges, or contemptuously judging others — in particular, all those "bad people." We don't consciously recognize our own behavior as dark, but others subconsciously do — and it gives them tacit permission to do the same.

On the flip side, when we remain kind in the face of darkness — not *nice,* but *kind*, mind you — we interrupt this process. It's like a glitch in the Matrix: our ability to remain in integrity in the face of the onslaught subconsciously reminds others — both friends *and* foes — of their forgotten ability to do the same. The darkness thereby loses some of its grip on our world.

It is only the darkness that makes us equate *kind* with *nice.* Nice means pleasant and agreeable — fine qualities in most circumstances, but worse than useless in the face of evil. If the darkness convinces us that this is all kindness is, then we will abandon the one weapon we have against it. True kindness can be fierce or even violent if necessary — but it never contains even a *trace* of malice, contempt, or self-righteousness. Those are *always* signs of the darkness taking hold.

The deepest part of you knows that you are not *fundamentally* superior to anyone — the "bad people" included — and that by pretending to be, you are only telegraphing the darkness in your own mind in order to provoke theirs. Thus, any time you perceive darkness as being *intrinsic* to another mind, you can be certain that you are under the sway of your own.

The mythical fight between good and evil actually exists — but it does not take place between good and evil people. It is being subconsciously fought in every single interaction you have.

Have you noticed how hard it is to fight evil without accidentally creating more? We mock and shame our enemies, only for this to make them dig in their heels. Alas, what more could we expect from such morally defective people? And we can't simply turn the other cheek, either, as that would only embolden them. So it seems like we're stuck between a rock and a hard place.

But there's a white lie in here — one that unravels the whole sweater if pulled hard enough.

If you look carefully enough into your mind while hating your enemies — and this is hard — you'll discover that something in you secretly *wants* them to double down, so that you will be forced to unleash the full extent of your righteous wrath. At the same time, you know that if they *do*, you can blame it squarely on them: you were only fighting evil, after all — and how could that ever be wrong?

We are creating *new evil* in the world, just so we can have the delicious feeling of being *right* — but we hide this fact by telling ourselves that we're merely exposing the evil already there. This is *profound* self-deception — but it doesn't end there.

Part of us knows that our enemies are only able to do wrong by engaging in precisely the same kind of self-deception. We thus know that we're not *intrinsically* superior to them. The reason we feel contempt is to hide this fact from ourselves. We feel superior *so that* we can be cruel; shoving others deeper into the abyss —  because the worse they become, the easier it is to hide our own darkness from ourselves.

It's not that mocking or shaming are *inherently* wrong — but we almost always infuse them with contempt. And no matter how carefully we hide this — even from ourselves — it *always* ends up darkening the world.

When you act from a place of genuine service to the world, people can sense it, and it affects them in ways we can't see. The same is true when we're acting from a place that is secretly self-serving. Thus it can happen that two actions, appearing nearly identical on the surface, end up having drastically different long-term consequences. 



But it is nearly impossible to tell which is which from the outside: selfish actions can look magnanimous, and noble actions can appear cruel. In fact, most of us have a hard time telling from the *inside* — and it is this very difficulty the darkness exploits to gain dominion over our world. 

Every one of our actions lies somewhere along this continuum



---


but while we don't consciously recognize it, our enemy subconsciously *does*. In fact, this is *why* they double down: they are perceiving in us *precisely* the mistake that we are viciously judging *them* for.


---

This is *profound* self-deception — but we rarely recognize it as such. You don't even need to *hate* your enemies, per se, to trigger it. Simply by feeling contempt — that is, the sense that they are *fundamentally* defective or that you are *intrinsically* superior — you are revealing to them the darkness in your own mind, thereby provoking theirs.




— but it doesn't end there. Not only does part of us *know* that we're engaged in self-deception, but we also know that our enemy is, too — in fact, that this 



---

We're projecting a dark aura, but don't recognize this — because it *feels* impossibly righteous. We're only fighting evil, after all — and how could that ever be wrong?

The process taking place in our minds at that moment is precisely the same one that enables the "bad people" to do what *they* do. We're darkening our minds, telling ourselves stories

Something in us secretly knows that our behavior will only darken the world, but we can't admit this to ourselves — because we're benefiting from it. This is the secret principle behind *all the evil there ever was,* from the tiniest act of unkindness to the most horrific atrocity ever committed — and every time any one of us engages in it, we lower the threshold for others to do the same. 

But how could we possibly benefit from a darker world? We are, after all, *good people.*

The truth is that each of us engages in myriad forms of self-deception. We find subtle ways to benefit ourselves at the world's expense, or give ourselves special privileges that we would judge others for — but we find clever ways to justify them, so that we never notice what we're really doing. The darker the world gets, the easier it becomes to hide our own self-deception from ourselves — and so this part of us continually seeks clever ways to darken it.

We may not *think* we're giving ourselves any "special privileges," but contemptuously judging others *is* a special privilege. We would never tolerate it from others, but we don't recognize *why.* We think it's because we're "good people" who don't deserve to be judged, but it's actually because deep down we know what contempt really is: a way to provoke the darkness in others to better hide our own. Part of us knows it's wrong even as we do it, but we cannot admit this to ourselves.

(To be clear: we mean contempt for *people.* Contempt for beliefs or behaviors isn't necessarily wrong — though we almost never actually leave them at that. Similarly, judgement and outrage aren't always bad — but it's nearly impossible for us not to infuse them with contempt so that they, too, become secret vehicles of our darkness.)

The way it works is *impossibly* clever. By contemptuously judging our enemies, we're secretly telegraphing to them that we're in the grip of the very delusion that we're viciously judging them for, thus baiting them into seeing *us* as evil, which helps them feel *more* justified. This recalcitrance then convinces us that we were right about them, thus compelling us to escalate.

The key word is *helping* them feel more justified. It's not an accident. The darkness in our mind knows that by displaying itself to our enemy, it will reinforce theirs. The two humans — we and our nemesis — will walk away feeling entirely justified, even as the darkness itself strengthens in both of us, and also the world at large. We and they may be enemies on the surface, but under the covers, our darkness is secretly allied.

In fact, all the darkness in the world together behaves like a *singular malevolent distributed entity*. The Christians know it as the Devil, and the Buddhists call it the ego. It is why some suspect the existence of an evil global conspiracy running the world from behind the scenes. It is the primordial evil conspiracy; the one to which all the rest owe their existence, and to which they ultimately filter up. What makes it so hard to defeat it is that we're each protecting our own tiny sliver, convinced that it is helping us.

In truth, it is impossible to benefit the world by withholding your Love from it. This is the central lie of the Darkness, and it has an infinite variety of ways to convince us of it. Most of it looks nothing like evil. It just looks like the casual cruelty rampant in modern society; the bored indifference that lets people joke about "Darwin awards"; all the tiny lies we tell ourselves about how our work or agendas are benefiting the world. These are the *fabric* of the great conspiracy.

The only way to cause willful harm to others is to shield yourself from fully perceiving the *life* in them — be they other people, animals, or nature at large. This is as true for you as it is for the most "evil" person in the world. And every time any one of us engages this mechanism — no matter how "noble" the reason — we inevitably strengthen the same capacity in everyone else.

The only way to end the Darkness is through *kindness* — which has nothing to do with being nice. Genuine kindness can be fierce or even violent if necessary. Its only defining characteristic is that it is utterly free of self-deception. It does not perceive evil as *intrinsic* to any mind — and this "small change" makes all the difference. When the darkness is fought without even a trace of ego, it fails to find the "hook" in our own mind that it would otherwise use to justify itself, and is thereby weakened. This is the *only* way that evil is released from our world.

It can be very hard to tell from the outside whether a person is acting from ego or from genuine service to Life, though their ultimate effects are as different as night and day. The more clever the person, the longer these differences can take to appear, and the harder they can be to see — yet they never fail to manifest.

On the other hand, we can always tell this difference in intention from the *inside.* Yet we often hide this knowledge from ourselves, convinced that since *other* people cannot tell, we will get away with it. But the truth is that we never actually "get away" with anything. Sure, we can *temporarily* benefit ourselves (and our allies) at the expense of others, but it ultimately always comes crashing down — much as our biosphere is now, thanks to us treating nature as an "other." There ultimately are no "others." This is very hard to speak about.

What you ultimately are *is* all of Reality, looking at itself through countless eyes. The deepest part of you *knows* that you are not fundamentally superior to anyone — the "bad people" included — because they ultimately *are* you. It is only through an astonishing act of self-deception that we hide this knowledge from ourselves. The more we dissolve this misperception in ourselves, the more capacity we have to end it in others, because we finally see how it works.

What does it feel like to see this? You could say it feels like Love, but this is badly misleading. It is not something soft or gentle — at least, not exclusively. It can be fearsome and wrathful, and everything in-between. It cares not for your *ideas* of right and wrong, as those always come from your ego. It is something far beyond words — but it's something I know you've felt before, because it is what you ultimately *are.* It is what *all* of this ultimately is.

Thus the only way to lead us all back to the Light is to first lead *yourself* back there. The closer you get, the more your behavior naturally brings the "rest of us" back into alignment. This is a spiritual way to describe it, but I trust it can be translated into "rational" language. Regardless of how it is described, find the part of you that already knows what I'm talking about. If you stay fiercely committed to that — to the exclusion of all else — the rest will take care of itself.

May all beings be free of suffering. Amen.

---

— and by engaging in it, we reinforce this capacity in both them and everyone else. The self-deception that allows us to hide this fact from ourselves is exactly the same one that prevents them from confronting what they are doing. 

Something in us *knows* that our contempt is only liable to further darken the world. Contempt is a fundamentally malicious attitude. It signals to our enemy that 

Part of us can see this whole pattern playing out even before we initiate it — but we hide this knowledge from our conscious minds, so that we can pretend not to know. If you can just see how this process works in your own mind, you will have understood the secret behind *all the evil there ever was.*




The whole trick behind evil is to get us to withhold our love, by convincing us that it's something soft and weak and maybe even harmful in today's harsh world.

When we witness evil, we often feel the urge to give the perpetrator "a taste of their own medicine," or "put them in their place," or "teach them a lesson," etc. But if you look carefully enough into your mind while feeling this way — and this is *hard* — you'll discover that something in you knows that this will only darken the world further.

This can be *incredibly* difficult to admit. Your mind will generate flawlessly compelling stories of how your behavior will actually be a "net good." If you give in to these justifications, here's what will happen next: your target will subconsciously sense that you're caught in the very trap that you're contemptuously judging them for, and this will drive the darkness deeper *into* their minds. They will feel *more* justified in whatever storyline is driving their misbehavior.

You will secretly know that this is what's happening — but because it's impossible to *prove*, you can use it as evidence that you were right about them. You were only *fighting evil*, after all — and if it made them worse, well, that proves that they really are *fundamentally defective* and thus beyond help. You are therefore licensed to escalate.

This is an extremely subtle point. What led to this outcome wasn't merely the attempt to stop them — no matter how outwardly violent the action itself was. Instead, there was a kind of *inner violence* at work — one that's much harder to see, which is why evil still plagues our world. Contempt — the feeling of being *intrinsically superior* to others — is an inherently malicious attitude. Regardless of whom it is aimed at, its secret purpose is to darken the world.

But it never feels like that, does it? Neither to you nor to the most "evil" person who ever lived. Even if they are consciously *trying* to darken the world, it's because they perceive the outcome as being *good* or *righteous.* It's always the same trick, and it always works in the same way. Any time any one of us engages in it, no matter the reason, it has the same effect.

In its subtlest form it looks (and feels) absolutely nothing like evil. Every time we are unkind to anyone for any reason, or skirt our conscience in any other way — such as the countless ways we subtly benefit ourselves at the world's expense while telling ourselves it's okay — we are strengthening this same capacity in everyone else, whom we then judge for being "bad people," thus enabling us to hide our own self-deception from ourselves even better.

This is how the Darkness stays alive. It hides itself perfectly from our own minds while sensitizing us to its presence in others, whom we then treat with contempt, never realizing what we're actually doing. If you learn to introspect closely enough, you'll discover that contempt is like a secret handshake between your darkness and theirs — a silent agreement to keep this world bound in the shadows.

This is why people sometimes suspect the existence of an evil global conspiracy. In a certain sense, there really is one — but it is not governed by a few special individuals. The darkness is a *distributed organism*, with control centers deep within each of our minds. It is the *primordial* evil conspiracy — the one to which all the rest owe their existence, and to which they all ultimately filter up. Every attempt to defeat it without being free of it oneself only ends up reinforcing it.

To be clear, contempt for beliefs or behaviors is not always dark. 

The darkness *can* be evicted from the mind. It is like a parasite.

I cannot tell you what kindness is, but you already know it. Pure compassion is what you *are* in your innermost being. The more clearly you discover this — not as an idea, but as a direct experience — the more clearly you see it in everyone else, too; including those whom you were certain were beyond help. You see that the desire to forsake them was really a desire to forsake *yourself* — because in a profound and surprising sense, you *are* them. One Life Force, looking through countless eyes, trying to find its way back Home.





---

This is a sensitive point: on one hand, you genuinely don't know that you're doing this; but on the other, you absolutely do. If someone were to contemptuously judge you for the part of you that *knows*, it would only trigger that very same defense mechanism, thereby darkening the world. At the same time, if you are allowed to stay in the dark about this knowledge, 


---

What exactly is this phenomenon that allows us to hide knowledge of our wrongdoing from our own conscious minds? It is precisely the *same* mechanism that compels us to hate other people for engaging in it.


---
---

Imagine if someone were to excoriate you while you're in this state — that is, to viciously judge you for your obvious self-deception. Would you take it well? Of course not. No matter how right they were, part of you would recognize that they were lost in the very same trap. Who are they to judge? They don't have your best interests at heart — or really *anyone's*, despite what they may say. It's a purely egoic play, meant to make them look good while throwing you under the bus. This makes you *less* likely to own up to your misbehavior in the future — *even to yourself*.

In other words, your capacity for self-deception triggers theirs, which reinforces yours.

Do *they* know that they are doing this? Yes and no. Consciously, they really believe that they're doing the right thing. But deep down, something in them knows that their behavior will create a darker world. Although they cannot see this malintent, you certainly can — and it makes you perceive *them* as evil for precisely the same reason they see *you* that way. You now feel emboldened to be cruel to people like them in the future — because cruelty isn't actually wrong when it's directed at the "bad people." In fact, it's practically your *duty* as a "good person."

What actually happened is that the darkness in your mind — the thing that allows you to hide knowledge from yourself — acted as a lightning rod for theirs, inviting them to behave in a way that would cause both of you to increase the "net darkness" in the world. Yet you both walk away feeling like you did your best; that you were only "fighting evil."

This is how the darkness spreads without anyone recognizing their own complicity. Each of us feels like the righteous saviors of the world, not realizing that by simply harboring this complex, we are secretly inviting others to puncture our sense of moral superiority, so that they can see themselves in the same way. The key word is *inviting.* We carry this self-perception specifically *so that* we can provoke the "bad people" into behaviors that we can then judge them for.

The bitter irony is that the people who are most deeply caught in this trap are the ones we feel most compelled to shove deeper into it. The people who appear most "evil" are precisely those who are least able to recognize their own self-deception. In fact, from the outside, it doesn't even appear to *be* self-deception. Such people obviously know that they're doing wrong, and so the only possibility is that they must be *fundamentally morally defective.*

This is how the darkness tricks us into shoving the "bad people" deeper into the abyss, convinced that we're behaving righteously. After all, they are *fundamentally* defective, and so there's no point in trying to be kind.


---

We have *no idea* that we're doing this — or rather, that knowledge is so incredibly deeply buried that the very suggestion feels preposterous; almost insulting. We are not *provoking* the darkness in others; we are valiantly *fighting* it. If this deepens their self-deception, that can hardly be blamed on us. If anything, it is evidence that they are every bit as bad as we feared, and thus must fight even harder. But the truth is, the only reason we ever perceive other people as *fundamentally defective* is so that we can perpetrate precisely this ruse.



This is the hardest thing to describe. 


---
---

If you wish to defeat the evil in the world, you must first defeat the evil in your own mind. But why?

Evil is a kind of mind-virus. It shields people from fully perceiving the *life* in their victims — be they other people, animals, or nature at large. It is what allows people to pollute in the name of profit; to subjugate others for their own benefit; to ignore the plight of the dispossessed, and — perhaps surprisingly — to hate other people for engaging in these atrocities. But how could hating "bad people" ever be wrong?

If you look carefully enough into your own mind while feeling *contempt* for another person— that is, the sense that they are *fundamentally defective*, and that you are *intrinsically superior* — you'll discover that something in you secretly wants to shove them deeper *into* the abyss; further into the very confusion that enables their misbehavior in the first place. Why? Because the virus that lives in them lives within you, too — and the only way it can survive is by hiding itself from your conscious mind. So it tricks you into pushing others deeper into the clutches of their virus, so that you can prove to yourself that it exists only in them, and not in yourself.

Every one of us knows that by being unkind to our enemies, we are only liable to make them dig in their heels and become *worse* people. But we also know that if we do this cleverly enough, we can pin the blame entirely on them. We are only *fighting evil*, after all — and how could that ever be wrong? But our enemy can sense the self-deception inherent in our behavior, even though we cannot — and this is what makes them dig in their heels. They can sense that we are lost in the very delusion that we are viciously judging *them* for, which of course they cannot tolerate.

At the conscious level, we are convinced that we only have the best of intentions — and the fact that they cannot see this only proves that they are indeed fundamentally defective, thereby justifying our contempt. But a deeper part of us knows better. It knows that by simply perceiving others as fundamentally defective, we will *necessarily* darken the world — because this is an inherently malicious attitude. Yet we convince ourselves that if we just cover it up with noble enough thoughts — such as the conviction that we are really fighting evil — that this will somehow negate its ill effects, thereby creating a positive outcome. It is pure self-deception.

This is the hardest thing to understand about evil. It (almost) never *feels* evil. It always feels justified, or even righteous. That's because we are only paying attention to our *thoughts*, and ignoring the deeper part of us that actually *knows*. The whole trick of the darkness is to make us turn away from this deeper aspect of ourselves. It's not that "bad people" *can't* perceive the life in their victims; it's that there's a kind of smokescreen that hides this perception from their conscious minds. Until we understand the nature of this smokescreen, we cannot help but reinforce it — because it is precisely the *same* mechanism that tricks us into hating them for it.

It is an *impossibly* clever ruse. The darkness makes us perceive our enemies as *fundamentally defective* precisely so that we will feel okay smothering their inner Light by convincing ourselves that they do not have any — which is *exactly* the trick it is using to control them. And every time any one of us falls into this sinister trap, we induce the same tendency in everyone else, be they friend or foe. On the surface, we may believe that we're enemies, but at a much deeper level, our darkness is secretly allied. As long as we feel even the slightest trace of malice, contempt, or self-righteousness toward *anyone*, we are fighting for team darkness without realizing it.

This is how evil spreads without any of us recognizing our own complicity. The vast majority doesn't even feel dark. It just feels like business as usual. There are countless ways in which we skirt our conscience, pretending either that we can't hear it or that we don't have to listen. Every one of us does this, whether we realize it or not. We all engage in subtly (or not-so-subtly) self-serving behaviors that we don't recognize as such — at least, consciously. But a deeper part of us always knows — and as much as we convince ourselves that it doesn't impact the world, it somehow *always* leaks out, thereby darkening it, and enticing others to do the same. It is this cumulative self-deception that we feel as the "wrongness" of the world, and that makes us feel entitled to inject just a tiny bit more.

Again, it's not that "bad people" don't know that they're doing wrong. Part of them knows *perfectly well,* of course — but this knowledge is carefully shielded from conscious self-reflection, so that it doesn't *feel* wrong. To the degree that we feel compelled to fight *them* instead of the parasite that enables their profound confusion, we are under its sway ourselves, and can only amplify its effects. This is a subtle point that deserves clarification. Often, fighting the parasite does indeed manifest as fighting people, but it carries a very different signature, and this makes all the difference in the world. People can *tell* when you are fighting from the Light.

Thus, even our most noble-sounding projects can result in tremendous harm — though it often manifests in locations distant in time and space, so that we can easily convince ourselves that they are "unfortunate side-effects" that couldn't have been predicted, and therefore aren't our fault. If you want to know whether a project will ultimately produce harm or good, you need only look into the minds of its proponents. It's not that genuinely well-intentioned projects always produce good, but those rooted in self-deception *always* cause a net harm, which could have been avoided if we'd simply learned to be honest with ourselves.




The mythical battle between good and evil takes place at the level of our subconscious minds — and any time we feel malice, contempt, or even self-righteousness, we are secretly taking the side of the darkness while waving the banner of good. Simply by taking this side, we become a beacon of darkness for others, secretly luring them into 




But the truth is that we secretly *want* this, because the worse they get, the more we are "forced" to escalate our righteous wrath — the most delicious feeling of all. This behavior creates new evil — but we never admit this to ourselves. We tell ourselves that we are not creating *new* evil, but only exposing the evil already there.


---

Think back to a time when you skirted your own conscience — that is, acted against your own deepest values by convincing yourself that it was okay to do so. We've all done this, whether we know it or not. In that moment, part of you knew *perfectly well* that you were harming the world for your own benefit. Yet your mind concocted a clever story to act as a kind of smokescreen; a way to muddy the water so that you could plausibly deny any knowledge of what you really were up to — so that in a sense, even *you* didn't know. It is a bizarre schism of mind; one in which you simultaneously *know* and yet somehow *do not* — and it is responsible for *all the evil there ever was*. Our examples may differ in degree, but not in kind.

It's impossible to overstate just how much of human activity takes place from within this state of self-deception — or just how much harm it causes. Consciously, we may only have the best of intentions. Yet part of us secretly knows better. We know, *even as we're doing it,* that our behavior will darken the world; but because we've proven to ourselves that it will somehow be a "net good," we think it's safe to override this little voice. What does it know? Then, when our behavior inevitably *does* darken the world, the effects are usually so distant in time and space that we can plausibly deny any connection to it — at least, consciously. We then use the excuse of a darker world to justify even *more* self-deceptive behavior, telling ourselves that it's necessary to "fight evil." This is what we tell ourselves, but again, *part of us always knows.*


We recognize when other people are lost in this state — we call it "evil" — yet we never notice when we ourselves are. Perhaps the most striking example of this is when we mock and shame our political enemies.


It is impossible to know, in any given situation, whether your behavior will *actually* be a net benefit or harm to the world — and it is precisely this difficulty that the darkness exploits. We tell ourselves that all we have to do is to calculate a little more carefully, when actually our entire premise is built on quicksand.



When we encounter another person in this maddening state of self-deception, our first instinct is often to attack them for it. But here's what we can't see.

---
---



~~How many ventures have been started with the best of intentions, only to leave the world in a darker state? If you could peer into the minds of their originators, in nearly every case you would find that those "good intentions" were only skin-deep, failing to factor in a much broader vision of "goodness" that every one of us can sense deep down, if only we listened carefully enough.~~

Why is it so hard to defeat the evil in the world? What if nearly everything we're doing to "fight" it is secretly strengthening it?

People are only able to cause harm due to a kind of self-deception. Part of them knows _perfectly well_ that they are doing wrong, but this knowledge is carefully shielded from conscious self-reflection, so that it doesn't _feel_ wrong. All they consciously hear are their own clever justifications. It is a bizarre schism of mind; one in which they simultaneously _know_ and yet somehow _do not_. It is this shadowy mechanism that is responsible for _all the evil there ever was_.

We rightly abhor this state in others, but the truth is that every one of us knows it intimately well ourselves. 

The examples we're aware of are just the tip of the iceberg. The vast majority are hidden from our conscious minds, to preserve our self-image.

Every time any one of us engages in it, we induce the same tendency in everyone else.

Perhaps the most surprising example is this: any time we perceive others as *fundamentally morally defective* — or ourselves as *intrinsically superior* — we are engaged in profound self-deception. The deepest part of us can perceive our commonality with others, and recognizes that the "evil" in them lives within us too, but this recognition grates on us. So our mind shields this perception from us, so that we feel licensed to treat them with contempt.

Part of us knows that our contempt is only liable to make them dig in their heels and become worse people, but we secretly *want* this, because it makes us look better by comparison. If we knew we that were doing this, it would defeat the whole purpose, and so we hide it from ourselves *even harder*, until there is no trace of knowledge in our conscious minds. Yet our target can subconsciously sense that we're lost in the very self-deception that we're viciously judging *them* for — and this is precisely why it works.

By treating them with contempt, we are subconsciously telegraphing to them that *darkness is the way.* They perceive us as "evil" for precisely the same reason we see them that way, which makes them feel even less compunction for their misbehavior. And we are secretly *inducing* this perception in them, so that we can use it as proof that they are fundamentally defective, thus licensing escalation. After all, any decent person would have recognized our *good intentions.*

This is only one of an infinite number of ways that our darkness leaks out of our minds while convincing us that we are doing "good."

When we treat people with contempt, part of us knows that our behavior is only likely to shove them deeper into the abyss; to make them _worse_ people, and to thereby darken the world as a whole. But we convince ourselves that it is somehow "for the greater good." Our target can subconsciously sense our self-deception — the very thing that we're viciously judging _them_ for — and it makes them perceive us as evil for precisely the same reason we see them that way. This compels them to dig in their heels, which we then take as proof that we were right about them: after all, any decent person would have used this opportunity to repent, or at least self-reflect. But the truth is that something in us intentionally provoked this outcome, in order to preserve our own self-image as "good people."

Deep down, we know that a "good person" would never knowingly darken the world to bolster their own self-image, and so we must hide this knowledge from ourselves at any cost. Thus, we almost never realize that we're doing it. But ironically, the less we realize it, the more self-deceptive it is, and therefore the better it works. This is why contempt for our enemies is the surest sign that we are hiding something from ourselves — the very _opposite_ of what that sentiment seems to be telling us. It is nearly impossible to believe that simple _contempt_ for "bad people" makes the world darker — and this is exactly why it works.

If you want to know whether you're engaged in self-deception, you cannot simply listen to your thoughts. They will _always_ convince you otherwise. But there is a deeper part of you that _knows_. It is always available to us, if only we choose to look. The problem is that we rarely choose to look.

Humans are masters of self-deception. Nowhere is this more obvious than in our treatment of people who we consider enemies. We show them cruelty — if only mildly — telling ourselves that we are "teaching them a lesson" or "putting them in their place" or some such thing. You know the feeling — the one of self-righteous indignation. Part of us knows that this behavior will only make them _worse_ people: that they will see _us_ as evil and dig in their heels, convinced of their own righteousness. We secretly _want_ this, because it proves that they are the bad guys. This is what we are ultimately after, whether we know it or not. We _need_ other people to be the "bad guys" in order to keep hiding from our own self-deception — so we do everything in our power to ensure that they _stay_ the "bad guys," but do it in ways that appear noble on the surface.

Do we know that we are doing this? Yes and no. This is the hardest thing to describe. Part of us knows _perfectly well_ that this behavior is only increasing the "net darkness" in the world — but this knowledge is hidden behind an astonishing array of clever justifications, acting like a smokescreen — so that in another sense, we really do _not_ know. It is this bizarre schism of mind, in which we simultaneously _know_ and yet somehow _do not_, that is the secret behind _all the evil there ever was._

---

In fact, the conflation of "kind" with "nice" is a byproduct of our darkness; an excuse not to do the right thing when it becomes hard.

---
---

There is an aspect of our minds that clearly knows right from wrong. We tell ourselves that it's safe to override it, by substituting our own definition of "good" — after all, _we_ are the ones in charge here, and it has no authority. We think that if we just believe this strongly enough, that it will magically become true, and we will never have to confront this betrayal of our conscience. Every one of us does this, whether we know it or not. In fact, it is those of us who are least aware of it that are most engaged in it. The more we ignore our conscience, the quieter it gets, until we no longer even realize that we have one. It becomes the stuff of myth; a fairy tale with no hold on us — but part of us always secretly knows better.

See, it never actually goes anywhere; we just become increasingly skilled at overlooking it. Part of us knows _perfectly well_ that we are doing wrong — according to our own deepest standards — but we somehow shield this knowledge from conscious self-reflection. It's not that it becomes _unconscious_, per se: it's always perfectly accessible to our conscious minds, if only we choose to look. We just _choose not to look_. This results in a paradoxical state of mind; a bizarre schism, in which we simultaneously _know_ and yet somehow _do not_. It is this very state that has enabled _all the evil there ever was._ Every misbehavior, from the tiniest unkindness to the most horrific atrocity, ultimately rests on exactly the same principle — and every time any one of us engages in it, we lower the threshold for others to do the same. This is the secret trick by which evil spreads without anyone recognizing their own complicity.

We each believe we're fighting the evil out there by unleashing our own darkness in a controlled manner, but that's not what's actually happening. The reason we hate other people for being evil is not to help free them of it — or to help anyone else, either. Instead, something in us seizes upon this chance to shove them deeper _into_ the abyss; further into the very confusion that enables their misbehavior in the first place. Why? Because the more darkness that exists "out there," the easier it becomes to hide from it "in here." The darkness in our minds _needs_ us to darken the world, to remain hidden from our minds — but it must find a way to do so that comports with our self-identity. And since most of us self-identify as "good people," we can't just go around being cruel to innocent people or victims. No; we must be cruel to the _bad people._

This is why we mock, shame, and contemptuously judge our political enemies. We know that it will only make them dig in their heels, but we secretly want this, because it proves us right about them. After all, any decent human being would have seen that we were only _fighting evil_ and repented, or at least introspected. Their recalcitrance proves that they are indeed _fundamentally defective_ — and thus nothing we could have done would have helped. They are _beyond_ help. We're not creating _new_ evil; we're just exposing the evil already there. We're practically doing the world a _favor._ But something in us knows better. It's not that mocking or shaming are _inherently_ wrong — but we almost always infuse them with _contempt_; the sense that we are _intrinsically superior_, and thus justified in whatever we do. This secretly signals to our enemy that we're under the sway of the very self-deception that we're viciously judging _them_ for, which  makes them perceive _us_ as evil for precisely the same reason we see them that way, compelling them to fight back. This is on purpose. It is precisely by flashing them our inner darkness that we provoke them into behavior that we can use against them.

Why does our contempt signal that we're in the grip of self-deception? It's because the deepest part of us knows that we're not _fundamentally_ superior to anyone — and so any time we pretend to be, it is an unmistakable sign of self-deception operating. In this state, we _always_ use our superiority as an excuse to engage in _some_ kind of self-serving behavior that we do not recognize as such. Okay, but how do _they_ know this? It's because at the most fundamental level, their mind works in exactly the same way as ours — and both we and they know this. This is very difficult to describe. Part of us can always perceive the Light in others, no matter how well hidden. It also sees that they can see ours; and that they can
_see_ that we can see this, etc. This pattern, where we know something, and they know that we know, and we know that they know that we know, etc., is sometimes called

If we could recognize our enemy as a fellow human in the grip of a powerful self-deception — one that we ourselves are highly susceptible to — then we could never perpetrate this ruse. Our darkness therefore does something clever: it makes use perceive their evil as _intrinsic_ to their minds. In other words, we see them as _fundamentally_ defective people. 


---

It is nearly impossible to talk a person out of this state — or to even convince them that they're in it. This is increasingly true the deeper they are stuck. Beyond a certain point, we don't even bother trying: we simply perceive them as _evil_ and feel the need to viciously attack them for it. But this almost always backfires. They tend to dig in their heels, convinced that _we're_ the evil ones. This not only _decreases_ the chance that they will confront their self-deception, but generally _strengthens_ that capacity. Where did we go wrong? It's not merely that we were firm or even fierce. That is sometimes necessary. But the moment we saw them as _fundamentally defective_, something else took control of our minds. We felt the powerful urge to shove them deeper into the abyss, where they belong — but we found a way to dress this up as righteous. Our target could subconsciously sense that we were in the grip of the very self-deception that we were viciously judging _them for_. Of _course_ they couldn't tolerate it. They were perceiving _genuine darkness_ in us — which we _wanted_ them to see, precisely so that we could perpetrate this ruse.

You see, the deepest part of us knows that we are not _intrinsically_ superior to anyone — and so the only way we can feel _contempt_ for them is by shielding this knowledge from ourselves. In other words, it is _profound_ self-deception — and it signals to our target that we are caught in the very trap that we're viciously judging _them_ for, 

But if you look carefully enough into your mind while behaving this way — and this is _hard_ — you will discover that something in you secretly _intended_ this outcome. By treating them with contempt, you signaled to them that you're caught in the grip of the very delusion that you're viciously judging _them_ for, knowing that this would bait them into behavior that you could use against them. 

Why do we do this? Because the more evil we can make our enemies, the easier it becomes to hide our own self-deception from ourselves. This itself is an act of profound self-deception — and the one that our culture is least aware of.

We are shoving each other into the abyss in order to prove how righteous we are.

Your target subconsciously recognizes this, even if you consciously don't — and it is _this_ that convinces them to dig in their heels.

It's a fascinating process to watch; almost like we're trying to pull a fast one over reality. Part of us knows that this can never work, but that doesn't stop us from trying. ("Get away with it")

It's impossible to overstate just how much of our seemingly well-intentioned agendas are ultimately rooted in some kind of self-deception.

Humans have a nearly-unlimited capacity for self-deception. Every one of us engages in some kind of self-serving behavior that we do not recognize as such, and that we would immediately put an end to if forced to confront it. We may not realize that we do this, but it is those of us who are least aware of it that are most caught up in it. What allows it to continue is that knowledge of this behavior exists in a kind of limbo state. Part of us knows _perfectly well_ that we are doing wrong — according to our own deepest standards — but that knowledge is carefully shielded from conscious self-reflection, so that in another sense, we genuinely _do not_ know. All we hear are our own clever justifications. It is this paradoxical state — this bizarre schism of mind, in which we simultaneously _know_ and yet somehow _do not_ — that has enabled _all the evil there ever was._ Every misbehavior, from the tiniest unkindness to the most horrific atrocity ever committed, ultimately rests on exactly the same principle — and every time any one of us engages in it, we lower the threshold for others to do the same. This is the secret trick by which evil spreads without anyone recognizing their own complicity.

When we encounter another person in this state, we feel the urge to viciously attack them for it, as if to teach them a lesson. [...]

Why do we do this? Because the more we can reinforce the self-deception in others, the easier it becomes to overlook our own. It is a defense mechanism, shielding us from aspects of ourselves that we are not yet ready to confront. This is the _only_ reason we ever contemptuously judge others. It's not judgement itself that's wrong. If judgement simply means wise discernment, then _of course_ it is helpful. But the darkness in our mind seizes upon this opportunity to inject itself into our interaction, hoping that we won't notice — and usually, we don't. It can be an _incredibly_ subtle thing — but no matter how carefully we hide it, it _always_ ends up darkening the world. Again, part of us secretly knows this, but we have a powerful incentive to hide it from ourselves. This, in turn, makes others treat _us_ with contempt, which we do not tolerate for exactly the same reason that they couldn't tolerate ours. Round and round it goes, with each round opening up new avenues for self-deception. The more darkness we see "out there," the easier it becomes to perceive our own darkness as righteous.

We are not actually fighting our enemies; we only _think_ we are. In truth, we are secretly helping each other hide from our own darkness. But now consider this from the perspective of the darkness. It's almost as though it is using humanity as a vehicle to spread itself, by convincing us each that we are valiantly fighting it. This is something you can learn to perceive directly. Any time you feel malice, contempt, or self-righteousness toward anyone, you can actually _feel_ the darkness in your own mind reaching out toward theirs in a kind of "secret handshake." You and they may be enemies on the surface, but under the covers, all of our darkness is secretly allied. In fact, they are more than just allied. It is as though they are the very same entity; an intelligent, even _sentient_ entity, that knows exactly how to manipulate each of us toward its sinister ends. This is more than just a metaphor. There is but one darkness, distributed across all of our minds — and until you learn to evict it from your own, you can _only_ reinforce it in others, flawlessly convinced that you're fighting it. It is an _impossibly_ clever trap.

Why is there so much darkness in the world? How are people able to cause so much harm without apparent compunction? They do it by closing off their hearts; suppressing their humanity. It's as though a dark veil has been placed over their consciousness, shielding them from fully perceiving the _life_ in their victims — be they other people, animals, or nature herself. This enables them to cause harm without feeling the full impact of their behavior. Part of their mind knows _perfectly well_ that they are doing wrong, but this knowledge is carefully hidden from conscious self-reflection, so that it doesn't _feel_ wrong. All they hear are their own clever justifications. It is a bizarre schism of mind; a form of profound self-deception — and it has enabled _all the evil there ever was._

We hate other people for engaging in this state, but the truth is that every one of us is familiar with it ourselves. Think back to a time when you skirted your own conscience, pretending either that you couldn't hear it or that you didn't have to listen. We've all done this. Our examples may differ in degree, but not in kind. In this darkened state, we license ourselves to get away with self-serving behaviors that we would otherwise recognize as going against our own deepest values. You may be aware of having done this before, but the examples we can consciously recall are only the tip of the iceberg; only those that our subconscious allows us to see. In truth, we engage in this state _far_ more often than we realize.

We tell ourselves that the reason we hate this state in others is to _combat_ their darkness, but this is itself profound self-deception.

Why is it so hard to defeat the evil in the world? What if nearly everything we're doing to fight it is secretly strengthening it?

There is but one darkness in the world, and it is shared across all of our minds. We never notice it in ourselves, but easily recognize it in others — who we then feel compelled to viciously attack, convinced that we're righteously fighting it. But part of us secretly knows better. It knows that by being cruel, we will only make them dig in their heels, thereby darkening the world further. Isn't that how it usually goes? When we treat other people with malice, don't they tend to double down and fight back? We tell ourselves that this isn't our fault: they are _evil_, after all, so _of course_ they would behave this way when confronted with our overwhelming goodness.

But that's not what's actually happening. If you look carefully enough — and this is _hard_ — you will find that the darkness in your own mind is secretly telegraphing itself to them, to show them that you are under the sway of the very sickness that you are viciously judging _them_ for, so that they will perceive _you_ as evil for exactly the same reason you see them that way, thereby compelling them to fight back. The whole thing was orchestrated by the darkness in both of your minds. But from your perspective, you are acting righteously. You are actually feeling the malevolent urge to shove another being deeper into the abyss; further _into_ the very confusion that enables their misbehavior in the first place, by telling yourself that they deserve it. But how could anyone "deserve" to be pushed further into the arms of humanity's ultimate nemesis? To be clear: you don't do this because you're a _bad person_, but because the darkness is infinitely more clever than any of us can fathom. It knows how to manipulate each one of us into harboring it in a way that we feel convinced is necessary — in fact, that we never recognize as dark in the first place. That's the thing: evil never actually _feels_ evil.

Any time you feel the slightest trace of malice, contempt, or self-righteousness toward anyone for any reason; or perceive yourself as one of the precious few "good guys" valiantly fighting the hordes of evil, this is what is secretly happening — and it _always_ darkens the world, one way or another. Simply by perceiving other people as _fundamentally defective_, or seeing the darkness as _intrinsic_ to their minds — in short, _contempt_ — the rest is all but guaranteed. In this state, the darkness in your mind is acting like a powerful beacon, secretly inviting the darkness in others to join the fray. It is a kind of secret handshake between your darkness and theirs. You may be enemies on the surface, but under the covers, our darkness is always allied. Your allies will feel the violent urge to join your noble mission, while your enemies will feel compelled to fight back. Even bystanders will feel the dark desire to choose sides and attack _something._ This is how the darkness gains dominion over our world, with none of us recognizing our own complicity. We only recognize it when _other_ people do it.

I used to think that kindness meant being nice. It wasn't until a few mushroom trips, as well as significant experience with meditation, that I realized that this is a false equivalence — and a dangerous one, at that.

Have you ever skirted your conscience — done something that you told yourself was okay, even though part of you secretly knew better? It's okay to admit it. All of us have done this. In fact, it is those of us who are least aware of it that are most engaged in it. What I was shown was that I partake in such self-deception _far_ more often than I realize. The examples I'm aware of are just the tip of the iceberg; only the ones that my subconscious allows me to see, to protect my self-image as a "good person." In truth, my mind is _constantly_ searching for ways to gain an edge for myself, the world be damned. This goes directly against my deepest values — but it never _feels_ like this; it always feels like I'm behaving in a completely reasonable and righteous way. I never notice just how much of my reasoning is _motivated_ reasoning — even when I'm trying to notice exactly that.

I was shown that every time I lie to myself like this, I subtly darken the world as a whole. My willingness to overlook my own self-deception secretly invites others to do the same. This results in a kind of domino effect, which can circle the globe _far_ faster than I would have believed possible.

Yet I tell myself that my behavior is innocent and harmless — and that if I just believe this fervently enough, it will magically become true.

---

I like to believe that I'm reasoning from first principles, and accounting for all the evidence, but my reasoning is almost always _motivated_ reasoning.
