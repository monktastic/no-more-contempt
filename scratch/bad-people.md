~~Why do wise people urge compassion for evildoers? They're not just telling us to be *nice*—they're warning us about an insidious trap that has ensnared all of humanity. It is the reason some people believe in an *evil global conspiracy* running the world from the shadows. In a sense, such a thing really exists—and our world will not be healed until we bring it down. Until then, no amount of cleverness can save us.~~

What it is that enables corporations to desecrate nature in the name of profit and governments to wage unjust wars under false pretenses? How do murderers and rapists do what *they* do without compunction? Is it all explained by a handful of especially evil people—or is there something much more insidious and pervasive going on that we all unwittingly participate in?

---
---

Looking at the state of the world, one could be forgiven for believing that there's an _evil global conspiracy_ pulling the strings from behind the scenes. In a certain sense, there actually is.

It is the reason why, despite vast amounts of human ingenuity, many of our most pressing problems seem only to be getting worse—the collapse of our biosphere; degradation of our social fabric; intensification of the climate crisis; etc. All the cleverness in the world will not save us as long as it is being co-opted by a foe that we can scarcely comprehend—one that lives within our own minds.

What is it that enables "bad people" to cause harm without compunction? Something in their minds is shielding them from fully perceiving the *life* in their victims—be they other people, animals, or nature at large. It is a state of profound self-deception—one that we rightly abhor—but more than just hating the *state*, we tend to feel contempt for the people themselves. We see them as *fundamentally defective*—as though the evil were intrinsic to their very being. Check and see if that's true for you. Don't you feel not only superior to them, but *fundamentally* so?

The truth is that it's only possible to feel this way by engaging precisely the same shielding mechanism in yourself. To feel fundamentally superior to *anyone*, you must darken your mind in exactly the same way the "bad people" do—yet when *you* do it, it feels not only acceptable, but positively righteous, doesn't it? It seems insane to question whether contempt for bad people is healthy. Of *course* it is.

But something deep inside you knows this is a lie. It knows that contempt for other people only ever darkens the world—even if you can't say exactly *how.* And *because* you cannot say exactly how, you convince yourself that it won't; that yours is somehow different. But it doesn't feel like you're convincing yourself—it just feels like "the truth." Your target can sense this profound self-deception—even if you can't—and it makes them perceive *you* as evil for precisely the same reason you see *them* that way, which helps them feel more justified in their behavior. Part of you secretly intended this—but since you don't know that, you take their recalcitrance as proof that you were right about them, thus licensing you to escalate. _Voilà_—the world has been darkened.

Going forward, you will be less likely to notice the insidious presence of darkness in your own mind, as you grow increasingly obsessed with the "real threat" out there. You will justify more self-serving behaviors of your own without any awareness that you're doing so, because they will seem *irrefutably necessary*. The darkness has hijacked not only your perception—making others appear evil—but your *entire cognitive apparatus*, preventing you from even suspecting that you're being manipulated. You believe you are *helping.* It *needs* you to believe this.

Meanwhile, other people will notice your self-deception—if only subconsciously—and it will give them tacit permission to engage in their own; although of course they, too, will be unaware of doing so. In this way, the infection slowly spreads, without anyone being consciously aware of their own involvement. Nearly everyone harbors a subtle contempt for *someone*, believing it's there to help them *fight* evil; never realizing that all it really does is signal to the global network of evil that their own minds have been compromised and are ready to spread *more* darkness.

Evil rarely announces itself as such. It mostly looks like all the tiny white lies we tell ourselves to benefit ourselves at the world's expense, rationalizing that they're minor and irrelevant in the grand scheme of things—especially given how broken the world already is. But it is the accumulation of all these lies that allows the great evils of the world to sustain themselves, resulting in heart-wrenching atrocities that we feel absolutely no connection to, and whose "evil perpetrators" enable us to close down our hearts even further, in a horrifying feedback loop.

It is impossible to communicate just how subtle our contempt can be while still accomplishing its dark mission. Simply by *perceiving reality as an intrinsically lifeless collection of "stuff" over which humanity has dominion*, we unwittingly reinforce the systems that permit corporations to plunder nature for profit; factory farms to brutalize helpless creatures; prisons to dehumanize inmates in ways that guarantee recidivism; and governments to send our young off to wars whose only purpose is to line the pockets of the rich. All of this and more is the *inevitable result* of a broken worldview that blinds us to the infinite beauty of life, reducing it to mere stuff to be exploited—in other words, that encourages a subtle contempt for *reality as a whole*.

That is why, if you wish to be of genuine service in ending the madness; of bringing down the "evil global conspiracy"; your insight into the nature of evil must go all the way to the bottom. Anything less, and some part of you will always be working against you; reinforcing the very systems that you consciously decry.



---


It knows that the only reason anyone closes off their hearts in this way is to help them overlook their *own* harmful behavior. This is as true for you as it is for the "bad people." Therefore, simply by feeling contempt, you are not only telegraphing your own inner darkness—you are also indicating your willingness to overlook this darkness for your own benefit. This makes them perceive *you* as evil, which proves to you that they are indeed fundamentally defective, thus making it even harder for you to notice the darkness within yourself.

This is impossibly clever and worth repeating. The darkness in your mind is hiding itself from you—but by tricking you into feeling contempt, it is loudly announcing to others, who then treat *you* with contempt, which convinces you that they are evil, making you even less likely to notice its insidious presence within yourself. You will feel licensed to engage in more harmful and self-serving behavior that you will be unable to recognize as such.

What we think of as evil is more like a kind of mind-virus. [Don't jump straight into giving a model.] As such, it is not inherent to any mind, and can thus always be evicted. The problem is that we ourselves are infected, and it cleverly manipulates us into *reinforcing* it in others while flawlessly convinced that we're helping. The sum total of this confused activity results in people and systems that are effectively sociopathic. No amount of cleverness will save us—because that cleverness is quietly serving another master.

Think back to how it feels to mock, shame, and contemptuously judge your enemies—the "bad people." Doesn't it feel like you're *valiantly fighting evil*? For some reason this only makes them dig in their heels, convinced that *you* are evil—which in turn makes you more certain that you're right about them, thus provoking more contempt.

Why did they dig in their heels? We tell ourselves it's because they're *bad people*—so *of course* they would—but the truth is that *contempt is how we signal to others that we're under the sway of our own parasite, thereby inviting them to mistreat us in ways that we can then use as proof that they are evil, thus licensing us to escalate.* Or more precisely: contempt is how our parasite tricks us into executing this dance without any recognition of what we're actually doing.

As long as you see yourself as *intrinsically* superior to anyone—the "bad people" included—you will *necessarily* act out the wishes of humanity's ultimate nemesis, one way or another, without any conscious awareness that you're doing so. You will certainly *feel* like you're in charge—but only because it wants you to. It has hijacked your mind at such a fundamental level that you're unable to even countenance the fact that it has done so. You're certainly not going to realize it by *thinking* harder, because your entire cognitive apparatus has been co-opted to prevent this.

You can get a taste of this by thinking back to a time when you skirted your conscience—that is, behaved in a way that went against your own deepest values while pretending it was okay. Part of you knew *perfectly well* that you were doing wrong—that your behavior would somehow make life worse for *all* of us—but you convinced yourself that you *didn't* know this; that you *couldn't* know this. Something in you carefully hid that knowledge, overriding it with clever justifications.




---


It does this by hiding itself perfectly from our own minds—so that we don't realize we're infected—while making us perceive it as *intrinsic* to others, so that we see them as inherently evil. We don't recognize that they're under the sway of a parasite that we ourselves share. Just bring to mind whomever you believe to be "what's wrong with the world." Don't they seem *fundamentally* morally defective—totally unlike you, and worthy of only contempt? This is your virus at work.

The problem is that your contempt signals to them that you're caught in the grip of the very illness you're judging them for, helping them feel *more* justified in their behavior. This isn't an accident: your darkness is *telegraphing* itself to them specifically to provoke this response—but it's preventing you from realizing this, so you take their recalcitrance as proof that you were right about them, thus compelling you to escalate.

You will feel increasingly self-righteous, allowing you to engage in more self-serving behavior that you will be unable to recognize as such, since it will feel justified or even necessary. The darkness is burrowing deeper into your mind, making it harder to detect—while convincing you that exactly the opposite is happening.




Every one of us uses the darkness of the world to justify *some* kind of self-serving behavior that we don't recognize as such, because it always feels justified or even necessary. It's impossible to overstate just how much of human activity falls into this category.





[You *know* that genuinely wise people don't behave this way—and moreover, they know you know, and you know they know you know, etc. ]

This is why our enemies dig in their heels when we mock and shame them. It's not the mocking or shaming themselves that cause it, but the hidden malice with which we infuse them. Nobody can *prove* this malice exists—not even ourselves—and this is exactly why it works. There are no *objectively verifiable* markers of darkness, and yet it leaves its imprint all the same. If you try to prove whether your action was good or evil, you will only get lost in a thicket of analysis and end up proving whatever you want—or rather, what the *darkness* wants—because unbeknownst to you, it has hijacked your *entire cognitive apparatus*, including the thoughts you think are your own.

If you really want to know whether your behavior is good or evil, you must turn to a place that's deeper than thought; a place that can never be hijacked. There is a part of you that knows when you're lying to yourself. It sees how this will darken the world even when there's no objective evidence; even when no one is watching. Modern society fetishizes thinking and rationality precisely because they enable us to overlook this part, relegating it to the spiritual or mystical. Organized religion, on the other hand, instructs us to rely on an external authority for the same reason. Both give rise to a massive blind spot that allows our darkness to thrive.



[Good and evil *cannot* be formalized. Any attempt to do so is only your mind trying to squirm out of its responsibility to be deeply sensitive to what your present situation requires of you. Your ideologies can serve as guidelines, but nothing more.]

[Something about how the feeling it gives us is that we're "getting away" with something, but actually we're only feeding our true nemesis.]

This is why it's so easy to lie to ourselves about our true intentions. We act in ways that benefit ourselves at the world's expense, mostly without any awareness of doing so—because we're listening only to our *thoughts,* which are easily manipulated by the darkness. There is a deeper part of you that *knows the truth*—but you can only hear it by learning to look beyond the surface of your mind; in a place that modern society has taught us *never* to look.

Every time we skirt our conscience, we feel a little thrill—as though we're "pulling a fast one" over the world. But the joke is ultimately on us, because every such act only darkens our reality further—which on one hand, we get to use as justification for even *more* self-serving behavior, but on the other, inevitably dead-ends in a planet unfit for our survival.

[We like to believe that the things we do when nobody is watching don't matter; that our intentions are irrelevant. That they remain confined to our minds...]

[Something about the conspiracy and perceiving it as external to us, which IS the conspiracy. Or maybe all of that stuff is implicit and can be left out? My normal paragraph about the Devil / Ego.]

That is where humanity finds itself now. The vast majority of our "grand projects" have largely been exercises in self-deception; the inevitable result being that our biosphere is collapsing at an ever-accelerating rate. The latter is merely the outward manifestation of the former inner sickness. And further such projects can only compound the problem—unless they are firmly grounded in the aspect of mind that recognizes a truth of reality that we've been studiously avoiding.

We are all intimately connected in a way that transcends all attempts to describe it. We have relegated this truth to the "spiritual," where we can safely lock it away—because we know that if we opened that box, we would be forced to confront our own profound complicity in the world's ills. Every act of conscience-skirting and every unkindness we have ever perpetrated on *anyone* still remains "out there," waiting patiently for us to clean it up. The atrocities we see halfway across the globe are not disconnected from us, like we imagine; nor are they excuses to pump even *more* darkness in the world in the form of contempt for their perpetrators.

On the contrary, every bit of darkness we see in the world is an invitation for us to clean up the darkness in ourselves. This is completely counterintuitive, which is why it's so hard to figure out—but when we finally do, something astonishing happens. We begin to perceive the *reasons* that other people are unable to give up their own darkness; and rather than make the horrifying mistake of shoving them deeper into the abyss for it, we start to sense our role in pulling them *out* of it.

This is called compassion—and it has nothing to do with being *nice.* Nice means pleasant and agreeable, which are fine qualities in most everyday situations, but worse than useless in the face of evil. Genuine compassion can be fierce, or even violent if necessary—but crucially, it never confuses the parasite for the person, and this seemingly-subtle distinction makes *all the difference in the world.* Again, there is no way to prove this, but part of you already knows it. By remaining rooted in your integrity, you rob the other person's darkness of the excuse it would otherwise use to justify itself. It lies naked and exposed, forcing the person to confront it.

The deeper we go into this realization, the more our standard view of reality begins to fall apart—but not in a bad way. We discover our profound and surprising inseparability with others, and with the world itself. We see *why* we could never "pull a fast one" over the world: because ultimately, we *are* the world. Exploiting nature cannot possibly work, no matter how cleverly it is done, because we *are* nature. The only way we can exploit anything or anyone is by hiding knowledge of the truth from ourselves—and this act of hiding is *itself* what darkens our reality.

Deeper still, we see that the very perception of our world as a fundamentally lifeless collection of "stuff" is profoundly incompatible with the continued survival of Life. That perception only arises from our darkness; that aspect of ourselves that seeks clever ways to exploit things without compunction. It is **exactly** the same mechanism that enables the "evil people" to harm others without remorse. As long as we perceive reality itself as inert, there will *necessarily* be people who perceive other beings that way. They are but the logical culmination of a process operating in all of us.

At the ultimate level, we find that there *are* no "others." This is the hardest level to describe, being what spiritual traditions call "enlightenment." Reality itself is a radiant singularity, whose essential nature is something like infinite Love. Again, this is not something soft and mushy—or at least, not *only* those things. It is beyond all mental categories, and yet we recognize it as the ultimate source of our heroic capacity to defend Life and the innocent at any cost. That is what you most ultimately *are.*

Everything we perceive as external to ourselves is more like a holographic projection of our true nature; that which is beyond time and unnameable. We have somehow always known this—yet at some point, we seemingly forgot. This was not a point in time, but somehow the *creation* of time.

Humans are masters of self-deception. Governments and corporations lie through their teeth to justify harmful and self-serving agendas; dressing them up in sophisticated rationalizations to mask their true purpose. One result is that our biosphere is collapsing at an ever-accelerating rate, undermining the very basis of life. This collapse is but a mirror image of the subterfuge; merely the outward manifestation of an inner sickness.

Do the people in charge *know* they're causing this? Yes and no: part of them knows *perfectly well,* of course—but this knowledge is carefully shielded from conscious self-reflection, so that they can convincingly pretend *not* to know—even to themselves. All they consciously hear are their own clever justifications.

We think this problem is limited to the sociopaths, but this *itself* is profound self-deception. Every one of us has the capacity to lie to ourselves for our own benefit, and we employ it *far* more often than we realize. By its very nature, the vast majority of our own deception goes unnoticed by our conscious minds—but this doesn't mean it has no effect. On the contrary: it is the sum total of our individual deceptions that enables those larger systems to exist at all.

Do we know this? Yes and no. Part of us knows it *perfectly well*, but we hide this knowledge from ourselves, so that in another sense, we do *not*—or at least, we don't recognize the full depth of our own complicity. It is always someone else's fault; and the way we hide our own involvement is by feeling *contempt* for them—that is, the sense that they are *fundamentally defective* and completely unlike ourselves.

To be clear: people have vastly different degrees of complicity, and we are far from the worst. But it is only possible to feel contempt for *anyone* to the degree that we're still hiding something from *ourselves*. Therefore, simply by harboring it, we're revealing to them that we're in the grip of the very sickness we're viciously judging *them* for; making them see *us* as evil, thereby enabling them to feel even more justified in their misbehavior.

Again, do we know this? Yes and no. On one hand, their recalcitrance proves that they are, indeed, *fundamentally* defective—after all, any decent person would have repented, or at least introspected, in the face of such overwhelming good. On the other hand, something in you *knew* they would be unable to tolerate your contempt; that it would only make it *harder* for them to reflect—because the same is true of all of us. It is as though the darkness in your own mind telegraphed itself to them specifically to provoke theirs—or more accurately, to *recruit* it—for the two are secretly *allied.*

Indeed, all the darkness in the world is conspiring; together behaving like a *singular distributed malevolent entity*, manipulating all of humanity from beneath our conscious thresholds. The Christians call it the Devil, and the Buddhists know it as the Ego. It is the *primordial* evil conspiracy; the one to which all the rest owe their existence, and to which they ultimately filter up. Every attempt to destroy it without being free of it ourselves only ends up reinforcing it, because that confused impulse is only ever generated *by* it. It is an *impossibly* clever trap.

Nobody ever recognizes that they themselves are infected, but we eagerly seek it out in others, where we feel compelled to viciously attack it—never realizing that this is all being directed by the thing we claim to hate. It is not until we recognize just how cleverly it has seduced our own minds that we begin to appreciate how deeply the "bad people" are stuck, and what we can do about it.

The vast majority of evil doesn't feel remotely dark. It consists mostly of the tiny white lies we tell ourselves to justify self-serving behavior, and which we convince ourselves amount to nothing. But far from amounting to nothing, they weave themselves into the very fabric of our reality, steadily accumulating, eventually erupting in the form of *genuine atrocities* to which we feel absolutely no connection—and which invite us to feel even *more* contempt.

There is only *one* thing that actually fights the Beast, and that is compassion. But it has nothing to do with being *nice*. Genuine compassion is something **much** more profound. So much more, in fact, that it challenges our very understanding of the nature of reality.

---

It turns out that a mind that is totally free of self-deception seeks nothing more than to be of the utmost benefit to all of Life. This is what you *are* in your deepest being. It sounds like a cliche, but it is something you can discover for yourself.



---
---

There really *is* a kind of "evil global conspiracy" secretly running the world from the shadows—but it's not the one you may be thinking of. This world will not be healed until we defeat it. Until then, no amount of cleverness can save us.

---

Why do we mock and shame our enemies—the "bad people"? Part of us knows that they will only dig in their heels, thus making them *worse* people—but we secretly want this, because it makes us look better by comparison, helping us justify more of our own self-serving agendas.

This is the *only* purpose of contempt (for other people). But it can be nearly impossible to admit—and that is exactly why it works. We are not consciously aware of our own self-deception, but our target subconsciously is—which is why they dig in their heels. They recognize in us exactly the same principle that enables their *own* misbehavior, thus making them feel more justified.

Each of us knows *perfectly well* when we are doing wrong, but this knowledge is carefully shielded from conscious self-reflection, so that it doesn't *feel* wrong. This is the secret mechanism behind *all the evil there ever was,* from the tiniest act of unkindness to the most horrific atrocity ever committed—and every time any one of us engages in it, we secretly invite everyone else to do the same; which we then judge them for, in a never-ending cycle.

This is how the darkness keeps itself alive without anybody recognizing their own complicity. It tricks us into noticing it only in others, who we then feel compelled to viciously attack, somehow never noticing that the true source of this urge is humanity's ultimate nemesis.

It's not that mocking and shaming are inherently wrong. It is entirely possible to use them for good—but they nearly always serve as vehicles for the darkness to leak out of our minds and into the world. Crucially, nobody can *prove* whether any such thing has happened—and yet you always know from the inside.




There are countless other ways it does so, but they have nothing in common other than that we *secretly know that we're doing wrong.*

This is why it is nearly impossible to tell from the outside whether an act is good or evil—and also why it is impossible to even *formalize* those notions: no matter how carefully you try to pin down right and wrong, your darkness can *always* find loopholes to exploit while proving that it did no such thing.



The deepest part of me knows that even the worst person is merely acting from a profound confusion that I myself share—and that by pretending otherwise, I will only *reinforce* that pattern in the world at large.




---

Evil is a kind of mind-virus, and as such, it can be evicted from people's minds. The problem is that *we ourselves* are infected, and the last thing it wants is for us to evict it from others. So it tricks us into overlooking its presence in our own minds while eagerly seeking it out in everyone else. We perceive them as *fundamentally defective*—as though the evil were *intrinsic* to their minds—making us feel compelled to viciously attack it.

This is *contempt.* If you look carefully enough into your mind while feeling this way, you'll find that part of you secretly *knows* that you're not intrinsically superior to anyone—the "bad people" included—and that by pretending you are, you will only shove their minds deeper *into* the abyss. This isn't just malicious—it is *malevolent.* We hide this fact *exceptionally* well from our own minds, but our enemy can sense it, causing them to feel even *more* justified in their misbehavior.

What's happening is that the darkness in our own mind is *telegraphing* itself to theirs, in order to provoke it—or rather, *recruit* it.


Then, since you've hidden from yourself the fact that you're doing this, you will take their recalcitrance as proof that you were *right* about them—that they are, indeed, *fundamentally* defective. This creates *new evil* in the world while convincing you that you're merely exposing the evil already there. This justifies more pessimism about the world, thereby licensing you to expand the scope of your own self-serving agendas without any conscious awareness of doing so. Something within you is doing this *on purpose,* and it doesn't want to be exposed.

The reason our biosphere is collapsing at an ever-accelerating rate is indeed that governments, corporations, and their leaders are effectively sociopathic—but the truth is that this system simply could not exist without the vast majority of us studiously overlooking our own complicity. Every time any one of us skirts our conscience for *any* reason—which is far more often than we realize—our inner self-deception weaves itself into our outer reality, subtly darkening it, causing a feedback loop that encourages everyone to do it *more.*

The crucial insight is that, at the very deepest level, none of us actually wants to be doing this—the "evil people" included. But as long as you believe that it's only *you* (or "the good people") who wishes to be free of it, the darkness in your mind will inevitably justify that belief by find clever ways to darken the minds of others so that they appear fundamentally different.

This insight is called *compassion*—and it has nothing to do with being nice. It is simply about seeing just how cleverly the darkness has manipulated your own mind, thus giving you insight into how it is still controlling others. This is the *only* way to fight evil without unwittingly creating more.


It would in fact be dangerously naive to believe that "evil people" have any conscious awareness of whatever goodness lies buried deep within their minds, if it exists at all. But until you see just how cleverly the darkness has commandeered your *own* mind, you will be unable to

There really *is* an "evil global conspiracy" secretly running the world from behind the scenes—but it's not the one you may be thinking of.

Think back to a time when you mocked or shamed someone for being a "bad person." They probably just dug in their heels and saw *you* as a bad person in return. What may not be obvious is *why*.

Part of you *knew* they would dig in their heels—in fact, it *wanted* this, so that you could prove to yourself how much better a person you are. But if you knew you were doing this, it would defeat the whole purpose—so you hid that knowledge from yourself. But *hiding knowledge of your own wrongdoing* is the very essence of evil. It is the only way that anyone has ever been able to do wrong, from the tiniest act of unkindness to the most horrific atrocity ever committed.

Part of you *knows* this—that the only way the "bad people" can do wrong is because of a capacity for self-deception that you yourself share. But if you were consciously aware of this, it would bring down your carefully-constructed reality by shattering the scaffold of blame that secretly upholds it. So we hide this knowledge from ourselves *at all costs.* We *must* see other people as "evil"—that is, intrinsically defective, and thus fundamentally unlike ourselves.

The problem is, simply by feeling this way, you are subconsciously signaling to them that you're under the sway of the very sickness that you're viciously judging *them* for. This is *why* they dig in their heels: they are perceiving in you the very darkness you see in them. The world has become darker as a result, but you both walk away feeling even more justified. This is not an accident: the darkness in you secretly telegraphed itself to them specifically to engineer this outcome. It knew how theirs would respond—because the two are fundamentally identical.

This is very difficult to communicate. Your darkness and theirs aren't merely of the same *kind*, but are somehow the *very same thing.* All the darkness in the world together behaves like a *singular distributed malevolent entity*, manipulating all of humanity from beneath our conscious thresholds. The Christians know it as the Devil, and the Buddhists call it the Ego. It is the *primordial* evil conspiracy; the one to which all the rest owe their existence, and to which they ultimately filter up. Every attempt to destroy it without being free of it yourself only ends up reinforcing it, because that confused impulse is only ever generated *by* it.



This is why wise people urge compassion for evildoers. They are not telling us to be *nice.* It's just that the only other options are malice, contempt, or self-righteousness—and these can only ever increase the darkness in the world, because they are *made* of it. The deepest part of us *knows* this, but we hide this knowledge from ourselves in *precisely* the same way that the "bad people" hide knowledge of their own wrongdoing. Doing so helps us keep our own dark behavior hidden, so that we never have to confront it.




This is how the evil spreads without anyone recognizing their own complicity. It's not that mocking or shaming are inherently wrong. Wielded with wisdom, they may actually be used for good. But far more often, they serve as vehicles for our darkness to hitch a ride beneath our conscious thresholds.



There's a part of you that's *more than willing* to benefit yourself at the world's expense.


---

There really *is* a kind of evil global conspiracy running the world from behind the scenes—but it's not the one you may be thinking of.

Think back to a time when you skirted your conscience—that is, behaved in a way that went against your own deepest values but pretended it was okay. We've all done this, whether we realize it or not. In fact, it is those of us who realize it least that are engaged in it the most. That's because the more we do it, the less we recognize that voice as a *moral imperative.* It slowly becomes replaced with our *own* voice, until we can no longer tell the two apart.

We become increasingly convinced that we're the masters of our own destiny; that the harmful effects of our actions will magically evaporate if we just pretend hard enough. Over time, we lose the ability to even perceive that there *are* harmful effects—at least, consciously. But no matter how carefully we hide it, part of us always knows—and it will eventually be our undoing.

An "evil person" is simply one who has fallen so deeply into this trap that we no longer feel it is worth rescuing them from it—but the interesting part is *why* we feel that way. It is because the darkness in our *own* mind senses a perfect opportunity: by making us perceive them as *fundamentally different* from ourselves, it knows that we will feel licensed to treat them in a way that drives their self-deception deeper *into* their minds


and therefore completely unlike ourselves, we feel morally licensed to shove them deeper *into* the abyss where they seemingly belong—and we know that nobody can blame us for it.


This is why we hate our enemies. It is not to make the world a *better* place, but to make it a *worse* one—yet in a way that is hidden from our own conscious minds. By hating them, what we're really doing is showing them that the darkness in them lives within us, too—and that we're just as willing to overlook ours as they are. This makes them see *us* as evil for the same reason we see *them* that way, which makes them dig in their heels, forcing us to fight them even harder.

This whole sordid dance was secretly orchestrated by the darkness in *both* of our minds. Our own darkness telegraphed itself to them—because it recognized itself in their eyes, and therefore knew how they would respond. The result is that we both feel more justified in harboring our own darkness. Given how awful this world is, we have every right to harbor it.

This is how the darkness spreads without anyone recognizing their own complicity. We each justify our own special privileges, which subconsciously invites others to do the same, thus making the world darker, which we then use as justification for more of our own. But what "special privilege" did we give ourselves here? *The privilege to treat others with contempt for falling victim to their darkness*. 

After all, think about how you feel when you skirt your own conscience and someone tries to shame you for it. You *know* that they don't have your best interests at heart—in fact, they don't have *anyone's* best interests at he, no matter how hard they pretend otherwise. You *know* that they're only using your all-too-human failure to throw you under the bus for their own benefit—and there's no way in hell that you'd let them get away with it. We think it's somehow different when *we* do it—and that is exactly the "special privilege."

The darkness we see in the world is the cumulative result of all of us making the same basic error without awareness of what we're doing. The darkness is playing us for fools in order to gain dominion over our world, and we keep falling for it. Yes, it accumulates more in some minds than in others—which helps those people rise to positions of power—but to treat them as the *cause* of the mistake is to fall again into the same fundamental trap, thus tightening the noose.

You could say that the real conspiracy is the belief that the conspiracy lives *outside* of ourselves—for only by believing that can it trick us into doing its evil bidding. Once we believe that we are righteously battling the hordes of evil, we cannot help but feel contempt for those responsible; and that contempt, despite being seemingly private, *inevitably* weaves itself into the fabric of our reality, which further empowers those hordes of evil that we believe to be external.

It is only once we confront the full depth of our own complicity in this primordial conspiracy that we begin to comprehend just how deeply the "bad people" are stuck, and what our role is in ending it. The truth is that compassion is the *only* thing that actually fights evil—but until we have found our way out of the maze, it sounds like something weak and hopelessly naïve.

True compassion has *nothing* to do with being nice—even if that is how it manifests in most everyday scenarios.

Bring to mind whomever you believe to be "what's wrong with the world." Don't they seem *fundamentally morally defective?* Here's what's really going on.

What we think of as *evil* is a kind of mind-virus—but when it infects someone, it causes others to perceive them as *intrinsically* evil as opposed to being infected with a parasite. This way, we feel no duty to help evict it from them. But this trick only works to the degree that *we ourselves* are infected. A person whose mind is free from the parasite—such as a Jesus or Buddha—simply cannot be fooled in this way. Such a mind cannot harbor even a *trace* of malice, contempt, or self-righteousness, because it sees this trick for exactly what it is: a gambit to create *more* evil.

Every one of us knows this deep down, even if we pretend not to. Therefore, when we feel contempt, we are powerfully signaling to our enemies that we ourselves are infected

The darkness in the world persists for a very simple reason: we never recognize it operating in ourselves, but easily identify it in others. This causes us to perceive them as fundamentally different from ourselves, which makes us contemptuously judge them. We somehow never realize that this itself *is* the darkness operating, but they do—making them feel compelled to return the favor.

The surest sign that we are harboring evil is that we perceive ourselves to be *intrinsically* superior to others—in particular, the "evil people." As long as we're doing this, our own darkness will inevitably use theirs as justification for some kind of self-serving behavior of our own that we will not recognize as such, which will in turn serve as an excuse for others to do the same.

This is not just abstract philosophizing. If

Humans are masters of self-deception: we find clever ways to benefit ourselves at the world's expense, often without any conscious awareness of doing so. But most of all, we tell ourselves that this is something only *other* people do—or that they do so for fundamentally different reasons than we do. *We* do it because we have to; *they* do it because they're bad people.

This enables us to feel *contempt* for them—that sense of being *intrinsically superior*. How could we *not* feel superior to the murders, rapists, corrupt politicians, etc.? But this is the greatest self-deception of all. For deep down, we know that we're not *intrinsically* superior to anyone—the "bad people" included—yet we hide this knowledge so well from our conscious minds that we can convincingly pretend *not* to know, even to ourselves.

This ability—to hide knowledge of our shared humanity from ourselves—is *exactly* the trick that enables them to harm others in the first place. Therefore, our contempt only reveals to them that we're under the sway of *exactly* the darkness that we're viciously judging them for, thus making them feel *more* justified in their misbehavior, which licenses us to feel *even more contempt.*

This is not by accident. 



By mocking and shaming our enemies, the darkness in our mind is *telegraphing* itself to them specifically to provoke theirs. This is why they tend to dig in their heels: they are perceiving in us exactly the darkness we're contemptuously judging *them* for—but since we don't know that we're doing this, we take their recalcitrance as proof that we were right about them, forcing us to escalate. After all, any *decent* person would have used this opportunity to better themselves.

It's not the mocking or shaming that caused this outcome. Those *can* be used for good.




our minds continually search for clever ways to benefit ourselves at the world's expense, and then hide from us the fact that we're doing this. We think this is something only other people do—the *bad people*—but this itself is profound self-deception.

It causes us to feel *contempt* for those people—the sense that they are *fundamentally defective* and essentially unlike us. But it is only possible to feel contempt to the degree that we're still hiding some kind of misbehavior from ourselves—and so this sentiment causes our target to perceive *us* as evil, making them feel even more justified in *their* misbehavior.

This is why our enemies tend to dig in their heels when we mock and shame them. We tell ourselves that this is a sign that we were *right* about them—that they are indeed *fundamentally* defective. After all, any decent person would have repented—or at least introspected—in the face of such overwhelming goodness. But this is just another layer of self-deception.

If you look carefully enough at your mind while feeling contempt, you'll discover that something in you is *trying* to stop them from reflecting, because this will give you the evidence you need to prove that you've done no wrong. This creates *new* evil in the world, but makes you feel like you're merely exposing the evil already there—a clear service to humanity.

None of this would work without the help of the other person. By feeling contempt, the darkness in your own mind is reaching out to the darkness in theirs, as if to offer it a secret handshake. If they were free of it themselves—which they're obviously not—they would immediately recognize this gambit and decline it. But because they are themselves infected, they unwittingly accept.

This is just one of countless ways the darkness spreads beneath our conscious thresholds. Its whole trick is to prevent us from noticing it within ourselves while simultaneously encouraging us to seek it out in others, where we can't help but viciously attack it—not realizing that we're being cleverly manipulated by our true arch-nemesis.

More generally, we use the darkness "out there" to justify darkness of our own. Every one of us knows the experience of giving ourselves special privileges, reasoning that the

There is, in fact, an evil global conspiracy running the world from behind the scenes—but it's not the one you're thinking of.

Have you noticed how mocking and shaming your enemies tends to make them dig in their heels and see *you* as evil in return? It may feel like an unfortunate side effect of your otherwise-noble intentions, but the the truth is that part of you secretly *needs* this to happen. Why? Because the more enmity that exists is in the world, the easier it gets to hide the dark aspects of your own mind from yourself—and so the darkness in you finds clever ways to *increase* the animosity in ways that you're not consciously aware of. This is something that nearly *all* of us are doing.

It's not that mocking or shaming are *inherently* wrong. There may sometimes be ways to use them for good. But we almost always infuse them with *contempt*—that is, the feeling that our target is *intrinsically defective*—and by doing so, we ensure that more evil is created.

The astonishing thing is how well this works, and how well we hide it from ourselves. As far as we can tell, we're doing no such thing. We were only *fighting evil*—and how could that ever be wrong? But the truth is that part of us knew *perfectly well* what was happening—it's just that this knowledge was carefully shielded from conscious self-reflection, so that all we could hear were our own clever justifications.

This is the secret mechanism behind *all the evil there ever was,* from the tiniest act of unkindness to the most horrific atrocity ever committed. Our examples may differ in degree, but not in kind—and every time any one of us engages in it, we lower the threshold for everyone else to do the same. But the really curious part is how this works.

By feeling contempt for our enemies, the darkness in your mind is secretly telegraphing itself to them, effectively letting them know that we're under the sway of the very darkness that we're viciously judging *them* for. It is a kind of secret handshake between our darkness and theirs.

Astonishingly, it doesn't even require *being in their presence*. Any time we skirt our conscience for any reason—which happens *far* more often than we're willing to admit—we are expressing our contempt for humanity as a whole, and this darkness doesn't just evaporate. It gets woven into the very fabric of our reality, where it goes on to infect others.




---

Bring to mind whoever you believe is responsible for the problems of the world. Notice any *contempt* you may feel for them — the sense that they are *intrinsically defective* and thus completely unlike you. What happens when you treat them this way?

You probably realize this, but they're liable to just dig in their heels and see *you* as evil in return. What may be less obvious is that


---
---

All evil relies on essentially the same trick: part of the person's mind knows *perfectly well* that they are doing wrong, but this knowledge is carefully shielded from conscious self-reflection, so that it doesn't *feel* wrong.

It is a state of profound self-deception; one that we rightly abhor — but the truth is that every one of us knows it intimately well ourselves. We've each skirted our own conscience before, pretending either that we couldn't hear it or that we didn't have to listen. In that state, part of us knows *perfectly well* that we're doing wrong — but we hide this knowledge from ourselves, so that in another sense, we *don't* know. Our examples may differ in degree, but not in kind.

Should we blame or judge other people for engaging in it? This hinges on a very subtle point: if we judge them with *contempt* — that is, with the belief that we are *intrinsically* superior to them; that they are *fundamentally* defective — then we are engaged in self-deception ourselves. Our target will subconsciously notice this — even if we don't — and it will give them tacit permission to engage in *more.* But the deception doesn't end there.

Part of us *knows* this will happen — that treating our enemies with contempt invites them to become *worse* people — but we secretly *want* this. Something in us *wants* to be forced to unleash the full extent of our righteous wrath — the most delicious feeling of all. And the more that happens, the *less* likely we are to notice the self-deception operating in *us*.

This is the secret purpose of contempt: it is the darkness in our own mind hiding itself from us while amplifying itself "out there." It is an *impossibly* clever trick. 

If "judgement" simply means "wise discernment," then of course there is nothing wrong with it; and if "blame" means holding people accountable, then it is surely good. The same goes for outrage. But we almost always infuse these with *contempt* — and this is how the darkness spreads.

This is why wise people urge compassion for evildoers. It has nothing to do with being *nice.* It's just that when you clearly see what is going on in their minds, it is *impossible* to feel even a *trace* of malice, contempt, or self-righteousness — because you see that these are only the darkness in your *own* mind using theirs as an excuse. Contempt is *evil.*

This is exceptionally difficult to formalize — perhaps even impossible — and that is *exactly why it works*. Nobody can *prove* when we're acting from contempt — and so if they accuse us of it, we have a ready-made defense that prevents even *us* from recognizing what we are doing.

There's nothing quite as deliciously satisfying as violently punishing evil. Yet if you look deeply enough into your mind while feeling this way, you'll discover that something in you secretly knows it will only *increase* the "net darkness" in the world, thereby making it a worse place — exactly the opposite of your stated intent.

So do we stop? No. Instead, we carefully hide this knowledge from our conscious minds, so that in a very real sense, we *cease* to know. It's not that the knowledge is gone, exactly. It still exists in a kind of limbo state. To keep it hidden, our minds generate *incredibly* compelling stories of how our behavior will actually be a "net good." After all, violence sometimes *is* necessary — so who's to say that it's wrong in this particular case?

The problem is, we really *are* acting maliciously — and as hard as we try to hide this fact from our own minds, it still somehow gets through to our target. It makes them perceive *us* as evil, causing them to feel *more* justified in their behavior; thereby resulting in the darker world we feared.

Do we pause and recognize our own role in this? No — we sense a *new* opportunity. Since we've convinced ourselves that even *we* don't know about our malevolent intent, we reason that *they* couldn't possibly know — and so if they see us as evil, it can only be proof that we were *right* about them: they are *fundamentally defective*, and must be stopped at any cost. Soon, we will be forced to unleash the full extent of our righteous wrath — a burden we must carry as "good people."

This is how the darkness spreads. It manipulates human minds into doing its bidding while convincing us that we're valiantly fighting it. It's not that "bad people" don't know that they're doing wrong, per se. Part of them knows *perfectly well* — but this knowledge is carefully shielded from conscious self-reflection, so that it doesn't *feel* wrong. We see this and hate them for it — but this hatred is merely our *own* darkness resonating with theirs, in a bid to create more.




---

Is it wrong to be cruel to "evil people"?

Deep down, something in you knows that it will only increase the "net darkness" in the world, even if you don't know exactly *how*. But it's extremely easy to hide this knowledge from yourself, so that it genuinely feels like you *don't* know; that you *can't* know. That knowledge exists in a kind of limbo state: it is perfectly accessible to your conscious mind if you know how to look — but we choose not to look.

Why do we not look? Because if we *knew* we were creating more darkness in the world, we would be no better than those we judge — and would therefore have no leg to stand on. So we keep that knowledge carefully tucked away. We then tell ourselves that since even *we* don't know, no one else could either. If they accuse us of it, we have an airtight defense.

There's just one little problem: this self-deception is *itself* visible to others — though usually only subconsciously. It makes them see *us* as evil for precisely the same reason we see *them* that way. They are recognizing *genuine darkness* in us — the very thing we see in them.

This is how the darkness spreads. We never recognize it in ourselves but viciously attack it in others — which is a clear signal that we ourselves are infected, thus inviting them to cozy up to theirs. And there's more. Not only do we know that we're spreading darkness, but we know that this is the mechanism by which it happens. Embedded in our cruelty is a hidden signal that *ensures* that our message will come across. This is the hardest part to describe.

Getting that signal across doesn't require overt cruelty. Simply by perceiving ourselves as *intrinsically superior* to others, and therefore more deserving — of power, or wealth, or even of just the right to be cruel — we strengthen that same tendency in everyone else.



---

If there is, it's very hard to prove. After all, it's impossible to predict all the downstream effects of even the tiniest action. So if our cruelty produces *some* benefit — which it often does — then on what basis could anyone blame us for it?

It is precisely this difficulty that allows evil to remain alive and well in our world. The deepest part of us *knows* that it is wrong — that our cruelty somehow always *increases* the "net darkness" in the world — but the details of *how* that happens are obscured from our conscious minds, so that we can convincing pretend *not* to know.

It is exactly this same trick that enables the "bad people" to do what *they* do. Part of them knows *perfectly well* that they are doing wrong, but this knowledge is carefully shielded from conscious self-reflection, so that it doesn't *feel* wrong.





This is a state of profound self-deception — and it has enabled *all the evil there ever was*, from the tiniest act of unkindness to the greatest atrocity ever committed. Every time any one of us engages in it, we strengthen that same capacity in everyone else.




---
---

The reason it's so hard to vanquish evil in the world is that part of secretly *needs* it to exist, to serve as cover for our *own* hidden darkness. So this part of us does something exceptionally clever: it finds ways to create *more*, but in ways that appear outwardly righteous.

Consider how good it feels to mock and shame your enemies. It may feel like you're punishing their evil, but something in you knows that they're only liable to see *you* as evil in return, causing them to double down — which will in turn license you to escalate. You are creating *new* evil in the world, just so that you may have the dark pleasure of violently punishing it in the future.

It is impossible to overstate the cleverness with which we perpetrate this ruse. It doesn't even require overt cruelty. Simply by perceiving another person as *fundamentally defective* — that is, by seeing the darkness as *intrinsic* to their minds — we are secretly telegraphing the darkness in our *own* mind, in order to provoke theirs.

The more we do this, the easier it gets to justify self-serving agendas of our own that we will not recognize as such. This is its ultimate purpose.

Do we know that we're doing this? Yes and no. Part of us knows it perfectly well, but this knowledge is carefully shielded from conscious self-reflection, so that in another sense, we don't. It is precisely the same state of self-deception that enables the "bad people" to do what *they* do. It's not that they don't know that they're doing wrong, per se. Part of them knows *perfectly well* — but this knowledge is shielded in exactly the same way.

If you wish to defeat evil, you must vanquish this mind-state. But to the degree that you see it as *intrinsic* to other minds



---
---

What if nearly everything we're doing to "fight evil" is secretly just making it stronger?

Think back to a time when you skirted your conscience — that is, behaved in a way that went against your own deepest values, but pretended it was okay. We've all done this. In that state, part of our mind knows *perfectly well* that we're doing wrong, but that knowledge is carefully shielded from conscious self-reflection, so that it doesn't *feel* wrong. All we consciously hear are our own clever justifications.

It is this state that has enabled *all the evil there ever was*; from the tiniest act of unkindness to the most horrific atrocity ever committed — and every time any one of us engages in it, we lower the threshold for others to do the same.

Hating people for engaging in this self-deception makes it *harder* for them to confront it.

---


We've all done this, but the examples we're aware of are only the tip of the iceberg. The vast majority remain hidden from our conscious minds, to preserve our self-image as "good people."


It's not that "bad people" don't know when they're doing wrong, per se: part of them knows *perfectly well,* but this knowledge is carefully shielded from conscious self-reflection, so that it doesn't *feel* wrong.

Hating people for engaging in such self-deception only makes it *harder* for them to confront, thereby reinforcing it. We tell ourselves that this is because they are *fundamentally defective,* quite unlike us. But the truth is that something in us *wants* to drive the darkness deeper into their minds. Why? To prove ourselves right about the world. Our desperate need to look like "good people" is what produces the perverse incentive to create *bad* people.

This is nearly impossible to admit to ourselves — but the harder we hide it, the more we subconsciously communicate to our enemies that we're under the sway of the very mistake that we're viciously judging *them* for, which is *why* they dig in their heels.



it is only once we see *why* it is so hard that we finally begin to appreciate exactly what enables the "bad people" to do what *they* do. 



---
---

What if nearly everything we're doing to "fight evil" is secretly making it stronger?

Consider the "bad people" of the world — the murderers, the rapists, the child abusers; the greedy bankers, corrupt politicians, and all who support them. Do they *know* they're doing wrong? Yes and no. Part of them knows *perfectly well* — but this knowledge is carefully shielded from conscious self-reflection, so that it doesn't *feel* wrong. All they consciously hear are their own clever justifications.

It is a state of profound self-deception; one that we rightly abhor — but the truth is that every one of us knows it intimately well ourselves. We have all skirted our conscience before, pretending either that we couldn't hear it or that we didn't have to listen. This is the secret mechanism behind *all the evil there ever was*. Our examples may differ in degree, but not in kind. Moreover, the examples we're aware of are just the tip of the iceberg; the vast majority remain hidden from our conscious minds, to maintain our self-image as "good people."

If you introspect carefully enough while hating "bad people" — and this is *hard* — you'll discover that something in you secretly wants to shove them deeper into the abyss, so that you can prove yourself right about them. This is a fundamentally malicious attitude wrapped in righteous garb, so it alerts your enemy to the fact that you're in the grip of the very delusion that you're viciously judging *them* for. They therefore double down, thus proving you right.

What actually happened is that the darkness in your own mind *telegraphed* itself to them, thereby provoking theirs — or you could say, *recruiting* it. You may be enemies on the surface, but under the covers, all of our darkness is secretly allied.

---



Astonishingly, this process doesn't even require *hatred,* per se. Simply by feeling contempt — the mere feeling that others are *fundamentally defective*, or that you are *intrinsically superior* — the darkness in your mind is powerfully telegraphing itself to the world, inviting them into the same darkened state.




The crucial insight is that this intention is not truly unconscious. It is perfectly accessible to consciousness, if only we choose to look. The problem is that we *choose not to look*.



---
---


Hating people for this behavior tends to drive that pattern deeper *into* their minds. Do we know this? Yes and no. Part of us knows *perfectly well* that mocking, shaming, and contemptuously judging our enemies will only make them dig in their heels — but we dress it up as righteous, so that their recalcitrance becomes proof that we were *right* about them; thereby helping us justify more of our own self-deception. This is the *only* reason we ever feel contempt for other people: to help us hide our own darkness from ourselves.

This is also the mechanism by which it spreads. Although we do not recognize that we're in its sinister grip, our enemies subconsciously do, which is *why* they dig in their heels. They are perceiving in us the very thing that we are viciously judging them for. This is not an accident. The darkness in us is *telegraphing* itself to them specifically to provoke theirs — or perhaps more accurately, to *recruit* it.

All the darkness in the world is secretly allied; behaving more like a *singular malevolent distributed entity*. The Christians know it as the Devil, and the Buddhists call it the ego. It is why some suspect the existence of an evil global conspiracy running the world from behind the scenes. It is the *primordial* evil conspiracy; the one to which all the rest owe their existence, and to which they ultimately filter up. The reason we seem unable to defeat it is that we're each secretly protecting our own tiny sliver, convinced that ours is somehow different.

As long as we divide the world into the *fundamentally* good and bad people; those who deserve our compassion and those who deserve our contempt, we are still under its sinister sway. The *only* purpose of that distinction is to provide us with people for whom contempt is

makes us divide the world into *fundamentally* good and bad people; those who deserve our compassion and those who deserve our contempt. This way, we feel sure that we're fighting for "team good" even when we're doing nothing of the sort. Compassion doesn't mean being nice or tolerating evil. It only means being acutely aware of our *own* capacity for darkness, and refusing to fall for it. It is the only orientation that does not create *more* evil.






This is how the darkness spreads, without anyone ever noticing their own complicity. We each find clever ways to justify our own; never recognizing it for what it really is. Any time we close off our hearts or withhold our love from the world, we are empowering the very thing we claim to be fighting. It is not until we see just how cleverly the darkness has commandeered our own minds that we begin to appreciate exactly what enables the "bad people" to do what *they* do — and learn to be of service in ending it.




why evicting it from our own minds is the only way to ensure that we don't continue to unwittingly reinforce the problem.

Their minds are blocking them from fully perceiving the *life* in their victims — be they other people, animals, or nature at large. We recognize this state as *evil*, but the truth is that every one of us knows it intimately well ourselves.

There can be moments in life — such as during near-death experiences, or on psychedelic trips, or in deep meditation — where we are confronted with the full depths of our own self-deception. We discover that there have been countless times in our lives where we lied to ourselves about our true intentions, causing tremendous harm that we couldn't see — or could we? This is very hard to describe.

I was shown all the times I mocked, shamed, or even just contemptuously judged my enemies; convinced that it was for the greater good. I was then shown how part of me knew *even as I was doing it* that this would only further darken the world. The harder I tried to wriggle out of this realization, the more fiercely I was confronted with it; being shown the exact location in my consciousness where this knowledge had resided. Holy shit — it was indeed there all along.

I saw that to feel genuine contempt for another person, I had to darken my mind in *precisely* the same way that the "bad people" do. I was shown how I could always see the Light buried beneath the darkness in other people's mind, and how it was quietly calling out. Yet I knowingly chose to *smother* it — knowing fully well that nobody could blame me for this. I was only *fighting evil,* after all — and how could that ever be wrong? It was the *perfect crime.*

*Contempt is evil*. It exists *only* to darken the world.



This is how the darkness spreads. It convinces each of us that it exists only "out there" — and that to fight it, we must close off our hearts. But far from *fighting* evil, it recruits more. I am loudly telegraphing to the world that I'm under the sway of the very illness I claim to be fighting.

People are only able to cause harm due to a peculiar kind of self-deception: their minds are blocking them from fully perceiving the *life* in their victims — be they other people, animals, or Nature at large. Part of their mind knows *perfectly well* that they're doing wrong, but this knowledge is cleverly shielded from conscious self-reflection, so that it doesn't *feel* wrong. All they hear are their own clever justifications.

We tend to hate people for such behavior, seeing them as evil — as though the "badness" is somehow *intrinsic* to their minds. We thus feel licensed to treat them with contempt — apparently unaware that this only drives the darkness deeper *into* their minds. But the truth is that part of us knows this *perfectly well*. We *know* that mocking and shaming our enemies only makes them dig in their heels — but we convince ourselves that it will somehow benefit the world.

If you can understand the lie your mind tells you that makes it okay to feel contempt for "bad people," you will understand *exactly* the mechanism that makes them feel okay harming others — because it is *precisely* the same.



We're under the sway of *precisely* the same self-deception they are. Seeing another person as *fundamentally defective* or yourself as *intrinsically superior* requires that you darken your mind in exactly the same way that they do — and you don't notice this for exactly the same reason that they don't: you are secretly benefiting from it. But how?




---
---

Humans are astonishingly good at hiding dark agendas behind pretty-sounding words. Not necessarily *evil* agendas, but ways of benefiting themselves at the world's expense. The harm caused by such subterfuge is often not visible until far too late. How can we identify when people are doing this, so that we stop falling for it? Better yet, how do we stop them from doing it?

First, notice how it feels like some people do this *on purpose.* They know *perfectly well* that they are doing wrong, but choose to do it anyway. It probably feels like such people are *fundamentally* unlike yourself: they are *intrinsically* morally defective, whereas you are a "good person."

What happens when you treat a person this way — that is, with *contempt*? Have you noticed how they tend to just dig in their heels, convinced that *you're* the evil one? They feel *more* justified in  — and less guilty for — whatever storyline is driving their behavior, which in turn reinforces your perception of them as *intrinsically* defective.

Here's what you might not see: part of you not only *knew* this would happen, but secretly *intended* it. The only reason we ever feel contempt for another person is to *reinforce* their darkness, so that we can more easily hide our own darkness from ourselves. There are aspects of ourselves that we are not yet willing to see, and we keep them hidden by shoving others deeper into the abyss. But because we are "good people," the only way we can safely do this is by perpetrating it on the "bad people."

It can be nearly impossible to admit that we're doing this — but it is not until we see *why* it is so hard that we begin to appreciate exactly what prevents the "bad people" from confronting what *they* are doing, thereby giving us the crucial insight necessary to end it. Until then, it is only possible to *strengthen* their darkness, even as we're flawlessly convinced that we're helping.

It's not that "bad people" don't know that they're doing wrong, per se. Part of them knows *perfectly well* — but this knowledge is carefully shielded from conscious self-reflection, so that it doesn't *feel* wrong. All they hear are their own clever justifications. It is *exactly* this same state that enables us to feel malice, contempt, or self-righteousness toward them.

The way it works is *impossibly* clever. Simply by feeling contempt, we're signaling to them that we're under the sway of the very self-deception that we're contemptuously judging them for. In other words, our darkness is *telegraphing* itself to them — like a secret handshake. We and they may be bitter enemies on the surface, but under the covers, our darkness is secretly allied.

In fact, all the darkness in the world together behaves like a *singular distributed malevolent entity,* manipulating all of humanity from beneath our conscious thresholds. The Christians know it as the Devil, and the Buddhists call it the ego. It is why some suspect the existence of an evil global conspiracy. It is the *primordial* evil conspiracy; the one to which all the rest owe their existence, and to which they ultimately filter up. What makes it so hard to defeat it is that each of us is protecting the aspect within our own minds, not recognizing it for what it is.

The darkness is a parasite — and like any parasite, it can be evicted. But first you must locate it. Find that part of you that wants to divide the world into the *fundamentally* good and bad people; those who deserve your compassion and those who deserve your contempt. That line exists *only* as a way for your darkness to keep its foot in the door, ready to spring into action.

There's a part of you that *knows* that the only way that people can do wrong is by employing this mechanism that you yourself are highly susceptible to. The more you clean it up in yourself, the more this truth becomes consciously available to you — not as an idea, but as a direct perception. The more this happens, the more skill you gain in untangling the knots in their minds that enable it.

 A mind that is free of self-deception simply cannot *feel* malice, contempt, or self-righteousness, no matter the circumstances, because it sees where these inevitably lead.

This is an exceptionally hard thing to admit — and it is only by seeing *why* it's so hard to admit that we begin to appreciate what is happening in *their* minds. Only then do we learn how to end it.

Pause and reflect on how it feels to mock and shame your political enemies. It probably feels *righteous* — but a deep part of you knows that they are only liable to dig in their heels. That part of you secretly *wants*

We think that hating "bad people" is a sign of the good within us, but it's actually a sign of something *much darker.*

People are only able to cause harm due to a kind of self-deception: their mind is shielding them from fully perceiving the *life* in their victims — be they other people, animals, or nature at large. Part of them knows *perfectly well* that they're doing wrong, but this knowledge is carefully hidden from conscious self-reflection, so that in another sense, they really *don't* know. All they consciously hear are their own clever justifications. It is this bizarre schism of mind — in which people simultaneously *know* and yet *don't* — that is responsible for *all the evil there ever was*.

It is precisely this same mechanism that enables us to hate *other* people for engaging in it. Part of us can see the sense in which we are fundamentally the same as them, but we hide this knowledge from ourselves, so that we feel intrinsically superior. We then license ourselves to treat them with contempt, despite knowing fully well that that this will only drive the darkness deeper *into* their minds. We tell ourselves pretty stories about all the good it will accomplish, and how it will be a net positive for the world — but part of us secretly knows better.

We are caught in precisely the same self-deceptive trap that we viciously judge our enemies for — and they can sense this, if only subconsciously. In fact, this is *how* it drives the darkness deeper into their minds. The darkness in our own mind is telegraphing itself to them, reminding them of who — or what — is truly in charge of this world. The existence of genuine Light feels increasingly like a myth. This is how the darkness slowly gains dominion over our reality.

Every time any one of us is unkind to anyone for any reason, or skirts our conscience in any other way, we reinforce this same tendency in everyone else. As the world becomes darker, the darkness in our own minds finds increasingly clever ways to justify itself to us, often in the name of "fighting evil."

We think that hating "bad people" is a sign of the good within us, but it's actually a sign of something *much darker.*

People are only able to cause harm thanks to a kind of self-deception: part of them knows *perfectly well* that they're doing wrong, but this knowledge is carefully shielded from conscious self-reflection, so that it doesn't *feel* wrong. All they hear are their own clever justifications.

They thus seem fundamentally morally defective — quite unlike us. Sure, we sometimes make mistakes, but deep down at least we mean well. It is our duty as good people to remind the bad people of this important difference by showing them our contempt.

Alas, this just makes them dig in their heels —  but what did we expect? After all, they are _bad._ Any decent person would have repented and apologized in the face of such overwhelming _good_. Now we are forced to escalate our righteous wrath. The burden we willingly bear as good people.

Of course, we don't see that a dark part of us _wanted_ this outcome. How could we? That part is **very** carefully hidden from our consciousness. 

It knows that people don't ultimately want to be self-deceptive, even though it looks to all the world (and sometimes even themselves) like they do. But it also knows that very few people consciously recognize this. This provides it with an opportunity to commit the perfect crime.

Instead of helping _free_ them from the abyss, it can shove them further in and get away with it. This way, they will end up looking like _worse_ people, making us look all the better by comparison. But it can't do this in an overt way, because that would be too obviously evil. So it finds a clever hack.

It telegraphs our dark intent in some small, almost imperceptible way — perhaps with a simple dehumanizing glare. This gives us plausible deniability, but their darkness immediately recognizes the telltale sign of malevolence, triggering their "bad person" detector. As a cherry on top, we are pretending that this behavior is noble, making us appear hypocritical as well. This is like a gift-wrapped present to their darkness: it puts their mind at ease knowing that the people they're harming so richly deserve it.

If, instead, you had held fast to your integrity and _not_ devolved into contempt, your accusation might have actually landed somewhere helpful. It would force them to self-reflect, if only imperceptibly. Their darkness would not find a trace of the "hook" it needs in your mind to prove to itself that you are just like them. Instead, it is confronted with a blinding light. This _necessarily_ weakens their self-deception: it _reduces_ the evil in the world.
