 A mind that is free of self-deception simply cannot *feel* malice, contempt, or self-righteousness, no matter the circumstances, because it sees where these inevitably lead.

This is an exceptionally hard thing to admit — and it is only by seeing *why* it's so hard to admit that we begin to appreciate what is happening in *their* minds. Only then do we learn how to end it.

Pause and reflect on how it feels to mock and shame your political enemies. It probably feels *righteous* — but a deep part of you knows that they are only liable to dig in their heels. That part of you secretly *wants*

We think that hating "bad people" is a sign of the good within us, but it's actually a sign of something *much darker.*

People are only able to cause harm due to a kind of self-deception: their mind is shielding them from fully perceiving the *life* in their victims — be they other people, animals, or nature at large. Part of them knows *perfectly well* that they're doing wrong, but this knowledge is carefully hidden from conscious self-reflection, so that in another sense, they really *don't* know. All they consciously hear are their own clever justifications. It is this bizarre schism of mind — in which people simultaneously *know* and yet *don't* — that is responsible for *all the evil there ever was*.

It is precisely this same mechanism that enables us to hate *other* people for engaging in it. Part of us can see the sense in which we are fundamentally the same as them, but we hide this knowledge from ourselves, so that we feel intrinsically superior. We then license ourselves to treat them with contempt, despite knowing fully well that that this will only drive the darkness deeper *into* their minds. We tell ourselves pretty stories about all the good it will accomplish, and how it will be a net positive for the world — but part of us secretly knows better.

We are caught in precisely the same self-deceptive trap that we viciously judge our enemies for — and they can sense this, if only subconsciously. In fact, this is *how* it drives the darkness deeper into their minds. The darkness in our own mind is telegraphing itself to them, reminding them of who — or what — is truly in charge of this world. The existence of genuine Light feels increasingly like a myth. This is how the darkness slowly gains dominion over our reality.

Every time any one of us is unkind to anyone for any reason, or skirts our conscience in any other way, we reinforce this same tendency in everyone else. As the world becomes darker, the darkness in our own minds finds increasingly clever ways to justify itself to us, often in the name of "fighting evil."

"Bad people" are only able to do what they do because of self-deception: part of them knows perfectly well that what they're doing is wrong, but the full implications of their behavior are carefully hidden from conscious self-reflection. Instead, they just hear their own justifications.

They thus seem fundamentally morally defective — quite unlike us. Sure, we sometimes make mistakes, but deep down at least we mean well. It is our duty as good people to remind the bad people of this important difference by showing them our contempt.

Alas, this just makes them dig in their heels —  but what did we expect? After all, they are _bad._ Any decent person would have repented and apologized in the face of such overwhelming _good_. Now we are forced to escalate our righteous wrath. The burden we willingly bear as good people.

Of course, we don't see that a dark part of us _wanted_ this outcome. How could we? That part is **very** carefully hidden from our consciousness. 

It knows that people don't ultimately want to be self-deceptive, even though it looks to all the world (and sometimes even themselves) like they do. But it also knows that very few people consciously recognize this. This provides it with an opportunity to commit the perfect crime.

Instead of helping _free_ them from the abyss, it can shove them further in and get away with it. This way, they will end up looking like _worse_ people, making us look all the better by comparison. But it can't do this in an overt way, because that would be too obviously evil. So it finds a clever hack.

It telegraphs our dark intent in some small, almost imperceptible way — perhaps with a simple dehumanizing glare. This gives us plausible deniability, but their darkness immediately recognizes the telltale sign of malevolence, triggering their "bad person" detector. As a cherry on top, we are pretending that this behavior is noble, making us appear hypocritical as well. This is like a gift-wrapped present to their darkness: it puts their mind at ease knowing that the people they're harming so richly deserve it.

If, instead, you had held fast to your integrity and _not_ devolved into contempt, your accusation might have actually landed somewhere helpful. It would force them to self-reflect, if only imperceptibly. Their darkness would not find a trace of the "hook" it needs in your mind to prove to itself that you are just like them. Instead, it is confronted with a blinding light. This _necessarily_ weakens their self-deception: it _reduces_ the evil in the world.
