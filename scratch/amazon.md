These men are embedded in a complex and grotesque system much larger than themselves — one that we ourselves are intimately linked to — and while they must be held accountable, we sense the error in pinning the blame squarely on them. We feel no desire to be *cruel*, because we see clearly how cruelty just perpetuates the fundamental mistake.

The second is to feel *malice* or *contempt* for these men, or the urge to violently punish them. They seem somehow *fundamentally* different from us, the "good people" — and if we could just expunge the world of such people, the rest of us would live happily ever after.
