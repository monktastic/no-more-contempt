We think that hating "bad people" is a sign of the good within us, but it's actually a sign of something _much darker_. All the hostility we've leaked into the world still lives out there somewhere, where we can judge it from afar, blissfully unaware of our own connection to it. But part of us always knows — and we cannot have the more beautiful world we desire until we acknowledge this and clean it up.

---

People are only able to misbehave due to a kind of self-deception: part of them knows perfectly well that they are doing wrong, but that knowledge is very cleverly shielded from conscious self-reflection. This is the secret mechanism that has enabled _all the evil there ever was_ — and it has enabled our own misbehavior, if we're honest. We have all skirted our conscience before, pretending either that we couldn't hear it or that we didn't have to listen.

When we encounter a person in this state, we don't recognize a fellow human under the sway of a powerful illusion; one that we ourselves are all-too-susceptible to. No, we see them as _fundamentally morally defective_; completely unlike us. Such a person cannot be helped; they can only be subdued or punished — and it is our valiant duty to do so. This is what we tell ourselves, but it is a sinister lie.

When you treat people this way — with _contempt_ — you are secretly telegraphing a particular darkness through your eyes. It is as though you are hinting at what you are capable of if really pushed. But the darkness in their mind now recognizes itself in you. This triggers their "evil" detector, which makes them feel even more justified in their behavior; _reinforces_ their self-deception. This in turn convinces you that you were right about them, which licenses escalation.

This is how the darkness drives us toward Armageddon while convincing us that we're helping. It is an _insanely_ clever trap.

You are darkening the world while pretending not to know. But this would make you a hypocrite, so you push this knowledge out of mind. But no matter how well you hide it, part of them can see that you know — and part of _you_ can see that they see it. So you push it out of consciousness even harder, convincing yourself that you're not doing anything wrong. Soon you're not just pretending: you "really" don't know — which is exactly what you're judging them for in the first place.

Your mind has the perfect cover story: contempt isn't evil, especially when it is directed at "bad people." In fact, anyone who says otherwise is probably evil themselves. But contempt is secretly designed to _elicit_ evil — and anything that provokes more evil can surely be called evil, especially when it pretends to be good. This is how your darkness masquerades as the Light. You get to blame it on others, even though it came from you.

If you self-identify as a "good person" — which almost all of us do — there is one more trick that it has: it makes a big show of being extra sweet and "compassionate" to the people who deserve it, so that neither we nor anybody else can question which side we're really on.

The more you uncover this whole ruse, the more you find that the _opposite_ is true: dividing the world into "good people" and "bad people"; those who deserve your contempt and those who deserve your compassion, is an unmistakable sign of the darkness operating. Our mere intention to divide the world in this way is precisely what keeps that division alive. It is _empowering_ the "bad people" to do what they do while feeling justified in it.

[//]: # (The darkness in their mind triggered yours, knowing fully well that you would return the favor — which you dutifully did. Your darkness and theirs are _coordinating._)

It would take someone of considerable skill and patience to show you the full extent of your own complicity without triggering your defenses — and you're not even close to being the worst offender. If someone were to try to force you to see it with _contempt,_ they would only end up reinforcing it — which, remember, they secretly want, though they "don't know" this.

The more trapped in self-deception a person is, the more skill it takes to pop them out — but also the more plausible deniability we have if we choose instead to shove them deeper in, because the more "fundamentally defective" they appear. There is no "deeper in" for such a person to go, so we couldn't possibly be doing anything wrong. The worst people are therefore the perfect lighting rods for our darkness; the places where we cause the most harm, and yet where we least suspect it.

It is a fiendishly clever trap. The more darkness there is in a society, the more susceptible we are to reinforcing it, flawlessly convinced that we're helping. Eventually the whole population is on a hair trigger, seeing darkness at every turn, lashing out to "defeat" it, not realizing what we're doing.

As you might have guessed, that is where our society finds itself now. So what are we to do?

The "trick" (if you can call it that) is to recognize the darkness for what it is: an absence masquerading as a presence.

Its ultimate nature is that of an absence. The absence of what? Of a particular kind of self-awareness. As such, it cannot be defeated by more absence. MLK said it best:

> *Darkness cannot drive out darkness; only light can do that. Hate cannot drive out hate; only love can do that.*

And yet, make no mistake, it very convincingly _behaves_ like a presence. The darkness in your mind is _collaborating_ with mine. When I see yours, it reliably triggers mine, and I return the favor. It is a kind of secret handshake; one that I always have the choice of accepting or rejecting. I signal my acceptance simply by agreeing to feel _contempt_; by pretending to be _intrinsically superior._

Think of the darkness as that devil on your shoulders. It is extrinsic to your mind; a kind of parasite. But it doesn't just whisper obviously-bad ideas in your ear; it alters your very perception. It makes you see _their_ devil as intrinsic, so that contempt feels natural. Theirs is doing the same.

In fact, our devils aren't just coordinating. If you look carefully, you'll see that they actually behave more like limbs of a single distributed malevolent entity: _the Devil_, if you will. It is that "evil global conspiracy" that some people fear exists: a covert entity responsible for all the world's ills, that hides itself so perfectly that nobody even suspects its existence, let alone that it lives _in their own minds_. They cannot even see it when it is clearly and explicitly pointed out. It is _that_ good.

It is said that the elites are playing us off each other to take attention off of them, but the Devil is playing a _much_ bigger game — one in which even the elites are merely pawns. Every one of us is leaking our darkness into the world, where it accumulates in centers that we then identify as the sociopaths. (Visualize this as a multi-generational game to make more sense.) They then become the lighting rods for _even more darkness,_ thus keeping the whole sordid game going.

The only way to win the fight against the Darkness is to relinquish your own. You have every right be to be angry and outraged by what is happening — but if they are _self-righteous_ anger and _contemptuous_ outrage, then they aren't what they seem.

It is only by recognizing yourself in others that you begin to see what you must do to pull them out, and thereby rid the world of this curse. This is true kindness, and it has nothing to do with being *nice*. It can be fierce or even violent if necessary, but malice, contempt, and self-righteousness are impossible. Again, not because you want to be _nice,_ but because you now see that those sentiments are secretly designed to _trap the world in darkness_.

This is why your intentions matter far more than you can possibly know. When you are acting from your inner Light, others can sense it (if only subconsciously), and it has a powerful ripple effect. The same is true of your darkness. And most crucially, your darkness is _astonishingly clever_ at masquerading as your Light. If you feel even the slightest trace of malice, contempt, or self-righteousness, it is _always_ your darkness pretending to be the Light.

All the hostility we pour into the world still lives out there somewhere, where we judge it from afar.


The darkness never stays confined to your own mind; it always finds a way to leak out, one way or another. Every drop of hostility that has thus found its way into the world still lives on, somewhere. It now appears to reside in other people's minds, but it never truly left yours. You are still tethered to it. Your subconscious continually guides you back there, so that you may heal it. But we usually misunderstand, interpreting it as an invitation to dish out more. It is the ultimate tragedy.


Your true enemy is never other people, but the darkness that has captured all of our minds. Its most powerful trick is to make you see it as intrinsic to some people's minds but not others — most notably, not your own or your allies'. This makes you violently lash out, not realizing that you are doing its dark bidding.

It is said that "the road to hell is paved with good intentions," but only because we often deceive ourselves about our true intentions.

Every act of unkindness that you've ever perpetrated

This is how the darkness masquerades as the Light.

If you look carefully enough, you'll find that contempt for "bad people" is secretly designed to make them _worse_; to _reinforce_ their capacity for self-deception. Whether or not you have a valid point about their behavior, your contempt will only trigger their defense mechanisms. This is on purpose: if you can get them to dig in their heels, you can "prove" that they really _are_ fundamentally bad, which will justify your contempt — and license escalation. A few more rounds of this, and you'll get what you're really after: an unmistakably evil foe who you will be forced to violently defeat. This is the most delicious feeling in the world.

But you will never let yourself know that you're doing this. Your mind will carefully construct a flawlessly convincing story about how you were simply "fighting evil." You have _no idea_ how insanely clever your subconscious is at intentionally pressing people's buttons while pretending not to be. If you were to suddenly become aware of all the times in life that you've done this, it would cause a meltdown of your ego.

Exactly the same mechanism lives within our very own minds, though we rarely recognize it. It is what allows us to mock our political opponents with glee. We tell ourselves that they deserve it, and that it is making the world a better place — and we _believe_ this with all our hearts. Well, not really _all_ our hearts. The very deepest part of us always knows better, but we carefully shield this knowledge from conscious self-reflection. Sound familiar?

It's easy to get lost in speculation about whether such behavior is actually a net harm or good, especially because we don't get to see all of its downstream effects. But even if we do see the second-, third-, etc. order effects — like a humiliated father venting his frustration on his children, who then grow up to become "bad people" themselves — we never make the connection back to our own behavior. And even if by some miracle we do, we easily avoid recognizing our complicity. Sure, we may have provoked him, but he should have handled it with grace. Why didn't he just become a _better person_, like we so clearly intended?

Instead of getting lost in such speculation, there's something else you can do. If you inspect your mind carefully enough during such speculation, you'll discover that such contemptuous behavior only exists to hide something that your subconscious mind is secretly doing.

You see, part of us actually _wants_ "bad people" to become worse. Why? Because this enables us to feel like _better people_ by comparison; to reinforce our worldview of who's good and who's bad. But this is extremely hard to admit to ourselves. So our mind finds _exceedingly_ clever ways to push the "bad people" further into the dark in ways that we can label "righteous." When executed well — which is most of the time — you will never even suspect that you're doing this. The very idea will sound offensively absurd. And if anyone tries to point it out, powerful defense mechanisms will kick in, making it even harder to see — especially if they do it with even a trace of contempt.

The truth is that any time you are unkind; any time you feel contempt, malice, or self-righteousness toward _anyone_ for _any reason_; it is your ego operating, attempting to elevate or otherwise enrich yourself at the world's expense. It is _precisely_ the same mechanism that allows the "bad people" to do what they do — and when you give in to yours, you are reinforcing their tendency to do the same. **And this isn't an unfortunate side effect of your otherwise-noble intentions; it is in fact the _whole point_.**

To put it more simply: we don't hate bad people to make the world a better place; we hate them to make ourselves feel (and look) good _by making it worse_. In fact, we don't even have to feel hatred. Simply seeing a person as irredeemable is already an unmistakable sign that this terrible process is underway in your subconscious.

I realize this is a hard thing to accept, and that you're unlikely to believe me unless you've seen it clearly yourself. But I swear it is the truth — and it is something that you can discover firsthand yourself.

Seeing the full extent of it is what the Buddhists call _enlightenment._ You discover a shocking sense in which _you are everyone and everything._ The very deepest aspect of your mind is pure compassion, as is that of everyone else. But they've forgotten this, just as you yourself had for innumerable lifetimes. The very last thing you could ever want to do is continue to push them _further_ from realizing it — which is the inevitable result of perceiving them as fundamentally separate from yourself; of forsaking them.

This is not some bleeding heart idea. Kindness does not mean being nice, or sweet, or tolerant, or understanding. It simply means seeing the nature of reality clearly, so that your behavior inspires others to remember the astonishing truth instead of pushing them away from it. Such behavior may be fierce or even violent; it may look nothing like conventional "kindness" on the surface. But the very deepest part of you always knows the difference.

All of the darkness in the world is intimately connected — and part of it lives within your very own mind. By keeping your portion alive, you ensure that it continues to flourish "out there." That is why everything comes down to knowing ourselves deeply, and healing that secret part of us. Only by doing so can we become aware of our complicity in having reinforced the very conditions we decry, and begin to develop the capacity to take them apart.

This allows us to feel superior, in a way that can plausibly be defended as righteous. We are only _fighting evil,_ after all.

We maintain a dividing line between the "fundamentally" good and bad; those who deserve our compassion and those who deserve our contempt. That boundary changes throughout life, as we develop increasing empathy. But the maintenance of _any division at all_ indicates that our "devil" still has its foot in the door. The line exists only to justify its continued presence.

The short answer to "why show evildoers compassion?" is that the only alternative is to be evil.
