Contempt for other people is inherently self-deceptive. The deepest part of you knows that you are not _intrinsically_ better than anyone — and that by pretending you are, you will only trigger their self-deceptive tendencies, thereby reinforcing them. This will make them appear _more_ evil, thus vindicating your perception of them, and compelling you to escalate. Your darkness _provoked_ theirs, but it feels convincingly like their fault; like you were only "fighting evil."

This is why "bad people" dig in their heels when we're nasty to them: a dark part of us is _trying_ to elicit that response, to provide more effective cover for our own self-deception. It's not our being _mean_ that caused this; it was the self-deception with which we did it — deception that we weren't even conscious of. **The distinction between kindness and unkindness isn't about how _nice_ you are: it is about how much deception is present.**

The overt evil we see in the world is only the tip of the iceberg when it comes to human darkness. The vast majority is much more subtle, manifesting in the way we shame and mock our political enemies; the revenge fantasy films that reinforce our contempt; the hidden ways we license ourselves to take "a little extra" because other people are. The great evils simply could not exist without the support of this continual undercurrent. **It is this dark activity that secretly runs the world from behind the scenes.**

From a certain perspective, this shadowy activity appears sentient; even intelligent. The darkness in all our minds is _coordinating_; each provoking the other while carefully hiding itself from us, its hosts. In fact, they aren't truly separate: they behave more like appendages of a _distributed malevolent entity_, cleverly manipulating all of humanity from within the dark crevices of our own minds; the places where we dare not look. It is what some cultures know as the _Devil_ — and it is as "real" as anything you can touch.

In more modern terms, it is the _evil global conspiracy_ — that secret cabal responsible for all the world's ills, yet whose membership remains forever elusive. It is the _primordial_ evil conspiracy; the one to which all the rest owe their existence, and to which they ultimately filter up. To believe that you have uncovered it "out there" is to have fallen into its most basic trap: to keep our attention perpetually fixated outward so that we will never discover its true origin "in here" — the one place we can actually destroy it.

The elites may well be playing us off one another to take our attention away from them, but the Devil is playing a _much_ bigger game — one in which even the elites are merely pawns. It tricks us into hating them specifically so that we will empower it. Our self-righteous outrage may change the details of _who_ is in power, but never _what_ is in power — because that sentiment only ever originates from it. _Constructive_ outrage feels radically different. It comes from a different source, and has a different effect.

In the absence of malice, contempt, and self-righteousness, even behaviors like mocking and shaming can produce good. That's because they originate from the Light in your mind, instead of the darkness. People can sense your subconscious intent, even when you think they can't — and, in the case of darkness, even when you yourself cannot. It has a powerful effect on their minds, which ripples into the world. Thus, two behaviors that look nearly identical can have profoundly different long-term effects.

Your darkness can indeed suppress other people's misbehavior — at least, in public, and for a time. It is therefore easy to convince yourself that it "works." But if you look closely enough, you can always find the fingerprints of your own darkness imprinted on events distant in time and space; events that you would normally feel absolutely no connection to, let alone complicity in. All the darkness we have leaked into the world still remains, patiently waiting for us to clean it up.

Compassion results from the deep recognition of how deeply you yourself have been caught in the web of darkness. You see that it was never truly unconscious: part of you _always knew_ that you were in on it, even as you convincingly pretended otherwise. If you — the "good person" — could not recognize how badly you were trapped, how much the less could you expect it of the "bad people?" This evokes the powerful urge to _free_ them from it, whatever it takes — be it gentle or fierce.

Deep down, every one of us knows that this is how it works; that we always have a choice between powerfully shining our Light or cravenly hiding behind its dark twin; and that our choice has cosmic significance. But we have also made a secret pact with each other; that I will help you hide from your darkness if you help me hide from mine. We can reverse this. I promise to be equal parts fierce and kind so that your shadows may be safely brought to the Light, and I open the door of my heart so that you may do the same for me.

---

The ultimate truth is that you _are_ everyone and everything, in a profound and surprising sense. Realizing this fully is called _enlightenment_ (en-Light-enment), but all of us can sense it at all times, to one degree or another. All self-deception — and therefore all evil — ultimately boils down to ignorance of this truth. Our greatest purpose is to serve as reminders for each other, each through our own unique expression, whether it be wrathful or soft. The only other option is to veil it, by forsaking one another.

May we each find the grace to bring our own shadows to Light, so that we may offer this greatest of gifts to one another.

🙏🏽

When you treat people this way — with _contempt_ — you are secretly telegraphing your own darkness, as if to subdue theirs. But the darkness in their mind now recognizes itself in you. This triggers their "evil" detector, which makes them feel even more justified in their behavior; _reinforces_ their self-deception. This in turn convinces you that you were right about them, which licenses escalation.

This is how the darkness drives us toward Armageddon while convincing us that we're helping. It is an _insanely_ clever trap.

You are darkening the world while pretending not to know. But this would make you a hypocrite, so you push this knowledge out of mind. But no matter how well you hide it, part of them can see that you know — and part of _you_ can see that they see it. So you push it out of consciousness even harder, convincing yourself that you're not doing anything wrong. Soon you're not just pretending: you "really" don't know — which is exactly what you're judging them for in the first place.

Your mind has the perfect cover story: contempt isn't evil, especially when it is directed at "bad people." In fact, anyone who says otherwise is probably evil themselves. But contempt is secretly designed to _elicit_ evil — and anything that provokes more evil can surely be called evil, especially when it pretends to be good. This is how your darkness masquerades as the Light. You get to blame it on others, even though it came from you.

If you self-identify as a "good person" — which almost all of us do — there is one more trick that it has: it makes a big show of being extra sweet and "compassionate" to the people who deserve it, so that neither we nor anybody else can question which side we're really on.

The more you uncover this whole ruse, the more you find that the _opposite_ is true: dividing the world into "good people" and "bad people"; those who deserve your contempt and those who deserve your compassion, is an unmistakable sign of the darkness operating. Our mere intention to divide the world in this way is precisely what keeps that division alive. It is _empowering_ the "bad people" to do what they do while feeling justified in it.

[//]: # (The darkness in their mind triggered yours, knowing fully well that you would return the favor — which you dutifully did. Your darkness and theirs are _coordinating._)

It would take someone of considerable skill and patience to show you the full extent of your own complicity without triggering your defenses — and you're not even close to being the worst offender. If someone were to try to force you to see it with _contempt,_ they would only end up reinforcing it — which, remember, they secretly want, though they "don't know" this.

The more trapped in self-deception a person is, the more skill it takes to pop them out — but also the more plausible deniability we have if we choose instead to shove them deeper in, because the more "fundamentally defective" they appear. There is no "deeper in" for such a person to go, so we couldn't possibly be doing anything wrong. The worst people are therefore the perfect lighting rods for our darkness; the places where we cause the most harm, and yet where we least suspect it.

It is a fiendishly clever trap. The more darkness there is in a society, the more susceptible we are to reinforcing it, flawlessly convinced that we're helping. Eventually the whole population is on a hair trigger, seeing darkness at every turn, lashing out to "defeat" it, not realizing what we're doing.

As you might have guessed, that is where our society finds itself now. So what are we to do?

The "trick" (if you can call it that) is to recognize the darkness for what it is: an absence masquerading as a presence.

Its ultimate nature is that of an absence. The absence of what? Of a particular kind of self-awareness. As such, it cannot be defeated by more absence. MLK said it best:

> *Darkness cannot drive out darkness; only light can do that. Hate cannot drive out hate; only love can do that.*

And yet, make no mistake, it very convincingly _behaves_ like a presence. The darkness in your mind is _collaborating_ with mine. When I see yours, it reliably triggers mine, and I return the favor. It is a kind of secret handshake; one that I always have the choice of accepting or rejecting. I signal my acceptance simply by agreeing to feel _contempt_; by pretending to be _intrinsically superior._

Think of the darkness as that devil on your shoulders. It is extrinsic to your mind; a kind of parasite. But it doesn't just whisper obviously-bad ideas in your ear; it alters your very perception. It makes you see _their_ devil as intrinsic, so that contempt feels natural. Theirs is doing the same.

In fact, our devils aren't just coordinating. If you look carefully, you'll see that they actually behave more like limbs of a single distributed malevolent entity: _the Devil_, if you will. It is that "evil global conspiracy" that some people fear exists: a covert entity responsible for all the world's ills, that hides itself so perfectly that nobody even suspects its existence, let alone that it lives _in their own minds_. They cannot even see it when it is clearly and explicitly pointed out. It is _that_ good.

It is said that the elites are playing us off each other to take attention off of them, but the Devil is playing a _much_ bigger game — one in which even the elites are merely pawns. Every one of us is leaking our darkness into the world, where it accumulates in centers that we then identify as the sociopaths. (Visualize this as a multi-generational game to make more sense.) They then become the lighting rods for _even more darkness,_ thus keeping the whole sordid game going.

The only way to win the fight against the Darkness is to relinquish your own. You have every right be to be angry and outraged by what is happening — but if they are _self-righteous_ anger and _contemptuous_ outrage, then they aren't what they seem.

It is only by recognizing yourself in others that you begin to see what you must do to pull them out, and thereby rid the world of this curse. This is true kindness, and it has nothing to do with being *nice*. It can be fierce or even violent if necessary, but malice, contempt, and self-righteousness are impossible. Again, not because you want to be _nice,_ but because you now see that those sentiments are secretly designed to _trap the world in darkness_.

This is why your intentions matter far more than you can possibly know. When you are acting from your inner Light, others can sense it (if only subconsciously), and it has a powerful ripple effect. The same is true of your darkness. And most crucially, your darkness is _astonishingly clever_ at masquerading as your Light. If you feel even the slightest trace of malice, contempt, or self-righteousness, it is _always_ your darkness pretending to be the Light.

All the hostility we pour into the world still lives out there somewhere, where we judge it from afar.


The darkness never stays confined to your own mind; it always finds a way to leak out, one way or another. Every drop of hostility that has thus found its way into the world still lives on, somewhere. It now appears to reside in other people's minds, but it never truly left yours. You are still tethered to it. Your subconscious continually guides you back there, so that you may heal it. But we usually misunderstand, interpreting it as an invitation to dish out more. It is the ultimate tragedy.


Your true enemy is never other people, but the darkness that has captured all of our minds. Its most powerful trick is to make you see it as intrinsic to some people's minds but not others — most notably, not your own or your allies'. This makes you violently lash out, not realizing that you are doing its dark bidding.

It is said that "the road to hell is paved with good intentions," but only because we often deceive ourselves about our true intentions.

Every act of unkindness that you've ever perpetrated

This is how the darkness masquerades as the Light.

If you look carefully enough, you'll find that contempt for "bad people" is secretly designed to make them _worse_; to _reinforce_ their capacity for self-deception. Whether or not you have a valid point about their behavior, your contempt will only trigger their defense mechanisms. This is on purpose: if you can get them to dig in their heels, you can "prove" that they really _are_ fundamentally bad, which will justify your contempt — and license escalation. A few more rounds of this, and you'll get what you're really after: an unmistakably evil foe who you will be forced to violently defeat. This is the most delicious feeling in the world.

But you will never let yourself know that you're doing this. Your mind will carefully construct a flawlessly convincing story about how you were simply "fighting evil." You have _no idea_ how insanely clever your subconscious is at intentionally pressing people's buttons while pretending not to be. If you were to suddenly become aware of all the times in life that you've done this, it would cause a meltdown of your ego.

Exactly the same mechanism lives within our very own minds, though we rarely recognize it. It is what allows us to mock our political opponents with glee. We tell ourselves that they deserve it, and that it is making the world a better place — and we _believe_ this with all our hearts. Well, not really _all_ our hearts. The very deepest part of us always knows better, but we carefully shield this knowledge from conscious self-reflection. Sound familiar?

It's easy to get lost in speculation about whether such behavior is actually a net harm or good, especially because we don't get to see all of its downstream effects. But even if we do see the second-, third-, etc. order effects — like a humiliated father venting his frustration on his children, who then grow up to become "bad people" themselves — we never make the connection back to our own behavior. And even if by some miracle we do, we easily avoid recognizing our complicity. Sure, we may have provoked him, but he should have handled it with grace. Why didn't he just become a _better person_, like we so clearly intended?

Instead of getting lost in such speculation, there's something else you can do. If you inspect your mind carefully enough during such speculation, you'll discover that such contemptuous behavior only exists to hide something that your subconscious mind is secretly doing.

You see, part of us actually _wants_ "bad people" to become worse. Why? Because this enables us to feel like _better people_ by comparison; to reinforce our worldview of who's good and who's bad. But this is extremely hard to admit to ourselves. So our mind finds _exceedingly_ clever ways to push the "bad people" further into the dark in ways that we can label "righteous." When executed well — which is most of the time — you will never even suspect that you're doing this. The very idea will sound offensively absurd. And if anyone tries to point it out, powerful defense mechanisms will kick in, making it even harder to see — especially if they do it with even a trace of contempt.

The truth is that any time you are unkind; any time you feel contempt, malice, or self-righteousness toward _anyone_ for _any reason_; it is your ego operating, attempting to elevate or otherwise enrich yourself at the world's expense. It is _precisely_ the same mechanism that allows the "bad people" to do what they do — and when you give in to yours, you are reinforcing their tendency to do the same. **And this isn't an unfortunate side effect of your otherwise-noble intentions; it is in fact the _whole point_.**

To put it more simply: we don't hate bad people to make the world a better place; we hate them to make ourselves feel (and look) good _by making it worse_. In fact, we don't even have to feel hatred. Simply seeing a person as irredeemable is already an unmistakable sign that this terrible process is underway in your subconscious.

I realize this is a hard thing to accept, and that you're unlikely to believe me unless you've seen it clearly yourself. But I swear it is the truth — and it is something that you can discover firsthand yourself.

Seeing the full extent of it is what the Buddhists call _enlightenment._ You discover a shocking sense in which _you are everyone and everything._ The very deepest aspect of your mind is pure compassion, as is that of everyone else. But they've forgotten this, just as you yourself had for innumerable lifetimes. The very last thing you could ever want to do is continue to push them _further_ from realizing it — which is the inevitable result of perceiving them as fundamentally separate from yourself; of forsaking them.

This is not some bleeding heart idea. Kindness does not mean being nice, or sweet, or tolerant, or understanding. It simply means seeing the nature of reality clearly, so that your behavior inspires others to remember the astonishing truth instead of pushing them away from it. Such behavior may be fierce or even violent; it may look nothing like conventional "kindness" on the surface. But the very deepest part of you always knows the difference.

All of the darkness in the world is intimately connected — and part of it lives within your very own mind. By keeping your portion alive, you ensure that it continues to flourish "out there." That is why everything comes down to knowing ourselves deeply, and healing that secret part of us. Only by doing so can we become aware of our complicity in having reinforced the very conditions we decry, and begin to develop the capacity to take them apart.

This allows us to feel superior, in a way that can plausibly be defended as righteous. We are only _fighting evil,_ after all.

We maintain a dividing line between the "fundamentally" good and bad; those who deserve our compassion and those who deserve our contempt. That boundary changes throughout life, as we develop increasing empathy. But the maintenance of _any division at all_ indicates that our "devil" still has its foot in the door. The line exists only to justify its continued presence.

The short answer to "why show evildoers compassion?" is that the only alternative is to be evil.
