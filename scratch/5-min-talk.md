Every one of us has skirted our conscience before, pretending either that we couldn't hear it or that we didn't have to listen. In that state, part of us knows _perfectly well_ that we're doing wrong, but that knowledge is very carefully shielded from conscious self-reflection. All we hear are our own clever justifications.

It is this very state that has enabled _all the evil there ever was_. Deep down, we know that even the "bad people" are ultimately only acting from self-deception, but we carefully hide this fact from ourselves, telling ourselves that they are fundamentally defective. That way, we feel justified behaving in ways that are secretly designed to trigger their defense mechanisms, thereby strengthening their self-deception, making them look _more_ evil. We do this to hide our own darkness from ourselves.

In truth, there is no "our" darkness and "theirs." The darkness in all of our minds is secretly allied, behaving like a singular distributed malevolent entity. It is this entity that you are looking at when you see "evil" in another person's eyes. If you feel contempt or malice for them, what you are really feeling is the Darkness commandeering your mind. Any action you take from this place will darken the world, in a way that makes you feel profoundly righteous.

This is why some people suspect the existence of an evil global conspiracy. It is the _primordial_ evil conspiracy; the one to which all the rest ultimately owe their existence, and to which they all filter up. Make no mistake: there are real, concrete conspiracies, run by people who knowingly harbor the darkness. But their existence depends on the rest of us
