I saw that the real reason I mock and shame my enemies is not to help them — or anyone else — see the light, but to nudge them *toward* the very darkness that I claim to oppose. The worse they became as people, the more reassured I would feel of my own place in the world; that I was one of the precious few "good guys," valiantly fighting the hordes of evil — a phenomenon that lived only outside myself.

I discovered that I didn't even need overt cruelty to accomplish this goal: simply by harboring *contempt* — that seemingly-innocuous feeling of being *intrinsically superior* to others — I could push people toward the abyss. This is difficult to describe. I saw that contempt is the darkness in my own mind flashing itself to others in order to provoke them into perceiving *me* as evil, so that they would feel compelled to fight back — which I could then use as evidence that I was right about them. After all, I am *not* evil — and if they think so, it only proves how *bad* they are.

I didn't even need to display my contempt directly to my enemy. Simply by feeling it in the presence of my allies, I could "poison the well" so to speak, assuring that they would unwittingly spread the darkness themselves. And it didn't even have to feel like contempt. Just the subtlest sense of perceiving others as *intrinsically defective* — as though the darkness was *inherent* to their minds — was all it took. In other words, by simply entertaining the belief that there are *fundamentally* good vs bad people; those who deserve my compassion and those who deserve my contempt; I would unwittingly act as an agent of the darkness, one way or another.

I know this sounds hard to believe — and I wouldn't have believed it myself if not for what I so clearly saw. I realized that I had always known all this, but had somehow been hiding it from myself. I could *always* perceive the light in others — even in those who seemed convincingly not to have any — and yet part of my mind was shielding this perception from me, so that I could continue to perpetrate this ruse. Why? Because the perception of our unity is so *overwhelmingly awesome* — in the original sense of the word — that I felt I didn't deserve it. How could one deserve Infinite Glory when they are such a fuck-up?

In that moment I recognized myself in literally everyone else. There *is* no one "else." It is just me — and it is you. I do not feel worthy of coming Home yet, and so I project my own darkness onto you, where I can viciously attack it, thereby reinforcing the same misperception in you, thus perpetuating the whole illusion. It is always the same trick. The only way *anyone* can cause harm is by shielding themselves from perceiving the *life* in their victims — be they other people, animals, or Nature herself. And by hating them for making this mistake, I am driving that tendency deeper *into* their minds.

Let us close the loop. Part of me *knows* it is shoving them deeper into the abyss, and yet I hide that knowledge from myself. 





It became clear that contempt — that seemingly-innocuous feeling of being *intrinsically superior* to others — contains within it the kernel of *all the evil there ever was.* It didn't matter whether my target was "good" or "bad": simply by feeling contempt, I was telegraphing my own inner darkness to them — but in a way that was hidden from my own conscious mind. I would tell myself that this attitude was there to brighten the world by subduing evil, but a tiny part of me secretly knew better.

The trick was astonishing. The knowledge of my wrongdoing existed in a kind of limbo state: I simultaneously *knew* yet somehow *didn't.* I saw that it is this same trick that the "bad people" use to do what *they* do. Part of them knows *perfectly well* that they are doing wrong, but this knowledge is carefully shielded from conscious self-reflection, so that they can honestly claim *not* to know. By engaging in this self-deception myself, I was driving the same tendency deeper *into* their minds where I could then viciously judge them for it.

Seeing this, I immediately felt its malevolence. This is hard to put into words. It was as though I could always see the Light hidden beneath the delusion in others — and by labeling them "bad," I could get away with smothering it in the name of "good." I could see that part of them actually didn't want to be infected by the darkness — but instead of assisting that part, I forsook it.

I was shown how this single act of self-deception contains within it the seed of *all the evil there ever was* — and how fixing this one mistake would have implications far beyond my individual life.
 
It was revealed that part of me always knew *perfectly well* what I was doing, even though I claimed not to know. I was somehow shielding this knowledge from my own conscious mind, creating a kind of paradoxical state in which I both *knew* and yet *didn't.* This gave me plausible deniability: consciously, I was flawlessly convinced that I was doing good — even as part of me secretly knew better.

Subconsciously, I had believed that since even *I* wasn't aware of this subterfuge, others surely couldn't tell. This is the hardest thing to explain. Not only could they tell that I was acting out of malice — even though I myself couldn't — but the darkness within me *wanted* them to know. That was how the whole trick worked. It was as though the darkness in my own mind was leaking out through my eyes and into theirs, offering *their* darkness a secret handshake.

I was shown how incredibly subtle this process could be. I didn't even need to use mockery or shame to achieve it. Simply by *harboring contempt* — the mere feeling that others were *fundamentally defective* or *inferior* to myself, my darkness would somehow, one way or another, always leak out into the world in ways that I would never consciously recognize. It would then come boomeranging back, in some form, thus compelling me to escalate my self-righteous wrath.

I saw that this was the mechanism by which evil sustained itself — each one of us convinced that we are the "good guys," valiantly fighting the hordes of evil; never realizing that this very attitude was the surest sign that we were already under the sway of humanity's ultimate nemesis.

I saw that my urge to violently punish wrongdoers was secretly an excuse to indulge my *own* dark fantasies — but that I was able to disguise this fact so well that even *I* didn't know it. At the conscious level, it felt impossibly righteous; yet part of me somehow knew that my behavior would only darken the world. But how could I possibly know such a thing?

I saw that this is precisely the same trick that *all* people use to commit evil: we hide knowledge of our wrongdoing from our own conscious minds. It requires a kind of mental schism; a bizarre state in which we simultaneously *know* and yet somehow *do not.*

I was shown that the reason we must hide such knowledge from ourselves is that there is always a part of us that wouldn't tolerate it if only it knew. This is true of everyone, from the greatest saint to the worst sinner. The only difference is in how deeply hidden this aspect is from our conscious minds.

When I treat other people with contempt — that is, the belief that they are *fundamentally* defective or inferior — I am secretly trying to push them *further* from their inner Light.


---

The urge to violently punish others is secretly a desire to distance them *further* from their inner Light. Why would I want to do this? Because the further they get, the more different they seem from me.

It turns out I ultimately *am* everyone and everything else, but I'm not ready to see this yet. So I find clever ways to hide it. The cleverest of all is to divide the world into the *fundamentally good* and *fundamentally bad*; those who deserve my compassion and those who deserve my contempt.

The secret purpose of contempt is to express evil in a way that appears unmistakably righteous. By simply harboring this dark tendency, I telegraph to my enemy that I'm under the sway of the very illusion that I'm viciously judging them for, thereby provoking them into behavior that will prove me right about them.

I *need* to believe that evil exists only outside myself. With this single belief in place, I will *necessarily* locate its source in other humans, perceiving them as *fundamentally defective,* so that my cruelty becomes not only justified but morally necessary.

This is the very *essence* of evil. My enemy subconsciously recognizes this




How can I know this? Because 


The urge to violently punish others is secretly a desire to distance them *further* from their inner Light — because the further they get from it, the easier it becomes to convince myself that they *have* none, and that therefore my cruelty is righteous, leading to an unvirtuous cycle. But it isn't cruelty for cruelty's sake; the true purpose of making others worse is to hide my own darkness from myself.

I am shoving other people deeper into the abyss to prove to myself that I am good — and astonishingly, the *mere unconscious desire* to do this is itself enough to accomplish it. Why? Because it telegraphs to them that I am under the sway of the very thing that I am viciously judging them for, thereby causing them to see *me* as evil, thus compelling them to double down.

But it is not truly *me* doing this. No: what I ultimately am is my inner Light. The Darkness acts *through* me, but it is not what I am. It is not what *any* of us are. Yet it manipulates my perception so that I see them this way, thereby tricking me into strengthening its grip on them while letting me feel righteous about it.

It is as though the Darkness in my mind and theirs are working together by making us feel like we are fighting each other.

When we witness another person causing harm, we see the part that knows very well what they're doing; yet they somehow only see the part that doesn't.

I saw that the reason I mock and shame my enemies is not *despite* the fact that it makes them dig in their heels, but *because* of it: the feeling of righteously punishing evil was so satisfying that I wanted more of it, which I could get by being cruel — and that by branding it as "fighting evil," I could not only get away with it but be praised for it by my allies, the "good people." The deeper I shoved the "bad people" into the abyss, the more of this dark pleasure I could access.

I was shown the tremendous harm this caused — not only to my targets, but to countless others down the line: an already-overworked father going home and taking his humiliation out on his wife and children, who would then grow up to be "bad people" themselves — and who I could then blame for the sorry state of the world, never recognizing my own complicity.

I saw that producing these results didn't even require overt cruelty: simply *feeling malice* was enough to induce subtle effects that I could then use to justify more self-serving behavior. In fact, even malice wasn't required; *contempt* was enough. Simply by perceiving myself as *intrinsically superior* to others; seeing them as *fundamentally defective,* the world would become darker.

I was shown the fiendish mechanism by which this works: by harboring contempt, I secretly telegraph to my enemy that I'm caught in the same dark trap I'm viciously judging them for, thereby provoking them into seeing me as evil for the same reason I see them that way. This helps them alleviate any guilt they might have otherwise felt for their misbehavior, which I can then use as proof that they are indeed fundamentally defective, thus licensing me to escalate.

I saw that this process required a kind of cooperation: it only worked when my target had some darkness to provoke — which, thankfully, essentially everybody did, whether they knew it or not. It was as though my darkness was reaching out to offer theirs a secret handshake. This took place beneath our conscious thresholds, so that we could remain bitter enemies on the surface, even as our darkness was secretly allied. I saw its true goal: complete dominion over our reality.

The hardest part was being shown that I somehow knew all this *even as I did it.* This is paradoxical and hard to describe. On one hand, I had *no idea* and would have been genuinely mortified to learn of my profound complicity in what is essentially the *ultimate evil conspiracy*. On the other hand, I was shown clearly that some part of me did, indeed know. Worst of all, this knowledge wasn't truly unconscious: it was *completely accessible* to consciousness if only I had chosen to look. But I had been *choosing not to look*.

This is the secret mechanism behind *all the evil there ever was*. The "bad people" know *perfectly well* that they are doing wrong, but this knowledge is carefully shielded from conscious self-reflection, so that in another sense, they really do *not* know. The reason I hate them for this is not because of how *different* I am, but how *similar*. By hating them, I can increase the apparent contrast between us, but only at the horrific price of hiding from myself the profound malevolence of my behavior. It requires a painful split of the psyche — one that my conscious mind does not recognize, yet which still drives the majority of my behavior.

This is where the "bad people" are stuck. Through some confluence of circumstances, they have found themselves in a Mariana's Trench of self-deception, into which almost no light may enter. They give my own darkness the perfect opportunity to manifest: here is someone who no sane person would dare defend. I can therefore shove them deeper into the abyss while also getting maximum credit for the "good" this creates. And all it requires is a bit of contempt.





*Nothing* feels better than being forced to unleash the full extent of my righteous fury.
