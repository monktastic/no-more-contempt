I saw that the reason I mock and shame my enemies is not *despite* the fact that it makes them dig in their heels, but *because* of it: the feeling of righteously punishing evil was so satisfying that I wanted more of it, which I could get by being cruel — and that by branding it as "fighting evil," I could not only get away with it but be praised for it by my allies, the "good people." The deeper I shoved the "bad people" into the abyss, the more of this dark pleasure I could access.

I was shown the tremendous harm this caused — not only to my targets, but to countless others down the line: an already-overworked father going home and taking his humiliation out on his wife and children, who would then grow up to be "bad people" themselves — and who I could then blame for the sorry state of the world, never recognizing my own complicity.

I saw that producing these results didn't even require overt cruelty: simply *feeling malice* was enough to induce subtle effects that I could then use to justify more self-serving behavior. In fact, even malice wasn't required; *contempt* was enough. Simply by perceiving myself as *intrinsically superior* to others; seeing them as *fundamentally defective,* the world would become darker.

I was shown the fiendish mechanism by which this works: by harboring contempt, I secretly telegraph to my enemy that I'm caught in the same dark trap I'm viciously judging them for, thereby provoking them into seeing me as evil for the same reason I see them that way. This helps them alleviate any guilt they might have otherwise felt for their misbehavior, which I can then use as proof that they are indeed fundamentally defective, thus licensing me to escalate.

I saw that this process required a kind of cooperation: it only worked when my target had some darkness to provoke — which, thankfully, essentially everybody did, whether they knew it or not. It was as though my darkness was reaching out to offer theirs a secret handshake. This took place beneath our conscious thresholds, so that we could remain bitter enemies on the surface, even as our darkness was secretly allied. I saw its true goal: complete dominion over our reality.

The hardest part was being shown that I somehow knew all this *even as I did it.* This is paradoxical and hard to describe. On one hand, I had *no idea* and would have been genuinely mortified to learn of my profound complicity in what is essentially the *ultimate evil conspiracy*. On the other hand, I was shown clearly that some part of me did, indeed know. Worst of all, this knowledge wasn't truly unconscious: it was *completely accessible* to consciousness if only I had chosen to look. But I had been *choosing not to look*.

This is the secret mechanism behind *all the evil there ever was*. The "bad people" know *perfectly well* that they are doing wrong, but this knowledge is carefully shielded from conscious self-reflection, so that in another sense, they really do *not* know. The reason I hate them for this is not because of how *different* I am, but how *similar*. By hating them, I can increase the apparent contrast between us, but only at the horrific price of hiding from myself the profound malevolence of my behavior. It requires a painful split of the psyche — one that my conscious mind does not recognize, yet which still drives the majority of my behavior.

This is where the "bad people" are stuck. Through some confluence of circumstances, they have found themselves in a Mariana's Trench of self-deception, into which almost no light may enter. They give my own darkness the perfect opportunity to manifest: here is someone who no sane person would dare defend. I can therefore shove them deeper into the abyss while also getting maximum credit for the "good" this creates. And all it requires is a bit of contempt.





*Nothing* feels better than being forced to unleash the full extent of my righteous fury.
