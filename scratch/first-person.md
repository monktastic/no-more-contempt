## Prelude

Once, on a "heroic dose" of psilocybin, I was shown something that shattered my understanding of good and evil. It wasn't a gentle insight—it was a cascading series of revelations, each more horrifying than the last, that demolished my entire worldview and replaced it with something infinitely more mysterious and meaningful.

Two decades later, I'm still reeling from the consequences.

What I saw wasn't just about psychology or morality. It was about the fundamental architecture of evil itself—how it operates, how it spreads, and most disturbingly, how it uses _our own goodness_ as its primary transmission vector. By the end of that night, I understood why every major wisdom tradition has warned about the same thing, using different metaphors: there is something that hijacks human consciousness, turning it against itself. It coordinates across humans, and its most brilliant trick is convincing us it doesn't exist.

I saw how some of civilization's core assumptions—that hating bad people is good; that reality is composed of fundamentally inert "stuff"; that rational thought is our only reliable guide—were themselves vectors of the very darkness we claim to oppose. Not accidental side effects, but essential components of how it spreads.

What follows is an attempt to show you what I saw—and why it matters more urgently than almost anything else we could be paying attention to right now.

By necessity, I'll convey some of this in poetic terms; but there's also a technical component, which may help digest it for those whose minds work like mine. Of course, take everything I say with a grain of salt—it was a psychedelic trip, after all—but also, integral to the insight was that you already know everything I'm about to tell you, whoever you are. You _must_—because at the deepest level, I am you. But I'm getting ahead of myself.

A word about audience: if you need peer-reviewed studies before considering that consciousness might work differently than materialist assumptions suggest, this essay probably isn't for you—at least not yet. But if you've sensed something like this yourself, or if the way we collectively relate to "evil people" has started to feel deeply wrong in ways you can't quite articulate, then read on. This is an attempt to give language to something you may already know.

Throughout this essay, I'll refer to this coordinated system of self-deception as both "the pattern" and "the darkness"—they're the same thing. The pattern is how it operates; the darkness is what it does to reality. Use whichever helps you see it more clearly.

# Part I: The Mechanism
## The Limbo State

Think back to a time when you skirted your conscience—acted against your own deepest values while pretending it was okay. In that moment, part of you knew _perfectly well_ that you were doing wrong, but you shielded that knowledge from conscious awareness, so that it didn't _feel_ wrong. All you could hear were your own clever justifications. Knowledge of your wrongdoing existed in a kind of limbo state, in which you simultaneously _knew_ and yet somehow _didn't._

It’s a hidden trick of the mind that lets us cause harm while feeling justified. But why do we have to hide it? What are we hiding it _from_, exactly? It's almost as if there's a deeper part of us—call it our inner Light—that wouldn't tolerate it, if only it knew.

Here's what I was shown: this limbo state—a specific kind of self-deception—is the secret mechanism behind *all the evil there ever was.* Even the worst person can only cause harm by using exactly this trick to shield their minds from perceiving the _life_ in their victims—that spark that would remind them of themselves. If they could see it, they couldn't do it.

By hating them for it—a reaction that feels perfectly natural, even healthy—we are only *reinforcing* their capacity for self-deception. That's because we can only feel hatred—or its sophisticated cousin, contempt—by being in this state ourselves. Part of us knows that our hatred will only 




Now bring to mind someone you consider truly evil—not Hitler or some abstract monster, but someone real whose actions genuinely horrify you. Maybe a political figure, maybe someone from your own life, or maybe someone from the news. Can you feel that edge where your desire to see justice done crosses into something darker? An urge not just to stop them, but to see them suffer?

I know I could.

It feels like such people have no "inner Light," doesn't it?

But notice what happens when you believe that. Normally, you have an aversion to harming people because you perceive their innocence—their Light—and instinctively recoil from the horror of extinguishing it. But if they have no such Light? The guardrails come off—and this comes across in your behavior via countless subtle tells, whether you're aware of it or not.

It's almost as though we're communicating:

>_You deserve nothing but pain ever again—and I'll see to it that you receive it._

Part of us _wants_ them to hear this message. Delivering it feels impossibly righteous.

But consider how they perceive it. What they see is a self-professed "good person" willing to abandon their Light when push comes to shove; embracing their darkness instead. This doesn't make them _disavow_ their own darkness (as we might hope); it helps them justify it—giving us all the proof we need that they're utterly beyond redemption, and removing all remaining safeguards on our behavior.

## The ruse

Why had I thought that flashing them my own darkness would make them disavow theirs?

I was taken back to a moment when I had done exactly this. I felt like I was actually there—but instead of being in the limbo state (as I had been at the time), the hidden knowledge came crashing into consciousness.

First, I found a halfhearted explanation:

> _I'm giving them one final chance to repent—to return to the Light, where the rest of us live. If they don't take it, I'll know everything I need._

But this time around, I could sense that my intention wasn't entirely pure. An unconscious part of me had desperately _wanted_ them to make the wrong choice, so that I'd be forced to punish them for it. There was _nothing_ more viscerally satisfying than watching evil be violently punished.

_Shudder._

And this part of me couldn't just leave it to chance that they would make the wrong choice; it needed to _ensure_ they would. But how could I force somebody to embrace their darkness? Simply by hinting at such a malicious plan, I'd be giving away too much, and they would refuse to take the bait. Even worse, my own conscience might catch on and put a stop to it.

Much more clever would be to pretend I'm offering them a choice while secretly sealing off all the exits—and then hinting that I know that I'm doing this, but making it _look_ righteous, so that I could feign ignorance if questioned. _"Sorry, officer, I was only trying to fight evil!"_

The brilliant, layered malice of this trap would be too much to resist.

I also found that I could make a genuine fig leaf and a poisoned one appear almost completely identical, so that nobody—_including my own conscious mind_—could tell the difference. And yet it would still generate the outcome I desired: pushing evil closer to the brink, where the "good people" would be forced to punish it. That was a *good* outcome, so I could feel okay with it.

So that's exactly what I did.

## All the evil there ever was

My overt behavior appeared to be righteously combating their evil—but underneath, I was conveying something far more sinister. Something like:

> _I don't care if you really do have a Light and it's just been buried by some unthinkable pain. I'm going to smother it so thoroughly that nobody ever thinks to ask whether you have one again._

_Shudder._

At the time, part of me had known that my message was dark—but I had convinced myself it wasn't _real_ darkness; it was merely _strategic_, designed to intimidate them into stopping, as a service to humanity. But once it was brought into full awareness, there was no mistaking what it was. I saw that we *both* knew what it was—and that the *other* knew, too, even if not consciously.

But this would mean that I was *knowingly* creating more evil, just to give me the perverse pleasure of punishing it—and hiding it from myself, so that it wouldn't feel wrong. This was bad enough, but it also meant that—_oh, God_—I knew exactly how it was possible for a fundamentally decent person to commit great evil. _All that's required is to hide it from ourselves carefully enough!_

_"Yes, yes,"_ the medicine gently nudged. _"And what else did you know?"_

I was taken a level deeper.

I saw that the deepest part of me had actually been able to see their Light—could see that their darkness was covering something pure, something confused, something _reachable_. The actual message I had been conveying was thus closer to:

> _We both know I can see your Light—and that your evil is a distorted cry for help. We both know I could lead you back toward it while still serving justice. But no one can prove I knew that—not even me—so no one will be able to blame me when I snuff it out. Yet we will both know, deep down, what I've done. Good luck._

_No, no, no, no, no, no, no._

It wasn't just "dark"—it was *pure malevolence*; the very essence of evil. I wasn't "merely" driving a fundamentally defective person to commit more evil; I was shoving an inherently redeemable one deeper into the abyss that enables evil in the first place, to prove that it's all they're capable of. I knew that, and they *knew* I knew that—which is why it had the effect it did.

I wriggled and squirmed and fought as hard as I could, but there was no denying it. I tried to insist it had been unconscious, but I saw that wasn't exactly true either. Through dozens of examples, I was shown exactly where this knowledge had been available to my conscious mind, if only I'd been willing to look. But I had _chosen not to look_.

That's when the full veil was lifted.

All the horror. All the pain. All the darkness in this world. It is all made possible by a single error: _choosing not to look_. I saw how even the worst person can only cause harm by shielding their minds from perceiving the _life_ in their victims—that spark that would remind them of their own—using exactly the same trick. It was the single essential ingredient in *all the evil there ever was.*

As if to quell any doubts, the medicine turned up the volume on my "shielding" knob to its maximum, and showed me what the world looked like through that lens. The way I felt toward other beings—or should I say, _things_—was... well, I will leave that to your imagination.

---

To be clear: this knowledge, and the choice not to look, are not conscious in the usual sense of the word. To suggest so would be irresponsible. Not only would it trivialize the problem of evil, but it provides the kernel around which contempt crystallizes—the very mistake we just deconstructed.

Yet there is indeed a bizarre sense in which it always perfectly accessible to our conscious minds. We can sense this, which is why we feel an authentic desire to make the "bad people" face what they're doing. We know that on some level, they *know*—and if we just found a way to make them confront it, they would stop. [Might start losing readers here.]

The medicine was showing me that this was true—that in fact, that's what it was doing for me right now. It was holding my feet to the fire, exposing all my hidden darkness—and there was nothing soft or gentle about it. It was a relentless onslaught, and it refused to let me look away.

Yet it lacked that accusatory *sting* that I was used to receiving when having my deepest flaws pointed out—and that's almost inevitable in human interaction. That's because it was simultaneously revealing the deeper part of me—my Light—that was free of all darkness.

The message was clear: 

That combination—fierce but [???]—was what allowed me to really see it for the first time.

The message was clear: compassion doesn't have to be nice or gentle.




The reason I hadn't noticed mine is that I was overly focused on my intellect: the part of mind that thinks, plans, remembers... and also justifies and rationalizes.

I saw that there was no way to determine whether something was a rationalization by thinking harder about it, or even by incorporating new information.


---

Questions remained:
- Why was I doing it?
- How did I know they knew I knew?
- How did I communicate it over such a narrow channel? How did I know it would be received?
- Was I supposed to be nice?

[This horror revealed a deeper coordination—a mechanism I was shown next.]

In that impossibly dark place, I felt what it was like to be forsaken by the Light. But rather than feeling forsaken, I felt... free. Unburdened by any concept of Light. 

—*seemingly,* anyway. Because the 


The implications kept cascading.

If I could see their Light and chose to smother it—if that's what contempt actually *was*—then what was I really doing? 

I saw that the intention to snuff out another's Light is often enough to drive them into the arms of their darkness. Phrased like that, it sounds obvious. But another way of looking at it is that it drives them *away* from their Light—the two being opposite ends of the same spectrum. And being far from your Light is effectively the same as it being smothered. It never actually stops shining—it can't—we just get too far away to hear it, and that is a dark place indeed.

So the mere intention to drive others toward their darkness is enough to actually accomplish it. Said that way, it sounds less oppositional and more collaborative, doesn't it?

I wasn't threatening to shove them deeper into the abyss; I was *inviting* them to join me there.

---

[Then the knob was set to absolute zero, and I saw what I was underneath it all.]
[The same plausible deniability that corporations use]
[Mockery as a mild example of same thing; contempt as a secret signal; how contempt-compassion is a second axis (first is nice-fierce). My excuse had always been "well I can't just be nice!" but I knew that was inauthentic]
[Introducing contempt as the universal darkness. The reason we cut down rainforests etc.]
[Trying to rub their noses in it doesn't work because it's not meant to]
[Why does a simple glance smother your Light / make you embrace your darkness? Poetic vs technical answers. Poetic is resonance => contagion. Why is smothering Light = embrace darkness = shove into abyss?]
[The voice felt parasitic]
[The darkness in you lives in me too, so watch out vs so let's join forces.]
[We don't have conscious control over how "shielded" we are, so calling it a "choice" isn't exactly right, either.]

It's as if the darkness in other people *wants* us to hate them, because by doing so, we feed it.

And when others choose not to look, it somehow convinces *us* to do the same. 

But how does this mechanism actually work? How can contempt—something that feels so righteous, so justified—actually *spread* the very evil it claims to oppose? The answer lies in something stranger than I ever imagined...


"Are you kidding? You're seeing this all the time. You've just forgotten somehow."

---

- "...deliberately smothering the Light in fundamentally innocent beings."

---
---


[Something about how this was the secret behind all the evil there ever was—and it lived within me.]

All the darkness in the world lived within me, too. *That's* what my contempt had been meant to reveal to them


My contempt had been my way of flashing it to them—ostensibly to make them abandon their evil, but actually to reinforce it. The way I had hidden this was by convincing myself that mine wasn't *real* darkness, but merely strategic. But that was actually a trick it had pulled on me, so that I would go through with its plan.



But I now saw that the real purpose had been to justify my perception of them as fundamentally different from myself.

In other words, I had always *known* that they only way they could cause harm was by doing exactly the same thing I was doing now


The hypocrisy was overwhelming. I was shoving fundamentally redeemable beings deeper into the abyss to prove my own righteousness.

"But this would mean that I'm only doing the same thing they are."

[1. How did I convey all that with just a glance? 2. Why did it have the effect it did [further from light / toward darkness = same thing]? 3. What was I trying to accomplish?]

[and that's why I had hidden]

[The choice to see someone as fundamentally defective / "less than" is an encoded intention to drive them further from their Light.]



It was the _perfect_ crime—except for one little thing: part of me would always know the truth.

---

Have you felt that edge where the desire to see justice crosses over to something darker: an urge to see them suffer? To forsake them completely? I know I have. 

But what exactly is it that makes it "dark"? What's so wrong with wanting them to feel exactly how their victims felt?

Before that night, I understood in an abstract way that wanting to see *anyone* suffer is somehow wrong, but I couldn't have told you exactly why. It just seemed like one of those things good people are supposed to believe—perhaps a religious vestige that hadn't yet been corrected by science. By what mechanism could a mere emotion—however ugly—actually cause harm? By whose definition did it even qualify as "wrong"?

I also knew that moral absolutes are dangerous. We can't take a rule that applies to *most* people *most* of the time and apply it to everyone, everywhere. That kind of moral naiveté is how we got into this mess in the first place. Evil seemed to be winning, and if the good people remained bound by archaic principles that the bad people openly exploited, things would only get worse.

But what I saw that night obliterated this perspective completely.

I saw how the urge to make them hurt originated not from my authentic goodness, but from the same dark aspect of mind that enabled their behavior in the first place—and that by acting on it, I would necessarily reinforce that pattern in humanity. Even stranger, "acting on it" could be as subtle as giving them a dehumanizing glare, or even describing them as "evil" to other people.

[and that by simply having originated from this place, I would necessarily reinforce that pattern?]

Each of these actions fostered _contempt_ in others—my enemy, friends, strangers—which they would pass on in countless invisible ways, morphing into forms that could never be traced back to my behavior, ultimately causing harms I would never recognize my complicity in.

And here's what made it devastating: part of me had _known_ this even as I was doing it. Not exactly a conscious part, mind you—but not exactly unconscious, either. But most horrifying of all—and this still sends a shudder down my spine—I didn't act _despite_ knowing the harm it would cause, but _because_ of it.

It was as though some hidden part of me took pleasure in watching beings suffer, without regard for guilt or innocence. It was the *same* part that operated in my enemies—and they could only operate by staying beneath our radar. By doing so, they could even coordinate with each other. When my contempt provoked my enemy's, it wasn't an accident—it was these aspects of our minds resonating with each other to spread the contagion further.

My hatred for the people cutting down the rainforests therefore didn't *slow* the destruction; it somehow accelerated it.

I know how crazy this sounds. Let me start with something concrete.


~~Yes, you read that right. Part of me was *evil.* It still is—and unless you're Jesus or the Buddha, it lives in you, too.~~

~~You may think I'm exaggerating when I use this word—evil—but it was made painfully clear to me that the malice I felt for "bad people" was made of exactly the same "stuff" as [...]~~

---
---

Here's what I was shown.

I was taken back to a moment in time where this had happened, and shown the full contents of my conscious mind.

I knew I wanted to see them suffer, but I knew that revealing it (e.g., by being overtly cruel) would make me look evil. Part of me also secretly suspected that:

- It actually *is* evil. Enjoying suffering is always evil, no matter who it's aimed at. (Why did I know it was evil? What does evil even mean? The full revelation depends on a later insight, but is also required to get there. Is this plausible enough to most people or should I reword it? "There's something dark about wanting to see *anyone* suffer, even if I couldn't say exactly why?")
- It would make them worse people.
- It would increase the "net darkness" in the world. 

So if I was going to make them suffer, I knew I had to hide it—not only from others, but also myself. 

The first step was to write off all of the above knowledge as mere intuition, since intuition is obviously fallible. I knew this actually had a distinct, authoritative signature (conscience), but nobody could prove that I knew (including myself)—so in effect, I didn't know.

Instead, I would trust my concrete thoughts—which, conveniently, our culture recognizes as the only valid way of knowing. My thoughts said:

- I don't actually *want* to see them suffer! I'm not enjoying it!
- It's righteous justice. So what if it hurts them? They *deserve* to feel what their victims felt. (This was only possible by confusing two different kinds of hurt: hurting them out of necessity vs for suffering's sake. These are really malicious vs compassionate intent, but that might be begging the question, since the whole piece is about distinguishing these two. This is where the spiral discovery comes in. Start with a very vague distinction and refine it?)
- It won't actually make them worse: they'll realize what they're doing and stop.
- Even if it does make them worse, it's offset by the good it does (temporarily stopping them; dissuading others)
- Best of all: digging in their heels would be proof that they're evil (otherwise they would see I'm doing good), and is therefore a net good for the world.

So part of me *knew* that the only way I could hurt them was by ignoring an inner knowledge by pretending it didn't exist, and instead listen to thoughts that I *knew* were rationalizations but couldn't admit to myself I knew—so that they felt 100% like truth and not just rationalizations.

Wait, that meant that I could commit evil despite being a good person.

~~I saw that by lying to myself in this way, I'd be giving away~~

Hmm... but if even a good person like me could be malicious

Oh! This must also be why I suspected that it might make them worse people. Maybe they, like me, could only do wrong was by hiding something from themselves exactly the way I was attempting to do right now. And I know that contempt makes *me* worse. But that would mean that my contempt isn't justified, and I didn't like that thought, so I buried it.

I secretly knew this would help me justify my perception of them.


---


Can you feel how easy it is to disguise the latter as the former? To devise a plan that will stop them while *also* making them suffer, and then claim that there was no better way—knowing perfectly well that there was?

Here's what I was shown: I do this all the time, but with such astonishing subtlety that nobody will ever detect it and thus judge me for it. In so doing, I am feeding the very darkness I claim to oppose—and part of me has always known this.

The subtlety I'm describing must be seen to be believed. I will try to convey a taste of it.

Making someone suffer normally requires overt cruelty

. On the other hand



Here's what I was shown: by simply *entertaining* that dark thought, I was communicating to the world my willingness to execute it.



Can you feel how easy it is to disguise the latter as the former—how we can take a perfectly noble plan and secretly embed malice in it, in a way that no one will notice?

I was shown how two actions that can look nearly identical on the surface can produce drastically different long-term effects—and how all it takes is to simply *hint* at our dark intent.


The difference can be as subtle as a twinkle in the eye—a look that does nothing more than convey this dark intent.



Here's what I was shown: I do this all the time.



I certainly can. I hated what the "bad people" were doing—but more than that, I hated _them._ Who wouldn't?



---

[It's difficult to convey what it's like to be shown that you knew something at the time it happened, even though *while* it was happening you were completely certain you didn't—like that limbo state. It was like I had cast a spell over myself, where by pretending I couldn't see something, it's as if I couldn't. But the spell was wearing off now—and the knowledge returned not only in the present, but somehow retroactively back to when it was first suppressed.]

It's difficult not to hate them, isn't it? I know it is for me. But here's what I was shown.

By hating them, I was revealing my own darkness. I had assumed its purpose was to hint at what I was really capable of if pushed, so that they would stop—a noble intention. But I saw that all it actually did was make things worse. It made them perceive *me* as slightly evil, thus increasing their need to self-deceive; reinforcing their capacity for evil.

There were two parallel trains of thought running.

I had an inkling that there was Light somewhere deep within them, and I wanted them to feel what it was like to be cut off from it—just as they'd done to their victims. My hatred had been a primal threat. It said: no matter what you do, I'm going to make sure you never return Home.


I saw that by hating them, I had been reinforcing their self-deception, by driving them further from their Light (but how did I know they had Light?). This made them commit more evil.

I was shown that I had known this even as I was doing it. I *knew* I was reinforcing evil. But worse, I saw that it wasn't an accident. It's not that I had meant to stop their evil but *accidentally* reinforced it—it's that I *wanted* to reinforce it.

I fought this recognition as hard as I could. What kind of person would knowingly reinforce evil? No way, not me.

But I was taken back to moments where I expressed hatred, and was shown exactly where in my conscious mind this knowledge had existed, hidden in plain sight. "See? Right here." As hard as I squirmed and wriggled, there was no denying it: it really *had* been on purpose. But why?

I had an inkling that there was Light somewhere deep within them, and I wanted them to feel what it was like to be cut off from it, just as they'd done to their victims. My hatred had been a primal threat. It said: no matter what you do, I'm going to make sure you never return Home.




And I knew I would get away with it.




and double down—while giving myself plausible deniability. I'm only fighting evil.



had actively *wanted* to shove them deeper into the abyss, out of the simple desire to see them *hurt*.

I thought that this would finally make them understand how their victims felt, so that they would feel it and stop—but I also knew that this was a lie. I *knew* they didn't yet have the capacity to connect the dots between their own suffering and others', and that forcibly trying would only make it harder—but the sheer pleasure of making them suffer overrode that knowledge.

By tasting it so directly, I came to recognize what that feeling was.

*Malevolence*. The desire to see other beings burn; to rob them of hope; to forsake them to the darkness. 

Shivers down the spine. 

*Malevolence.* The primordial nemesis of the Light. The source of all that is Bad.

I was sacrificing my enemy to it, in the supposed name of Good, knowing that I would get away with it.

I therefore saw how even a fundamentally decent person can enact great evil. Which would mean that... *no, no, no, no, no. What if they were only doing the same thing? It couldn't be!*

*"Yes, yes, now you're starting to see..."*

The trick I used to hide this knowledge from myself was exactly the same trick they used: I had to shield myself from perceiving their Light in order to take pleasure in smothering it—and by doing so, I was reinforcing their capacity to do the same. I was *feeding* the Great Darkness.




I was shown that to do this, I had to place myself under exactly the same spell that had enabled *them* to cause harm. But why would they need to cast a spell over themselves, unless... *oh, shit. There was Light in there, too!*

This wasn't a logical inference. I saw it clear as day. But more than that: I had *always* seen it; *could* always see it. *This isn't something you're realizing now*, it showed me, *it's something you've always known. LOOK.* The veil was once again lifted retroactively. I *had* always seen it! 

Pure Light without characteristics, whose true nature is Love. Incapable of wishing harm. That which doesn't have to be produced, but is all that remains once all self-deception has evaporated. It is what I *was*. What we *all* were.

How could I ever forget?!

This meant that I had *knowingly* been gleefully shoving fundamentally innocent beings—badly confused people, identical to myself at the very deepest level—into the abyss.

The message was clear: this is how it is possible for someone whose true nature is infinite Love—YOU—to commit great evil. This is exactly how you do it—how you've *been* doing it. It is exactly the same way *they* do it. You *know* this.

[Why do I call this paradoxical? Because this was the insight that kicked off the chain that ended here. Is there a way to linearize this, to break the circular dependency? Perhaps: self-deception lifts, my Light is revealed, I see that I've always seen their Light, which means I've always known I'm harming innocents, which means I always knew the trick that allows people to commit evil, which means I knew what they were doing all along... except that this is already covered by the fact that I could always see their Light]

I was shown two paths.

First, by healing my own capacity for self-deception, I could increasingly recover my perception of Light not only in myself but in others. I would increasingly see how the harm they cause is the product of *their* self-deception, which would enable me to heal it. I could still force them to confront it—but in a Loving way. That doesn't mean a gentle way. It might be a firm way; a fierce way; even a violent way. But by being fundamentally motivated by great Love, their defenses would be lowered to allow this knowledge in—in exactly the way that was being done for me right now, in fact. This would cause the evil in the world to slowly evaporate.

Alternatively, I could maintain my perception of them as fundamentally unlike myself. This would continue to provide me with the pleasure of watching evil be tortured—but it would also mean that evil would continue to exist in this world, thus providing me more hits of pleasure, in a never-ending cycle. The sign that you have chosen this path is: *contempt.* That is the simplest English word to describe that desire to rub their noses in their evil despite knowing it doesn't help.

The choice was mine.

Once, on a "heroic dose" of psilocybin, I was shown something that shattered my understanding of good and evil. It wasn't a gentle insight—it was a cascading series of revelations, each more horrifying than the last, that demolished my entire worldview and replaced it with something infinitely more mysterious and meaningful.

Two decades later, I'm still reeling from the consequences.

By necessity, I'll convey it in poetic terms; but there's also a technical component, which may help digest it for those whose minds work like mine.

Of course, take everything I say with a grain of salt—it was a psychedelic trip, after all—but also, integral to the insight was that you already know everything I'm about to tell you, whoever you are. You must—because I am you. But I'm getting ahead of myself.

Think back to a time when you skirted your conscience—acted against your own deepest values while pretending it was okay. In that moment, part of you knew *perfectly well* that you were doing wrong, but you shielded that knowledge from conscious awareness, so that it didn't *feel* wrong. All you could hear were your own clever justifications. Knowledge of your wrongdoing existed in a kind of limbo state, in which you simultaneously *knew* and yet somehow *didn't.*

Now bring to mind someone you consider truly evil—not Hitler or some abstract monster, but someone real whose actions genuinely horrify you. Maybe a political figure, maybe someone from your own life, or maybe someone from the news.

Can you feel that edge where your desire to see justice done crosses into something darker? An urge not just to stop them, but to see them suffer?

I certainly can. I was shown that while this urge felt like it was coming from my authentic goodness, it was actually feeding the very darkness I claimed to oppose. Not *accidentally*, mind you, but *intentionally*.

But why? And how?

Every bone in my body needed to believe that such people weren't just different from me, but somehow *fundamentally* so. Sure, I had done things before that I knew were harmful at the time, but *their* behavior was something quite different; something alien—or was it?

I saw that the thought itself—*you and I are nothing alike*—wasn't a neutral observation, but a self-fulfilling prophecy. It's as though I was whispering: *we all see that you are lost, so I will pretend to lead you home... while secretly driving you further from it. I will then erase the evidence from my own mind, so that even I will never know what I've done.*

That chilling message went so far beyond malicious that it looped around to being... _relieving_. It freed them of the burden of trying to resist their darkness—a struggle every one of us knows all too well. Indeed, it was the very struggle I was confronted with in that moment.

I knew that if I lost that struggle, I would license them to lose theirs. Because I was a *good person,* I couldn't let that happen—at least, not obviously. Luckily, there was a solution.

I knew that overt cruelty was wrong, but who could fault me for feeling contempt? They're *evil*, for chrissake! I was *not* giving in to my darkness, but doing God's work—which meant that when they inevitably embraced *their* darkness, it would be entirely on them.

It was the *perfect* crime. Except for one small thing.

---

First, let's look at how this plan worked. How could something as simple as *contempt* convey such a complex, dynamic, malevolent message? 

The answer lies in a paradox of shared knowledge.

You see, not only do we know that we're not intrinsically superior to others; they *know* we know; and we *know* they know we know; etc. This is called *common knowledge*, in a [precise technical sense](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_knowledge_(logic)). It is therefore also common knowledge that *pretending* to be superior—and punishing them on that basis—is profoundly hypocritical, and will only reinforce their darkness; which we can then blame them for—which they *also* know we know they know; etc.

But how is this possible? How could we have common knowledge with complete strangers?

It's because we both retain a subtle memory of our common origin.

You can think of this in physicalist terms if you wish—i.e., the origin of life, or the Big Bang or whatever—but this doesn't do it full justice, so I'll resort to poetry again.

The Life I see in you is the same Life I feel in me. They're not just similar, or even merely identical. They're somehow the *very same thing*. I know this, you know this, I know you know this, etc.

But I also know our rational minds can't fully grasp this—which means nobody can accuse me of knowing it. That's why the trap works.

---

It is also why the trap must eventually *fail*; why my "perfect crime" would inevitably be exposed.

Life knows when it's lying to itself—and that knowledge doesn't just evaporate. It gets woven into the very fabric of reality itself.

The darkness I express to my enemy becomes theirs, rippling outward, making it impossible to trace back to me. Events distant in time and space—atrocities across the globe—may be partially due to acts of self-deception I committed years ago, but I will never know it.

Except that that's not quite true.

Somehow, reality finds ways to mirror our own disowned darkness back to us. I was shown how patterns repeating in my life—news stories with a common theme, mistreatment from others with a similar flavor—bore a striking resemblance to misdeeds I myself had committed and long since "forgotten." 

It's as if reality was begging me to clean up something in myself—but I kept taking it as a message to fix *other people*—which only made the problem worse.

Why had I never noticed this before? Because it was *too painful to bear*. Reality was showing me my own reflection all the time, but I wasn't ready to see it. So I studiously avoided it with drugs, alcohol, TV, you name it.

Nobody wants to recognize the darkness in the world as connected to their own. So we invent the ultimate lie: that the darkness is due to evil people, fundamentally different from us, whom we can never understand, only valiantly fight.

It is a deal with the Devil that we all make. I'll hide my darkness in you, and you hide yours in me, so that neither of us will ever have to confront what we've done.

---

As it happens, this analogy is more apropos than it may first seem.




---
---

[The way *you* express darkness is influenced by the particulars of your psyche, and may be completely different from my own. Some people use their self-deception to covet money and power, while others—ironically—use it to prove themselves "good people," who deserve to treat the bad guys with contempt.]





---

 To forsake them completely?

---
---

It's the same trick that enables "evil people" to do the horrible things *they* do. They must shield their minds from fully perceiving the life in their victims—that spark that would remind them of themselves—or else they couldn't do it.

It's also how humanity can plunder nature for convenience and profit. We must overlook its sacredness by deactivating the part of us that can see it.

This is why our dominant narrative tells us that reality is a fundamentally lifeless collection of *stuff*. We think we deduced this through careful reasoning and evidence, but the truth is that we knew it was the only way we could ravage and dominate our world without compunction. 

There is no amount of logic or reasoning that can prove any of these behaviors wrong. Or rather, we can easily prove them right *or* wrong depending on which best serves our interests at the time, without ever realizing that this is what we're really doing. 

There is literally no way for our intellect to discover that we're deceiving ourselves—which is exactly why we trust it to be our sole arbiter.

This way, when all the harm is done, we can look back and pretend we had no way of knowing.

---

It's very difficult to look at an evil person and not hate them for it. But here's what's secretly happening when we do that. I'll switch to first person to keep it more honest.

I saw that my hatred made them worse people, by justifying their need to deceive themselves.

I saw that I had known this, even as I was doing it.

I did it not *despite* knowing this, but *because* of it. In other words, I was actively *trying* to make them worse, and I knew that, too. But why?

Because I could see my own self-deception in them, and I hated it—so I felt the need to hide this similarity from myself and the world. But how?

I knew that the only way a person could feel hatred for another was by deceiving themselves—and moreover, I knew that *they* knew that, and that they *knew* I knew they knew, *ad infinitum*. More on that in a moment.

So I knew that my hatred would subconsciously reveal that I knew I was no better than them, and that it would trigger their "evil detector" for the same reason theirs triggered mine. I knew this would help them justify whatever storyline was driving their misbehavior, and that when it inevitably made them worse, I could use that as more reason for cruelty.

And I made sure they knew all of that, and *also* that I was hiding it from myself.

But how does one pass such a convoluted message through as simple a channel as *hatred*? How could I already know they knew I knew they knew etc.?

---

That kind of recursive shared knowing is what logicians know as [common knowledge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_knowledge_(logic)). But how could I have common knowledge with a complete stranger?

It's because we both retain a subtle memory of our common origin.

You can think of this in physicalist terms if you wish—the origin of life, or the Big Bang or whatever—but it doesn't capture the full picture. The map is not the territory.

The Life I see in you is the same Life I feel in myself. They're not just similar, or even merely identical. They're somehow the *very same thing*.

I know this, you know this, I know you know this, etc.

I therefore know that by *pretending* to be fundamentally superior, I will trigger your BS detector, and that you'll *know* I'm doing this, etc.

But neither one of us can prove that this is what's happening. Therefore, I'm committing the perfect crime—which I *also* know you know, etc.

How do you know if you're deceiving yourself? The first clue is that it will feel like you are definitely not deceiving yourself—and you will have an airtight case to prove it. But this is obviously not actionable on its own, so [...]

What you are is life itself. And when you know this, not as an idea, not as a concept... your every behavior somehow serves life as a whole; rescues it from the abyss. When it becomes conceptual, it gets usurped by the individual, by the ego. "I'm going to hoard wealth and resources so that I can implement my clever strategy to ensure survival." "I'm going to punish the bad guys, to make sure the good guys win." Ends justify the means, but also so much more. Calculating the optimal strategy.

To the degree one has recognized oneself at life, such calculations help. For one who has not, they are only lies.

How does it work? My own mind has to enter the abyss, and in so doing, it demonstrates to others that darkness is the way.

To pull them back from the brink. Not for their personal sake because maybe they don't personally deserve it. But because otherwise I'm making a sacrifice to the darkness.

The darkness seducing me in exactly the same way it seduced him, and by giving in to it, I teach it how to seduce others.

"Life uh finds a way."

Relegate their mind to the abyss.



I saw that simply by formulating this very thought—*you and I are nothing alike*—I was powerfully inviting them to prove it. It's as if part of me was saying: *I can see there's no hope of you ever returning to the Light, so I'm not even going to give you that option. In fact, I will personally hand-deliver you to the darkness, where you clearly belong.*

That message went so far beyond malicious that it looped around to being... *relieving*. It freed them of the burden of trying to resist their darkness—a struggle that every one of us knows all too well. Indeed, it was the very struggle that I was confronted with in that moment.

By simply entertaining the *idea* of losing that struggle, I was showing them that it's not worth trying to fight it themselves. That at the end of the day, we all know who the real victor is in the eternal battle between darkness and Light.


---
---

I was shown how much I enjoyed mocking and shaming my enemies—the *bad people.* I knew that it would only make them dig in their heels and fight back harder, but I'd convinced myself that it was a net good: I wasn't creating new darkness in the world, but merely exposing the evil already latent in their minds, for all the world to see—a kind of public service.

I was then shown that my behavior *had* actually increased the "net darkness" in the world—and that moreover, part of me had known this, even as I did it. But I had convinced myself that I didn't know; that I *couldn't know*—and that therefore, that nobody else could accuse me of ill intent.

But it turned out my enemy somehow *did* know; and moreover, I knew this, too—again, even as I did it. I saw that part of me had *wanted* them to recognize my malicious intent—provided that I had plausible deniability, which I did. I was only *fighting evil,* after all—and how could that ever be wrong?

Something in my mind was able to create *new evil* in the world in a way that I could plausibly deny, so that even *I* wouldn't know—and all it had to do to accomplish this was to telegraph itself to others while hiding itself from me.

---
---

I saw why I enjoy mocking and shaming my enemies: they are *fundamentally* defective and thus beyond help. My compassion would therefore be wasted on them. The only option is to punish them in hopes of making their evil submit.

I saw that a deeper part of me knew this was a lie: that my cruelty would only drive the darkness deeper *into* their minds—which was only possible because it wasn't *intrinsic* to them in the first place. I had only convinced myself that it was in order to justify cruelty. Deep down, I had always known this—but I had tucked that knowledge away so carefully that it was exactly as if I *hadn't* known.

I saw that this was the secret trick behind *all the evil there ever was.* Even the worst person can only cause harm by shielding knowledge of its wrongness from conscious self-reflection in exactly this way. It is never possible to *prove* that someone is doing this, but it always carries a specific signature—which we identify as "evil."

A person acting from this place is always seeking to benefit themselves at the world's expense, whether they realize it or not—and this *always* ends up darkening the world, one way or another. But the mechanism by which it does so can be nearly impossible to detect, in proportion to how elaborate the self-deception.

By treating my enemies with contempt, I was therefore revealing to them the darkness in my *own* mind—which they subconsciously recognized, giving them the perfect excuse to further embrace their own. But *this wasn't by accident.* The darkness in my mind was *telegraphing* itself to them specifically to provoke this response.

Evil can only exist by hiding itself from us, and so it does everything in its power to prevent us from looking within. It keeps our attention fixated perpetually outward, where we feel compelled to viciously attack it in others. But this only makes them *less* likely to introspect, which we take as a sign that they indeed *fundamentally* defective—never realizing that we were actually doing our best to *stop* them from reflecting. We thus see more evil in the world, which our darkness uses to ingratiates itself further to us, convincing us that it is *necessary and righteous*.

Darkness never *feels* dark. It always feels justified; as though it is a protector against the evil "out there"—but this is its greatest deception. In truth, all the darkness in the world is secretly *allied*; behaving more like a *singular distributed malevolent entity*, manipulating all of humanity from beneath our conscious thresholds. The Christians know it as the Devil, and the Buddhists call it the Ego. It is the reason many believe in an *evil global conspiracy* pulling the strings from behind the scenes.

It is the *primordial* evil conspiracy; the one to which all the rest owe their existence, and to which they ultimately report. Every attempt to bring it down without being free of it yourself only ends up reinforcing it, because that confused impulse is only ever generated *by* it. And how do you know if you're free of it?


[Hides itself perfectly from view...]

always feels justified, or even necessary, to protect you—or perhaps the innocents—from all the darkness *out there.* It feels *righteous*—but in truth, the two are secretly allied. It never actually fights the evil in others, but only pretends to; amplifying itself while paradoxically hiding itself in increasingly clever ways from all involved.



But the darkness in here is not merely *of the same kind* as the darkness out there—it is somehow the *very same thing*. This is nearly impossible to communicate.




---
---

I was shown how much I enjoyed mocking and shaming people — my political opponents, "evil people," conspiracy nutjobs, etc. I had been so sure that it was to *help* the world, but now I saw that it was simply because I enjoyed seeing them suffer. It was *malicious* — but it got worse.

I saw that a part of me knew this even as I did it — but I had somehow hidden that knowledge from myself, so that in a bizarre and paradoxical sense, I also *didn't* know. This is very hard to describe. It's as though the part of me I normally think of as "me" only had access to the lie — and yet the truth wasn't exactly inaccessible, either. It was just shielded from conscious self-reflection, in order to maintain my self-image as a "good person." And there was more.

I was shown that this mechanism of self-deception was *exactly* the same trick that the "evil" people used to hide knowledge of their wrongdoing from themselves — but the really crazy part was that I *knew this, too.* Not in an abstract sense, either: it turns out I could *always* perceive the aspect of their mind that lay beneath the self-deception — the part that is literally incapable of malicious intent.

But this would mean that I had enjoyed seeing *fundamentally innocent beings* suffer! That couldn't be! I was *good*! Yet the harder I tried to deny it, the more powerfully I was confronted with the fact that I had *always* known it — because *they were me!* It had *always* only ever been me! One consciousness, peering out through countless eyes; only wearing different masks!

There were no "good" or "bad" people, because consciousness itself is fundamentally without characteristics; without content. "Good" and "bad" referred only to *how powerfully* a particular being had hidden this knowledge from themselves — for it is only by hiding it that we are ever able to wish any kind of harm on others, or want more for ourselves at their expense.


So then why had I taken pleasure in harming them — other versions of me? This is especially gnarly to communicate.


---
---

I saw that the real reason I mock and shame my enemies is not to help them — or anyone else — see the light, but to nudge them *toward* the very darkness that I claim to oppose. The worse they became as people, the more reassured I would feel of my own place in the world; that I was one of the precious few "good guys," valiantly fighting the hordes of evil — a phenomenon that lived only outside myself.

I discovered that I didn't even need overt cruelty to accomplish this goal: simply by harboring *contempt* — that seemingly-innocuous feeling of being *intrinsically superior* to others — I could push people toward the abyss. This is difficult to describe. I saw that contempt is the darkness in my own mind flashing itself to others in order to provoke them into perceiving *me* as evil, so that they would feel compelled to fight back — which I could then use as evidence that I was right about them. After all, I am *not* evil — and if they think so, it only proves how *bad* they are.

I didn't even need to display my contempt directly to my enemy. Simply by feeling it in the presence of my allies, I could "poison the well" so to speak, assuring that they would unwittingly spread the darkness themselves. And it didn't even have to feel like contempt. Just the subtlest sense of perceiving others as *intrinsically defective* — as though the darkness was *inherent* to their minds — was all it took. In other words, by simply entertaining the belief that there are *fundamentally* good vs bad people; those who deserve my compassion and those who deserve my contempt; I would unwittingly act as an agent of the darkness, one way or another.

I know this sounds hard to believe — and I wouldn't have believed it myself if not for what I so clearly saw. I realized that I had always known all this, but had somehow been hiding it from myself. I could *always* perceive the light in others — even in those who seemed convincingly not to have any — and yet part of my mind was shielding this perception from me, so that I could continue to perpetrate this ruse. Why? Because the perception of our unity is so *overwhelmingly awesome* — in the original sense of the word — that I felt I didn't deserve it. How could one deserve Infinite Glory when they are such a fuck-up?

In that moment I recognized myself in literally everyone else. There *is* no one "else." It is just me — and it is you. I do not feel worthy of coming Home yet, and so I project my own darkness onto you, where I can viciously attack it, thereby reinforcing the same misperception in you, thus perpetuating the whole illusion. It is always the same trick. The only way *anyone* can cause harm is by shielding themselves from perceiving the *life* in their victims — be they other people, animals, or Nature herself. And by hating them for making this mistake, I am driving that tendency deeper *into* their minds.

Let us close the loop. Part of me *knows* it is shoving them deeper into the abyss, and yet I hide that knowledge from myself. 





It became clear that contempt — that seemingly-innocuous feeling of being *intrinsically superior* to others — contains within it the kernel of *all the evil there ever was.* It didn't matter whether my target was "good" or "bad": simply by feeling contempt, I was telegraphing my own inner darkness to them — but in a way that was hidden from my own conscious mind. I would tell myself that this attitude was there to brighten the world by subduing evil, but a tiny part of me secretly knew better.

The trick was astonishing. The knowledge of my wrongdoing existed in a kind of limbo state: I simultaneously *knew* yet somehow *didn't.* I saw that it is this same trick that the "bad people" use to do what *they* do. Part of them knows *perfectly well* that they are doing wrong, but this knowledge is carefully shielded from conscious self-reflection, so that they can honestly claim *not* to know. By engaging in this self-deception myself, I was driving the same tendency deeper *into* their minds where I could then viciously judge them for it.

Seeing this, I immediately felt its malevolence. This is hard to put into words. It was as though I could always see the Light hidden beneath the delusion in others — and by labeling them "bad," I could get away with smothering it in the name of "good." I could see that part of them actually didn't want to be infected by the darkness — but instead of assisting that part, I forsook it.


---
---

I was shown how this single act of self-deception contains within it the seed of *all the evil there ever was* — and how fixing this one mistake would have implications far beyond my individual life.
 
It was revealed that part of me always knew *perfectly well* what I was doing, even though I claimed not to know. I was somehow shielding this knowledge from my own conscious mind, creating a kind of paradoxical state in which I both *knew* and yet *didn't.* This gave me plausible deniability: consciously, I was flawlessly convinced that I was doing good — even as part of me secretly knew better.

Subconsciously, I had believed that since even *I* wasn't aware of this subterfuge, others surely couldn't tell. This is the hardest thing to explain. Not only could they tell that I was acting out of malice — even though I myself couldn't — but the darkness within me *wanted* them to know. That was how the whole trick worked. It was as though the darkness in my own mind was leaking out through my eyes and into theirs, offering *their* darkness a secret handshake.

I was shown how incredibly subtle this process could be. I didn't even need to use mockery or shame to achieve it. Simply by *harboring contempt* — the mere feeling that others were *fundamentally defective* or *inferior* to myself, my darkness would somehow, one way or another, always leak out into the world in ways that I would never consciously recognize. It would then come boomeranging back, in some form, thus compelling me to escalate my self-righteous wrath.

I saw that this was the mechanism by which evil sustained itself — each one of us convinced that we are the "good guys," valiantly fighting the hordes of evil; never realizing that this very attitude was the surest sign that we were already under the sway of humanity's ultimate nemesis.


---


I saw that my urge to violently punish wrongdoers was secretly an excuse to indulge my *own* dark fantasies — but that I was able to disguise this fact so well that even *I* didn't know it. At the conscious level, it felt impossibly righteous; yet part of me somehow knew that my behavior would only darken the world. But how could I possibly know such a thing?

I saw that this is precisely the same trick that *all* people use to commit evil: we hide knowledge of our wrongdoing from our own conscious minds. It requires a kind of mental schism; a bizarre state in which we simultaneously *know* and yet somehow *do not.*

I was shown that the reason we must hide such knowledge from ourselves is that there is always a part of us that wouldn't tolerate it if only it knew. This is true of everyone, from the greatest saint to the worst sinner. The only difference is in how deeply hidden this aspect is from our conscious minds.

When I treat other people with contempt — that is, the belief that they are *fundamentally* defective or inferior — I am secretly trying to push them *further* from their inner Light.


---

The urge to violently punish others is secretly a desire to distance them *further* from their inner Light. Why would I want to do this? Because the further they get, the more different they seem from me.

It turns out I ultimately *am* everyone and everything else, but I'm not ready to see this yet. So I find clever ways to hide it. The cleverest of all is to divide the world into the *fundamentally good* and *fundamentally bad*; those who deserve my compassion and those who deserve my contempt.

The secret purpose of contempt is to express evil in a way that appears unmistakably righteous. By simply harboring this dark tendency, I telegraph to my enemy that I'm under the sway of the very illusion that I'm viciously judging them for, thereby provoking them into behavior that will prove me right about them.

I *need* to believe that evil exists only outside myself. With this single belief in place, I will *necessarily* locate its source in other humans, perceiving them as *fundamentally defective,* so that my cruelty becomes not only justified but morally necessary.


---



This is the very *essence* of evil. My enemy subconsciously recognizes this




How can I know this? Because 


The urge to violently punish others is secretly a desire to distance them *further* from their inner Light — because the further they get from it, the easier it becomes to convince myself that they *have* none, and that therefore my cruelty is righteous, leading to an unvirtuous cycle. But it isn't cruelty for cruelty's sake; the true purpose of making others worse is to hide my own darkness from myself.

I am shoving other people deeper into the abyss to prove to myself that I am good — and astonishingly, the *mere unconscious desire* to do this is itself enough to accomplish it. Why? Because it telegraphs to them that I am under the sway of the very thing that I am viciously judging them for, thereby causing them to see *me* as evil, thus compelling them to double down.

But it is not truly *me* doing this. No: what I ultimately am is my inner Light. The Darkness acts *through* me, but it is not what I am. It is not what *any* of us are. Yet it manipulates my perception so that I see them this way, thereby tricking me into strengthening its grip on them while letting me feel righteous about it.

It is as though the Darkness in my mind and theirs are working together by making us feel like we are fighting each other.


---

When we witness another person causing harm, we see the part that knows very well what they're doing; yet they somehow only see the part that doesn't.

---
---

I saw that the reason I mock and shame my enemies is not *despite* the fact that it makes them dig in their heels, but *because* of it: the feeling of righteously punishing evil was so satisfying that I wanted more of it, which I could get by being cruel — and that by branding it as "fighting evil," I could not only get away with it but be praised for it by my allies, the "good people." The deeper I shoved the "bad people" into the abyss, the more of this dark pleasure I could access.

I was shown the tremendous harm this caused — not only to my targets, but to countless others down the line: an already-overworked father going home and taking his humiliation out on his wife and children, who would then grow up to be "bad people" themselves — and who I could then blame for the sorry state of the world, never recognizing my own complicity.

I saw that producing these results didn't even require overt cruelty: simply *feeling malice* was enough to induce subtle effects that I could then use to justify more self-serving behavior. In fact, even malice wasn't required; *contempt* was enough. Simply by perceiving myself as *intrinsically superior* to others; seeing them as *fundamentally defective,* the world would become darker.

I was shown the fiendish mechanism by which this works: by harboring contempt, I secretly telegraph to my enemy that I'm caught in the same dark trap I'm viciously judging them for, thereby provoking them into seeing me as evil for the same reason I see them that way. This helps them alleviate any guilt they might have otherwise felt for their misbehavior, which I can then use as proof that they are indeed fundamentally defective, thus licensing me to escalate.

I saw that this process required a kind of cooperation: it only worked when my target had some darkness to provoke — which, thankfully, essentially everybody did, whether they knew it or not. It was as though my darkness was reaching out to offer theirs a secret handshake. This took place beneath our conscious thresholds, so that we could remain bitter enemies on the surface, even as our darkness was secretly allied. I saw its true goal: complete dominion over our reality.

The hardest part was being shown that I somehow knew all this *even as I did it.* This is paradoxical and hard to describe. On one hand, I had *no idea* and would have been genuinely mortified to learn of my profound complicity in what is essentially the *ultimate evil conspiracy*. On the other hand, I was shown clearly that some part of me did, indeed know. Worst of all, this knowledge wasn't truly unconscious: it was *completely accessible* to consciousness if only I had chosen to look. But I had been *choosing not to look*.

This is the secret mechanism behind *all the evil there ever was*. The "bad people" know *perfectly well* that they are doing wrong, but this knowledge is carefully shielded from conscious self-reflection, so that in another sense, they really do *not* know. The reason I hate them for this is not because of how *different* I am, but how *similar*. By hating them, I can increase the apparent contrast between us, but only at the horrific price of hiding from myself the profound malevolence of my behavior. It requires a painful split of the psyche — one that my conscious mind does not recognize, yet which still drives the majority of my behavior.

This is where the "bad people" are stuck. Through some confluence of circumstances, they have found themselves in a Mariana's Trench of self-deception, into which almost no light may enter. They give my own darkness the perfect opportunity to manifest: here is someone who no sane person would dare defend. I can therefore shove them deeper into the abyss while also getting maximum credit for the "good" this creates. And all it requires is a bit of contempt.





*Nothing* feels better than being forced to unleash the full extent of my righteous fury.
