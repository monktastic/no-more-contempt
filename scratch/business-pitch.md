- Our hidden intentions have far-reaching consequences

If a politician is hungry for power and wealth, and starts a war, he will usually hide his intentions behind noble-sounding motives. But the war will still create a lot of needless suffering while enriching him. His hidden intentions were pulling the strings of the war machine he built.

The same is true when we build things. Our hidden drives find their ways into our products and into the world. And the more complex the machinery we build, the easier it is to slip those in.

- Self-deception

Now: did the politician know? This is the hardest thing to describe. The answer is yes and no. Part of him knew perfectly well, but the mind is able to shield knowledge of our misbehavior behind an impenetrable wall of reasonable-sounding justifications. This is self-deception.

We all know what this is like. Maybe not on that scale, but we have all overridden our conscience before. Part of us definitely knows, but it's very hard to get us to look that knowledge in the eye.

The upshot is that there are intentions that we hide even from ourselves that can still have major consequences.

- Contempt

When we watch a slimy politician in this state, we tend to feel contempt. And that contempt feels righteous; like it's there to help us fight their evil. But something much more interesting and insidious is actually going on.

Part of you knows that you have a tremendous capacity for self-deception. You subconsciously see something of yourself in his eyes. So your mind does something very clever. It treats him with cruelty.

Now, when you are in a state of self-deception, and someone tries to point it out in a nasty way, what happens? You see them as a bad person, because you subconsciously know that they can only do this from a place of self-deception. It inspires you to be nasty in return. It justifies and reinforces your self-deception. 

- Self-deception reinforces self-deception

So, back to the politician. Your mind knows that by treating him with contempt, he will see _you_ as someone worthy of contempt, which will convince him that what he is doing is righteous after all. And that recalcitrance will in turn convince you that what you are doing is righteous. Hopefully you see where this is going.

The takeaway is that my self-deception empowers your self-deception. When I act out my hidden agendas, I am secretly licensing you to do the same. And that's true whether you and I are friends or enemies on the surface of our minds. Our self-deception is always allied.

Most of our evil stems from behavior that we are fully convinced is righteous.

In fact, if you inspect your mind carefully enough, you will find that contempt and self-righteousness exist _only_ to shield yourself from the full implications of your words and behaviors. They license you to **elevate** or otherwise **enrich** yourself at the world's expense, because you see some people as okay to step on.

Now you might ask yourself, how am I enriching myself in the politician example? You are elevating yourself, helping yourself feel superior, by pushing his mind further into the abyss. You can actually feel this happening with people.

Of course, you're not usually in direct contact with politicians, but just by feeling contempt, you are encouraging those around you to feel the same. Some will join you in feeling it for your target, and it may eventually reach him. But others will feel it for you, because you are accusing their hero. In both cases, you get to feel superior while seeding darkness into the world.

- How to fight evil without contempt?

That's far too big a topic to cover here, but the short answer is that fighting evil can be motivated not by hatred, but by something else. I hesitate to use the word "love" here, because it sounds hippie, and also because that word doesn't come close to encompassing the enormity of the true answer.

There's much more to this quote, and it's far more nuanced. But there are these edge cases, where kindness doesn't look like what we conventionally expect.

- Ego

The mechanism that allows for self-deception is what the Buddhists know as the "ego." It operates at such a deep layer of mind that you won't notice it operating because it is building your experience of reality for you. You literally only see what it allows you to see. That's why it may be impossible to accept what I've just told you; that contempt for evil people is cleverly-disguised evil. 

You can't see this until your mind lets you. And that's what our training is about. There are techniques for undermining the ego; getting behind it.

And until we do that, every project that we start; every product that we build will be seeding our egoic motivations; our self-deception into the world without us realizing that this is happening.

- Addendum

The more you uncover your own ego, the more you discover a horrifying fact. Remember how I said that my self-deception empowers yours, whether you are a friend or foe?

Our egos are collaborating. In fact, they behave more like a single distributed entity that is always communicating with itself beneath our conscious thresholds. If you think of the ego as that devil on our shoulders, then this distributed malevolent entity is the Devil.

This is what we are sensing when we fear that there's an evil conspiracy controlling the world. In a sense, there really is — and every one of us is secretly in on it. It is the primordial conspiracy; the one to which all the rest ultimately owe their existence, and to which they all ultimately report. And its greatest trick is to get you to empower it while flawlessly convinced that you're fighting it.

This is why the US may be headed toward civil war while everyone is convinced that it's either the fault of the other side, or of the elites who are pulling all of our strings. Both of those things may be true, and yet there is something much deeper going on. We all have a part to play.

This is what we are up against. It's what we've always been up against. And it's urgent that we realize this given the power that we now wield.
