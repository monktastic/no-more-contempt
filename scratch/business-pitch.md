When we ask ourselves "what can I do to best improve the world, in my work and personal life?", we usually find ourselves making comparisons or calculations. How do I eliminate the most disease or poverty, or remove the most carbon? But there's one question we're not asking ourselves that matters at least as much: "am I really _trying_ to help the world?"
