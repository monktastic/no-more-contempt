Looking at the state of the world, it's easy to believe there's an *evil global conspiracy* secretly pulling the strings. In a sense, there actually is—and our world will not be healed until we bring it down. All the cleverness in the world cannot save us as long as it's being usurped by a foe we can scarcely comprehend.

Think back to how it feels to mock and shame your enemies—the *bad people*. It feels like you're valiantly fighting evil; yet it only tends to make them dig in their heels. Why? The obvious answer is that they're *bad people*—so of course they would. But if you look a little closer, you'll find that something in you secretly *wanted* them to, so that you could prove yourself right about them. 


It doesn't take much to accomplish this. By simply injecting a bit of malice or contempt, you can bring out more darkness in your enemies while giving yourself plausible deniability about your true intentions.



This malice may suppress your enemy's misbehavior—in public, anyway, and for a time—but their minds have been made *darker* in the process, and so has yours.

Think back to a time when you skirted your conscience—that is, acted in a way that went against your own deepest values while pretending it was okay. We've all done this. In that state, part of you knew *perfectly well* that you were doing wrong, but this knowledge was carefully shielded from conscious awareness, so that you could convincingly pretend not to know—*even to yourself*.

There is something within us that enables self-serving behavior while hiding or minimizing the harm it causes—and more insidiously, it hides its own existence from our minds. It is the very same thing that enables corrupt politicians to wage unjust wars and greedy CEOs to plunder nature for profit. Not just the same *kind* of thing, mind you, but the same *actual* thing.

There is but a single darkness acting through all of us. It hides itself perfectly from our own minds—so that we don't realize we're infected—while making us perceive it as *intrinsic* to others, so that we see them as inherently evil. We thus feel *contempt* for them, certain that this helps—but all it actually does is signal that we're under the sway of the very sickness we're judging them for, thereby convincing them that *we* are evil, helping them feel even more justified. This in turn gives us further proof that we were right about them, thus compelling us to escalate.

The darkness cleverly *orchestrated* this ruse, to entrench itself more deeply in both minds while leaving us more confident that we're free of it. Going forward, we will be *less* likely to detect its insidious presence within ourselves, being far more concerned with the *actual* evil out there. Behaviors that we would normally recognize as self-serving suddenly become justified or even noble, and no matter how hard anyone tries to point out our deception, we will be unable to see it—until eventually, they are forced to treat us with contempt, thus beginning the cycle anew.



The more we recognize and heal its dark presence within ourselves, the less contempt we are able to feel for anyone—both because we recognize how malicious it is, and because we finally begin to appreciate just how

It's impossible to overstate just how much human activity takes place from within this state. By its very nature, we never realize when we are in it. Yet it is responsible for *all the evil there ever was,* from the tiniest act of unkindness to the most horrific atrocity ever committed—and every time any one of us engages in it, we lower the threshold for others to do the same.

Perhaps the most surprising example is this: when we mock and shame our enemies for "being evil," part of us knows that this will only make them see *us* as evil, leaving them feeling *more* justified. We tell ourselves this is an unfortunate outcome, but hardly surprising given how *bad* they are. Alas, we are forced to escalate. But what actually happened is that the darkness in our mind secretly telegraphed itself to them specifically to produce this outcome.

The darkness is playing us for fools. It orchestrated this interaction in order to further colonize both of our minds while leaving us feeling more convinced that we are *free* of it. Going forward, we will both be *less* likely to notice how our own behavior is darkening the world—because why worry about what's going on *in here* when there's *real* evil that must be defeated *out there*?

It is an *impossibly* clever ruse. Simply by *feeling contempt*—that is, the sense that you are *intrinsically* superior to other people along any dimension, including morality—you will license yourself to engage in some kind of self-serving behavior that you will be unable to recognize as such; and this behavior will tacitly license others to do the same, one way or another.

The more you uncover and heal this dark pattern in yourself, the more you discover a horrifying truth:

It is this mechanism that has enabled *all the evil there ever was,* from the tiniest unkindness to the most horrific atrocity ever committed—and every time any one of us engages in it, we lower the threshold for others to do the same.

We tell ourselves that our own examples are *fundamentally different* from those of the "bad people"—who we are therefore entitled to treat with contempt—but this *itself* is profound self-deception. Deep down we *know* that we are not intrinsically superior to anyone—the "bad people" included—and so by pretending that we are, we give ourselves away.

This is why our enemies dig in their heels when we mock and shame them. It's not the mockery or shaming alone that cause it, but the *contempt* with which we almost always infuse them. It is a dead giveaway that we're lost in the very thing we're contemptuously judging *them* for—and no matter how well we try to hide this fact, our enemy still senses it, helping them feel more justified in theirs.

The key word is "helping." The darkness in our mind *telegraphed* itself to them specifically to provoke this response, because it knew how theirs would react. That's because all the darkness in the world is fundamentally identical. It tricks us into fighting our enemies in ways that *reinforce* it in both of us, even as we're increasingly convinced that we're *free* of it. We will increasingly overlook its presence in our own minds, convinced that it only exists "out there."

This is the trap in which all of humanity is caught. Every one of us uses the sorry state of the world to license *some* kind of self-serving behavior of our own that we do not recognize as such, because it is somehow justified or necessary—not realizing that we are deceiving ourselves, and that this deception only further darkens the world, which we then use to justify *more.*

Crucially: we don't do this because we are *bad people.* What we think of as "evil" is more like a mind-virus. 




The *vast majority* of human activity takes place from within this state. By its very nature, we never realize when we are in it—but this doesn't stop *other* people from recognizing it, at least subconsciously; and it gives them tacit permission to do it too.

We mock and shame our enemies for being "bad people," but part of us knows that we're not *intrinsically* superior to them; that they're only acting from a self-deception that we ourselves share. But we convincingly pretend *not* to know—*even to ourselves*—and this itself alerts them to the fact that we're engaged in the very thing we're contemptuously judging them for, thus helping them feel *more* justified in their behavior.

The world has been made darker even as each party feels more justified. Both will therefore be *less* likely to notice the darkness infiltrating deeper into their minds.


Contempt for other people is *malicious,* no matter who they are or what they've done—but we've hidden this knowledge so well that we believe we've somehow rendered it untrue. We think there are exceptions—places where our enemies are so bad that the usual rules no longer apply. We somehow can't see that this belief exists only for our darkness to justify itself to us, and that it only ever ends up creating more.

Have you ever suspected that there's an *evil global conspiracy* secretly running the world from the shadows? In a sense, there actually is. The reason it's so hard to expose is that none of us ever believe it even when it's pointed out. Let me try to show you why.

Think back to a time when you mocked or shamed an enemy. They probably just dug in their heels, feeling even *more* convinced that they were right. Why?

Most likely, you believe it's because they're a *bad person.* How *else* would you expect such a person to react? But if you look more carefully—and this is *hard*—you'll discover that something in you not only knew this would happen, but secretly intended it. Why? Because it gives you further proof that they are indeed beyond help, thus licensing you to escalate. Going forward, you will be less likely to introspect on how your own behavior may be darkening the world, because you already have an irrefutable explanation for why things are so bad: it's because of all the *bad people.*

The truth is that people are only ever able to cause harm by hiding knowledge of its wrongness from their conscious minds in *exactly* this way—and by contemptuously judging them for it, you are only driving that capacity deeper *into* their minds. That's because contempt for people is an unmistakable sign that *you yourself* are engaged in self-deception, and so they can sense your hypocrisy. Indeed, something in you is ensuring that they do.

Mockery and shame alone aren't the cause. Wielded with wisdom, they can probably be used for good. But something in you knew that if you just infused them with a certain sharpness—that feeling of "you're *defective*" or "I'm better than you"—then you would *appear* to be doing good even as your behavior made the world darker. Crucially, nobody can *prove* that you acted maliciously—including yourself—and yet it will, indeed, darken the world one way or another.

That darkness doesn't just evaporate or stay localized. It works its way through your reality, passing from one mind to another; shapeshifting; merging with everyone else's; until eventually, it erupts in the form of genuine atrocities—events distant enough in time and space that you will feel absolutely no connection to them, thus licensing you to feel even *more* contempt for the "evil perpetrators." But part of you will always know the truth.

Deep down, you know that you are not *intrinsically* superior to anyone—the "bad people" included—but this is painful to admit, so you hide it from yourself at any cost. This knowledge is shielded so well that as far as you can tell, you do *not* know it: there really are people who are *intrinsically* defective and thus inferior to you. The problem is, as long as you believe this, you will license yourself to engage in *some* kind of harmful or self-serving behavior that you will be unable to recognize as such, and which will encourage others to do the same.

Have you ever suspected that there's an *evil global conspiracy* secretly running the world from the shadows? In a certain sense, there actually is — but it's not the one you may be thinking of.

Think back to a time when you skirted your own conscience — that is, behaved in a way that went against your own deepest values, yet convinced yourself that it was okay. Every one of us has done this, though we may not realize it. It requires a profound form of self-deception: part of us knows *perfectly well* that we're doing wrong, but this knowledge is carefully shielded from conscious self-reflection, so that it doesn't *feel* wrong. All we consciously hear are our own clever justifications.

It's impossible to overstate just how much human activity falls into this category. The examples we're aware of are only the very tip of the iceberg; by its very nature, the vast majority of our self-deception goes completely unnoticed — but that doesn't mean it has no effect.

Every time any one of us engages in such self-deception — no matter how subtle — we secretly license others to do the same.
