What does it mean to have compassion for evildoers? It has nothing to do with being nice, or gentle, or tolerant, or even understanding per se. Instead, it has to do with the following fact: contempt—the opposite of compassion—only ever *increases* the darkness in the world, because that is what it is secretly *meant* to do.

The only time we ever feel contempt for another person—the sense that we're *fundamentally superior* to them—is when our mind is shielding us from noticing some kind of harmful or self-serving behavior of our own. A deep part of us knows this, but we hide this fact from ourselves, hoping that our enemy won't notice our hypocrisy. But it turns out they always notice—if only subconsciously—because something in our mind *wants* them to. Why?

By revealing to them that we're hiding our own darkness from ourselves, we're letting them know that we're caught in exactly the trap that we're viciously judging *them* for. We know this will cause them to see us as hypocrites, thus helping them feel more justified in their behavior—which we can then judge them for, thereby licensing us to treat them with even more contempt.

In other words: contempt is how our darkness telegraphs itself to others while hiding itself from us, thereby provoking them into perceiving *us* as evil, which we can then use as evidence that *they* are—because why *else* would someone accuse us of such a ridiculous thing? But it turns out that evil is *nothing but* this ability to hide things from our own minds—and so in that sense, they are right.

A mind that is free of the capacity for self-deception simply cannot behave in harmful or self-serving ways. Why? Because what you are in your deepest nature is pure compassion—the intention to be of service to all of Life. This is not something soft or gentle—or at least not exclusively so. Genuine compassion can be as fierce or even violent as the situation warrants.

In other words: contempt is how the darkness in our own minds telegraphs itself to our enemies in order to provoke theirs—knowing that by doing so, it will reinforce itself in both of our minds while leaving us more confident that we are *free* of it. We will be less likely to notice its insidious presence *in here* because we'll be increasingly obsessed with the *real* threat out there.

Nearly all of us use some aspect of the evil "out there" to justify some kind of self-serving behavior of our own

Why do wise people urge compassion for evildoers? Are they being naive, or might they see something that we don't?

We often equate compassion with being nice, or gentle, or tolerant, or understanding; but that's a misconception — and a *motivated* one, at that. After all, there are certainly times when being nice would be harmful — such as when confronting evil. We therefore convince ourselves that *compassion* would be wrong in such circumstances.

We then close off our hearts; turning cruel, or at least coldly callous. We tell ourselves that we're acting for "the greater good" — but the truth is that part of us knows that our behavior will only *increase* the net animosity in the world. In fact, not only do we *know* this, but part of us secretly *intends* it.

Why? Humans are masters of self-deception. Think back to a time when you skirted your own conscience; pretending either that you couldn't hear it or that you didn't have to listen. Part of you knew *perfectly well* that you were doing wrong, but that knowledge was carefully shielded from conscious self-reflection, so that it didn't *feel* wrong. All you could hear were your own clever justifications.

It is a bizarre state of mind; one in which we simultaneously *know* yet somehow do *not* — and we employ it far more often than we realize. The examples we're aware of are only the very tip of the iceberg. The vast majority remain hidden from our conscious minds.

It is this mechanism that is responsible for *all the evil there ever was,* from the tiniest act of unkindness to the greatest atrocity ever committed. Part of us *knows* that "bad people" can only do what they do thanks to this capacity that we ourselves are still highly susceptible to.

It is impossible to make the world a better place by closing off your own heart. What do I mean by "closing off your heart"?

Consider how it feels to mock, shame, and contemptuously judge your enemies — the bad people. It feels *impossibly righteous,* doesn't it? Yet if you look closely enough, you'll discover that something in you secretly knows that this is only liable to make them dig in their heels, convinced that *you* are evil.

It is an *insanely* clever ruse. No matter how well you try to hide it, your contempt — that feeling of being *intrinsically superior* to others, or seeing them as *fundamentally defective* — powerfully telegraphs to them the darkness within yourself. This conveys to them that *darkness is the way.*

You may not *think* you have any "darkness" within you — but that's exactly how it works. "Bad people" don't know when they're doing wrong — or rather, part of them knows *perfectly well,* but this knowledge is carefully shielded from conscious self-reflection, so that it doesn't *feel* wrong. All they consciously hear are their own clever justifications.

If you've ever skirted your own conscience — and who of us hasn't — then you know this state intimately well yourself. Try and recall what it is like. It is a bizarre schism of mind, in which you simultaneously *know* and yet somehow *dont.* What we don't realize is just how often we engage in it. Our minds are continually seeking ways to gain an edge for ourselves at the world's expense.

If we were to confront the full depths of our own complicity in the world's horrors, we would be totally overwhelmed. So instead, we viciously attack the darkness in others, pretending to be fighting it — not realizing that this just *reinforces* it. But again, part of us *does* realize it — so we must suppress this knowledge too, until the whole mass of self-deception collapses in on itself like a black hole.

If you've ever suspected that there is an *evil global conspiracy* secretly running the world from behind the scenes, this is what you are feeling. The aggregate self-deception of humanity has taken on a life of its own, behaving more like a *singular malevolent distributed entity.* The "evil" you see in one person's eyes is the very same entity you see in any other's — and also the same one that you display to the world whenever you feel *contempt*.

*Kind* is the hardest word to define, but also the most important. We may think it means being nice, or gentle, or tolerant, or understanding, but these are misconceptions — and motivated ones, at that. You see, there are situations where it makes no sense to be nice — such as when confronting evil — and so we tell ourselves that we need not be *kind.* We then close off our hearts, convinced that what the world really needs is a bit of our own darkness.

The truth is, there is no way to make the world better by withholding your love from it.

What is the difference between _kind_ and _nice_?

Nice is about being pleasant and agreeable. Those are generally good qualities, but obviously bad in some situations — for example, when confronting malicious behavior.

Kindness, on the other hand, is _never_ wrong.

It is remembering that the deepest part of you only wants what is best for the world. Astonishingly, the more deeply you see this about yourself, the more you see it in everyone else — including the people you normally think of as "evil." This isn't just a belief, but an actual _perception._

We normally cannot perceive this, because there's an aspect of our mind — what the Buddhists know as the _ego_ — that actively shields it from us. It makes us see some people as _fundamentally defective_, and thus worthy of harm. For those of us with a self-image as "good people," these are the "bad people." (And for some "bad people," it might be nearly everyone.)

What we do not see is that even _they_ could not do what they do if not for the influence of the ego — and treating them with contempt just exacerbates the problem. We can't see this because we're getting something from it: the darker we make their minds, the more superior we get to feel. If we were to admit this to ourselves, our whole world would shatter, as we realized that we're not so special after all. Our egos _cannot_ let that happen.

Kindness is the recognition that nearly the whole world is trapped in this sordid game of shoving each other into the abyss while patting ourselves on the back for it — and refusing to play that game, because there is a much more beautiful game to be played. It's one that _frees_ others from their inner demons instead of feeding them to it.

It has nothing to do with being _nice._ There is no specific form that kindness must take. It may have to be fierce, or even violent. It may even appear egoic on the surface, by utilizing shame, mockery, or even apparent contempt. But underneath the surface, something else is happening — and this makes _all the difference in the world._

I can't describe what that "something else" is, but part of you already knows it. It's similar to remembering that "hurt people hurt people" — but infinitely deeper, covering even the cases where you normally can't perceive the "hurt" or are unwilling to believe that one even exists.
