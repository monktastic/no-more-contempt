What is the difference between _kind_ and _nice_?

Nice is about being pleasant and agreeable. Those are generally good qualities, but obviously bad in some situations — for example, when confronting malicious behavior.

Kindness, on the other hand, is _never_ wrong.

It is remembering that the deepest part of you only wants what is best for the world. Astonishingly, the more deeply you see this about yourself, the more you see it in everyone else — including the people you normally think of as "evil." This isn't just a belief, but an actual _perception._

We normally cannot perceive this, because there's an aspect of our mind — what the Buddhists know as the _ego_ — that actively shields it from us. It makes us see some people as _fundamentally defective_, and thus worthy of harm. For those of us with a self-image as "good people," these are the "bad people." (And for some "bad people," it might be nearly everyone.)

What we do not see is that even _they_ could not do what they do if not for the influence of the ego — and treating them with contempt just exacerbates the problem. We can't see this because we're getting something from it: the darker we make their minds, the more superior we get to feel. If we were to admit this to ourselves, our whole world would shatter, as we realized that we're not so special after all. Our egos _cannot_ let that happen.

Kindness is the recognition that nearly the whole world is trapped in this sordid game of shoving each other into the abyss while patting ourselves on the back for it — and refusing to play that game, because there is a much more beautiful game to be played. It's one that _frees_ others from their inner demons instead of feeding them to it.

It has nothing to do with being _nice._ There is no specific form that kindness must take. It may have to be fierce, or even violent. It may even appear egoic on the surface, by utilizing shame, mockery, or even apparent contempt. But underneath the surface, something else is happening — and this makes _all the difference in the world._

I can't describe what that "something else" is, but part of you already knows it. It's similar to remembering that "hurt people hurt people" — but infinitely deeper, covering even the cases where you normally can't perceive the "hurt" or are unwilling to believe that one even exists.
