There's a crucial insight about our minds and the nature of evil that I think we're missing as a civilization, and it's one that psychedelics are uniquely powerful at inducing.

Wise people throughout history have urged compassion for evildoers. Most of us have a vague understanding of why, but it's hard to exactly put our finger on. Therefore, when we're actually confronted with evil, we often respond in a way that just creates more.

The prototypical example is the "War on Terror." Didn't the people in charge know that indiscriminately bombing strangers would just create _more_ enemies that they would then be forced to bomb even harder?

The cynical take is that yes, they knew this, and it's what they secretly wanted, because it gets them more power and money. But is it possible that in their minds, they really thought that they were doing a good thing?

The answer is yes and no. Part of them knew perfectly well that what they were doing would be a net harm to the world, but that knowledge — or its visceral wrongness — was carefully shielded from conscious self-reflection to make their behavior congruent with their self-image.

We can practically see the self-deception in their eyes. And how does that make us feel? It probably makes us feel _contempt._ Now for the kicker.

Any time we feel contempt for a person, our mind is secretly entering that same dark space in which self-deception thrives. It compels us to behave in ways that will elevate or otherwise enrich us at the world's expense while also providing us with plausible deniability.

We perceive our enemies as fundamentally morally defective so that we feel no compunction in being cruel. We mock and shame them, because what else can you do with a broken person? This may suppress their misbehavior (in public, anyway), for which we pat ourselves on the back. But it leaves them feeling _more_ justified in whatever storyline was driving their misbehavior in the first place.

Their increased self-deception will manifest in some form or another, by which point we will have washed our hands of all complicity. We've created more evil, and deep down we know it. In fact, we wanted it, because now we are even more justified in unleashing our righteous fury.

But we cannot consciously admit this for exactly the same reason that the politicians couldn't acknowledge what _they_ were doing.

There's a mechanism in our minds that actively shields us from confronting the full implications of our words and actions. And when we give in to this mechanism, we empower those around us to do the same.

When I mock you, you subconsciously sense that I am lost in self-deception, which triggers your desire to put me in my place, which is what I use to license escalation. The whole thing is choreographed.

The choreographer is what the Buddhists call the ego, and it is also commonly depicted as the devil on our shoulders. That image is almost accurate, except for two things. First, the devil is not actually intrinsic to our minds. It is a kind of parasite. Second, the angel represents our true nature as compassion. It _is_ intrinsic, as we will see later.

The devil doesn't just whisper obviously-evil ideas in my ear. It pretends to be my angel; to be me. And it alters my very perception, so that you appear fundamentally defective. This way, I will behave in a way that empowers your devil. It is like a secret handshake between my devil and yours. You and I may be enemies, but our devils are always allies.

In fact, our devils aren't truly separate. They are more like outgrowths of a single distributed malevolent entity that is continually manipulating _all_ of our minds — the _Devil_, if you will. It is this Devil that is driving the US toward a civil war in which most of us are unaware of our own complicity.

It is said that the elites are playing us regular people off of each other to take attention off of themselves. This may well be true, but what we don't see is that something far more insidious is playing us off the elites by making us hate them. And this something lives within our own minds.

Every time we feel malice, contempt, or even self-righteousness toward anyone for any reason; every time we are unkind, we are empowering the Beast. It is as though we are all members of the primordial "evil conspiracy"; the one to which all the rest ultimately owe their existence. And part of us has always known this.

If we were suddenly forced to confront the full depths of our complicity in the horrors of the world, it would drive us insane. It must be done with extreme skill and compassion. Enter psychedelics.

Here's a question and answer from a forum I once stumbled upon.

[Mushroom quote - 338 words]

It is only once we have seen this about ourselves that we begin to understand what compassion truly means.

Nobody ultimately _wants_ to be under the sway of their devil. This includes the people who say that they do; the people whom we classically think of as "evil." They are suffering from a kind of Stockholm Syndrome, and hating them just exacerbates it.

Compassion doesn't mean being _nice_ to them. Sometimes, that doesn't work. It means being able to perceive the aspect of their mind that wants to be free of their parasitic demon, and empowering it. It means giving up your own self-deception; your ego.

There is no specific form that compassion must take. It may require a kind of tough love, which can be fierce or even violent on the surface. It may take the form of mockery, shame, or even apparent contempt.

But something very different is happening beneath the surface. Their subconscious can sense whether you are acting from self-deception or not. Before, you were, and this just reinforced theirs. Now, you are not, and it weakens theirs. This is true even if you were forced to use violence.

It is as though their devil is searching your mind carefully for any sign of your devil to complete the secret handshake, but it cannot find even a trace of it. Instead, it runs into your angel, which subdues it.

The aspect of their mind that wants to be free begins to awaken. And it sees that it has a partner in the fight; that rare person who won't just smother its cries for help for his own selfish ends. On the surface, the two of you may still be enemies, but your inner Light is always allied.

To be clear, compassion does not always tell you what the most effective behavior is. That requires wisdom, which is a separate but related skill. Compassion just ensures that you are acting in accordance with your deepest values; that you are not falling victim to your own self-deception. This should be considered table stakes for humanity. Agreeing on the details of proper behavior becomes infinitely easier from this place.

Psychedelics can reveal to you the full, horrifying depths of your own self-deception, while also cushioning it with the realization that the very deepest, truest part of you doesn't want to be doing it. It is only then that you begin to perceive — not just believe, but perceive — the sense in which nobody else does, either.

Before seeing this (in one way or another), we are only capable of reinforcing the evil that exists out there, even as we're flawlessly confident that we're helping. We're liable to head down the dark path that has historically led to genocides, even when — or, especially when — we believe ourselves immune. You cannot fathom how clever your ego really is.

The ultimate root of self-deception is the illusion that you and I are separate to begin with. Reality is actually one seamless interconnected whole, and anything I do to harm it ultimately harms myself. Contemptuously judging other people for not realizing this is itself just another form of this.

Seeing this in its entirety is what the Buddhists know as _enlightenment._ It is purportedly impossible to describe, but I'll link some literature that I think captures some of the taste.

Our true enemy is not actually other people. It is the powerful darkness that has captivated our minds. We each have a role to play in dispelling it, and it begins with ourselves. This is what we must remember if we are to survive.
