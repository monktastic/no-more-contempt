Consider the "bad people" of the world — the murderers, rapists, child abusers; the greedy bankers, hypocritical CEOs, corrupt politicians, etc. How are they able to do what they do without compunction? Have you ever felt the urge to violently punish them?

If you look carefully enough into your mind while feeling this way, you'll discover that part of you is secretly trying to *get away with* something. With what, exactly? With indulging your dark side in a way that you can frame as righteous.

It can be *extremely* difficult to admit this.
