What would it be like to experience the lives of everyone who ever lived? All their joys, miseries, accomplishments, failures, virtues, and vices? It would be quite something, wouldn't it? Far too big to fit inside a single human mind. If you had to distill it into something manageable; something that would summarize it all and serve to remind you, a lone individual, of the enormity of it all, you could hardly do better than this: _empathy._

Imagine, for a moment, that what the Buddhists say is true: that there is some profound sense in which you are fundamentally the same as everyone else. What would it be like to see this?

For one, you would no longer be able to feel contempt or malice. The illusion that you are in some way _intrinsically_ better than other people would evaporate. You would discover that people are only able to misbehave because they have not yet seen _their_ fundamental unity yet. You couldn't hate them for this — even though you may still have to use _anger_ or even _violence_ to fight them.

You would see that all forms of unkindness — which is to say, _maliciousness_ — are secretly tools to re

Consider how your own misbehavior works. It requires a kind of self-deception: you _know_ that what you're doing is wrong, but you _hide_ that knowledge from yourself in a way that makes it feel okay. You would suddenly see that this is how _all_ evil ultimately works, and so it makes _zero_ sense to feel contempt or malice for evildoers — even if you must still use anger or violence to subdue them.

In fact, you would see that those feelings are _themselves_ profoundly self-deceptive: they exist only to make it _harder_ for you and others to notice your fundamental sameness, which then triggers even more malice in contempt in everyone, in a powerfully seductive feedback loop. You would realize that you appear evil to others while feeling them, for _precisely_ the same reason that others appear evil to you now. Contempt is the very _essence_ of evil — _regardless of who it is directed at._

This field of self-deception radiates rapidly outward, deranging every mind that it touches. Each person feels confident that their hatred is contributing something _good_ to the world, not realizing that their enemies are caught in exactly the same trap, with everyone secretly allied in evil.

There are many such fields interacting right now, like waves in a pool, but with much more complex dynamics. If you could perceive this sinister blob clearly, you could be forgiven for confusing it with the biblical Satan — because that is _exactly_ how it behaves. Every "evil conspiracy" ultimately draws its power from this malevolent "entity" — one that we are all continually feeding.

> _And no wonder, for even Satan masquerades as an angel of light. So it is not strange that his ministers also masquerade as ministers of righteousness._ —2 Corinthians 11:14-16

Every time any one of us feels contempt, malice, hatred, or even self-righteousness; every time we perceive others as beneath us; we are feeding the Beast. They are not required to fight evil; they only *strengthen* it. Whether you are a Buddhist, Christian, atheist, or none of the above, you can learn to perceive this clearly. In fact, as far as I can tell, everyone who introspects carefully enough eventually does.

The more clearly you see it, the more deeply you realize that there is nothing special about you that enabled you to resist its powerful seduction where others failed. In fact, the more "special" you feel, the more certainly you are already in its powerful grip: for _it_ is precisely what enables you to see yourself as _fundamentally superior_ to others — who therefore deserve your contempt.

The greatest gift you can give the world is to inoculate yourself against the "Devil." You cannot do this by seeing yourself as a "good person", for then you cannot help but see (fundamentally) "bad" people — which is precisely how the evil gets in. You can only do it by discovering the most fundamental aspect of your mind; one which we all (surprisingly) share; which is _intrinsically_ good.

We don't hate bad people because of how different they are; we hate them because the deepest part of us sees our similarity, which we then do everything in our power to hide. Our contempt exists to push them further into delusion, so that both of us can avoid seeing our similarity for as long as possible. This is the game that the whole world is trapped in, and we _must_ stop.

This is all supposedly only seen fully upon enlightenment, but we can all see it to some degree or another at all times. That's why certain literature speaks to us so powerfully.
