When we think about the people responsible for what's wrong with the world — the "bad people" — we tend to feel _contempt_. Such people don't merely have worse ideas or behavior than us; they seem somehow _fundamentally morally defective_, and thus completely unlike us.

It feels like this contempt exists to help us fight evil, but something much darker is actually going on beneath the surface: if you introspect closely enough, you'll find that contempt exists only to make us behave in ways that will provoke people into _proving_ what bad people they are, so that we can feel justified in our contempt.

Something deep within us knows that there's no _intrinsic_ difference between us and them; that we ourselves are capable of almost anything under the right circumstances. Our subconscious uses contempt to help this fact stay hidden from consciousness. It does its job well, which is why you may not believe me when I say that you already know this.

Consider what happens when we mock our political opponents. Don't they just dig in their heels, see _us_ as evil, and vow to fight harder? We tell ourselves that we had "good intentions" (to shut them up; force them to introspect; convince others not to join them, etc.), but the truth is that something in us is _trying_ to maintain the polarization.

This ultimately harms the world, and part of us knows it. But "good people" don't act that way, and so we must hide this fact from consciousness. This is precisely what the "bad people" are doing: part of them knows perfectly well when what they're doing is wrong, but the _wrongness_ is carefully hidden from conscious self-reflection.
