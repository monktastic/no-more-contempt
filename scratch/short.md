Humans are masters of self-deception. We often engage in self-serving behaviors that we disguise as righteous. We give ourselves special privileges, employ "ends justify the means" reasoning, etc. It's obvious that if people did less of this, the world would be a much better place. But there's one small problem.

Consider the people who are the worst examples of this — the greedy bankers, hypocritical CEOs, corrupt politicians and all who support them. Do you feel *contempt* — the sense that they are *intrinsically morally defective,* and fundamentally unlike yourself? If you look carefully enough — and this is hard — you'll discover that this feeling is itself profound self-deception.

Part of us knows that we're not *fundamentally* superior to anyone, but we hide this fact from ourselves by feeling contempt. What we don't see — at least, consciously — is that this secretly telegraphs to them that we're under the sway of the very illusion that we're viciously judging *them* for. That makes them see *us* as slightly evil, allowing them to feel *more* justified in their misbehavior.

The hardest thing to communicate is that part of us sees this, too. We *know* that our contempt is secretly designed to shove others deeper into the abyss in a way that appears righteous. But if we were to consciously acknowledge this, then we would also recognize that we are indeed not fundamentally superior to our enemies — and thus that our cruelty toward them

The self-deception that the "bad people" employ (ends justify the means reasoning, giving themselves special privileges, etc.) is precisely the same phenomenon that we use to hate them for it.

What's self-deceptive about hating bad people? If you look carefully enough into your mind while feeling this way, you'll discover that something in you knows that you're not fundamentally superior to them — or to anyone. This is extremely difficult to admit, for exactly the same reason that they cannot recognize their own self-deception.

The more you confront this clearly and directly in yourself, the more you discover an astonishing fact: your willingness to engage in such self-deception actually *reinforces* that same tendency in them. In fact, the whole *reason* that you engage in hatred of "bad people" is to reinforce their badness, so that you always have something to hate.

A simple example is how we mock and shame our enemies. Part of us knows that they will just dig in their heels, but we secretly want them to, because it proves just how bad they are. This gives us plausible deniability to escalate — our true goal, whether we realize it or not.

What's the purpose of all this? To better hide our own self-deception from ourselves. Any time we feel contempt for another being, what's really happening is that we're hiding the self-serving aspects of our own agendas and behaviors from ourselves. But it never *feels* like that, does it? No, it feels impossibly righteous. This is the trick by which the darkness hides from our minds.

It is impossible to overstate just how much of our present crises have their origin in such self-deception. We're focused on the mechanics of *how* to make the world better, but without seeing how every such mechanism is trivially and effortlessly co-opted by our dark sides without our conscious awareness, all of that effort will be for naught — or far worse.

This is why we cannot *think* our way out of the mess. Even "bad people" *think* they are doing good. A deeper part of them *knows* that they are engaged in self-deception, but that part is not reachable by thought. There is "something else" within you that knows when you're not aligned with what most deeply matters. And amazingly, the more closely you do align, the more your efforts to "fight evil" actually succeed. You're no longer shoving people deeper into the abyss in the name of good, but somehow pulling them *out*.

The only reason that "bad people" need to employ self-deception in the first place is that part of them wouldn't tolerate their misbehavior if only it knew. The way to stop their evil (in a lasting way) is to expose them to that part of themselves — and the only way to do *that* without causing a mess is for you to rediscover that part of yourself.

Consider the "bad people" of the world — the murderers, the rapists, the child abusers; the greedy bankers, hypocritical CEOs, corrupt politicians, etc. Don't they seem *intrinsically* defective — as though the evil is somehow *inherent* to their very minds?

It turns out that the aspect of mind that makes you see yourself as *fundamentally* different from them is precisely the *same* aspect that enables them to do wrong in the first place — and simply by giving credence to it, you *strengthen* that same capacity in them.

This can be extremely difficult to admit — and it is precisely that difficulty that enables evil to spread itself in our world unchecked. Something in us *needs* to see ourselves as different and special, even if only from the "bad people." What we don't realize is that the only purpose of this belief is to shield us from seeing all the ways in which we ourselves cause harm.

It's not that "bad people" don't know that they're doing wrong, per se. Part of them knows *perfectly well* — but this knowledge is carefully shielded from conscious self-reflection, so that they can honestly claim not to. All they consciously hear are their own clever justifications. It is a paradoxical state of mind, in which they simultaneously know and yet somehow don't. It is the same trick that our own minds use to hide our own wrongdoing from ourselves.

Reflect on how it feels to mock and shame your enemies

Hitler famously believed that he was doing good — but is it possible that some part of him secretly knew better? It's obviously difficult to know for sure, but notice if there's a part of you that wants to believe that no part of him knew — that he was *intrinsically* morally defective, and therefore *fundamentally* unlike yourself.

Here's the hardest thing to admit: the aspect of our minds that enables us to see ourselves as fundamentally different from others is the same aspect that allowed Hitler to do what *he* did — and any time we give credence to this mistaken perception, we induce the same tendency in others. We thereby make it *more* likely that similar atrocities will be committed in the future.

Wise people urge compassion for evildoers, but what does this really mean?

When you perceive yourself as *fundamentally superior* to the "bad people," what you are really doing is provoking that same tendency in them, so that they will become *worse* people, whom you can then hate more.

Do you know that you're doing this? Yes and no. Part of you knows it *perfectly well,* but this knowledge is carefully shielded from conscious self-reflection, so that you can honestly claim *not* to know. All you hear are your own clever justifications. It is precisely the same trick that enables the "bad people" to do what *they* do.

There is something in your mind that *needs* you to divide the world into fundamentally good and bad people; those who deserve your compassion and those who deserve your contempt. Simply by making this distinction, you will provoke the "bad people" into seeing *you* as bad, which will reinforce your certainty that you are right about them. What is this "something" in your mind? It is precisely the *same* "something" that enables them to do wrong in the first place.

The only way anyone can cause harm is by shielding themselves from fully perceiving the *life* in their victims — be they other people, animals, or Nature at large. Do they know that they're doing this? Yes and no. In one sense, they know it *perfectly well* — but that knowledge is cleverly hidden from their conscious minds, so that in another sense, they really don't.

By hating them for it, you are *reinforcing* this split. Do you *know* that you're doing this? Yes and no. Part of you knows it *perfectly well,* but you hide it from yourself — because if you saw it, you would suddenly realize that all the unkindness you've ever perpetrated on *anyone* — even those who "deserve" it — comes from *exactly* the same mistake that the "bad people" are trapped in.

When we think about the people responsible for what's wrong with the world — the "bad people" — we tend to feel _contempt_. Such people don't merely have worse ideas or behavior than us; they seem somehow _fundamentally morally defective_, and thus completely unlike us.

It feels like this contempt exists to help us fight evil, but something much darker is actually going on beneath the surface: if you introspect closely enough, you'll find that contempt exists only to make us behave in ways that will provoke people into _proving_ what bad people they are, so that we can feel justified in our contempt.

Something deep within us knows that there's no _intrinsic_ difference between us and them; that we ourselves are capable of almost anything under the right circumstances. Our subconscious uses contempt to help this fact stay hidden from consciousness. It does its job well, which is why you may not believe me when I say that you already know this.

Consider what happens when we mock our political opponents. Don't they just dig in their heels, see _us_ as evil, and vow to fight harder? We tell ourselves that we had "good intentions" (to shut them up; force them to introspect; convince others not to join them, etc.), but the truth is that something in us is _trying_ to maintain the polarization.

This ultimately harms the world, and part of us knows it. But "good people" don't act that way, and so we must hide this fact from consciousness. This is precisely what the "bad people" are doing: part of them knows perfectly well when what they're doing is wrong, but the _wrongness_ is carefully hidden from conscious self-reflection.
