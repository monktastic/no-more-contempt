When we think about the people responsible for what's wrong with the world — the "bad people" — we tend to feel _contempt_. Such people don't merely have worse ideas or behavior than us; they seem somehow _fundamentally morally defective_, and thus completely unlike us.

It feels like this contempt exists to help us fight evil, but something much darker is actually going on beneath the surface: if you introspect closely enough, you'll find that contempt exists only to make us behave in ways that will provoke people into _proving_ what bad people they are, so that we can feel justified in our contempt.

Something deep within us knows that there's no _intrinsic_ difference between us and them; that we ourselves are capable of almost anything under the right circumstances. Our subconscious uses contempt to help this fact stay hidden from consciousness. It does its job well, which is why you may not believe me when I say that you already know this.

Consider what happens when we mock our political opponents. Don't they just dig in their heels, see _us_ as evil, and vow to fight harder? We tell ourselves that we had "good intentions" (to shut them up; force them to introspect; convince others not to join them, etc.), but the truth is that something in us is _trying_ to maintain the polarization.

This ultimately harms the world, and part of us knows it. But "good people" don't act that way, and so we must hide this fact from consciousness. This is precisely what the "bad people" are doing: part of them knows perfectly well when what they're doing is wrong, but the _wrongness_ is carefully hidden from conscious self-reflection.

Why do we enjoy mocking and shaming people who we perceive as evil or stupid? We tell ourselves that it's helpful, or just a bit of innocent fun, but part of us is secretly trying to _reinforce_ their evil so that we have something to mock and shame.

knows that they're likely to just dig in their heels — and that part of us secretly wants this, because it vindicates our perception of them and justifies our contempt. Something in us doesn't _want_ to see our enemies improve, and so it makes us behave in ways that provoke their darkness, while making us feel righteous about doing so.

This is just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to our self-deception. If we look carefully, we'll find that your mind does a million tiny things to gain an advantage for ourselves at the world's expense, in ways that go against our deepest values. But this is extremely painful to admit, so we bury this knowledge. Instead, we stay laser focused on the evils of other people, not realizing that they too are only able to do it because their minds are similarly hiding certain things from them.

Except that part of us _does_ realize this. It is only our darkness that makes us feel fundamentally superior to others, so that treating them with contempt feels not only okay, but positively righteous. The cumulative effect of billions of us doing this is a world that feels like it could only be explained by the existence of a secret group of especially-evil people conspiring against us, the noble many.

Make no mistake: such "evil" people and conspiracies really do exist, but their evil is ultimately enabled by exactly the same mechanism as ours, and our contempt for them has exactly the same effect that it has on anybody else. It merely intensifies it. The existence of such people is effectively _necessitated_ by the overwhelming momentum of our collective Shadow.

Our secret need to behave in subtly self-serving ways that are cleverly hidden from our conscious minds _accumulates_ in the body politic, coalescing in the form of atrocities and grand conspiracies whose true origins are hidden from our collective consciousness, so that we may use them as justification to pile on more.

This is the _shadow_ aspect of our minds, and it is far more insidious than we realize. It continually works against our own deepest values.

The "evil people" are those in whom the Shadow has accumulated most intensely. Part of them knows perfectly well what they are up to, but the full implications are cleverly hidden from conscious self-reflection. If you really want them to stop them, you must bring this self-deceptive activity to light — which is impossible while you're still under the sway of your own, because it is secretly designed to shame them in ways that encourage theirs to hide _better_. The more powerful a person's shadow, the freer you must be of your own to be of any use, because theirs is _especially_ good at provoking yours in ways that you cannot detect. Its primary trick is to make you see their evil as intrinsic, so that you will feel contempt — the surest sign that you are in your shadow.

In truth, there isn't actually an "our" darkness and "theirs"; there is only the one Darkness, behaving like a singular _malevolent distributed entity_, with control centers in each of our minds. Kindness is any activity that combats it, and unkindness is any that empowers it. Sometimes kindness must be violent, and unkindness sometimes looks sweet. It is impossible to know whether you are fighting or supporting evil simply by inspecting your thoughts. You must look carefully at the *quality of your mind* in that precise moment. With practice, you learn to detect the presence of the Shadow in ever-subtler ways.

The mythical battle of Good and Evil really is unfolding, all the time and everywhere. It just doesn't look the way we've been taught — because it is the _Shadow_ that is largely responsible for those teachings. It manifests as revenge fantasy films and "watch Karens get owned" YouTube videos; anything that provokes genuine contempt toward _anyone_ for _any reason._


It is _always_ the same trap, just dressed in different garb. Malice and self-righteousness are also unmistakable signs.

Every one of us skirts our conscience in small and not-so-small ways. Most of this activity is hidden from conscious self-reflection, so we have no idea how much we do it. The cumulative effect of billions of us doing this is a world that looks like it's run by a small group of especially evil people. Make no mistake: such people do exist, and they must be stopped. But what we can't see is that our combined "dark activity" effectively _necessitates_ their existence and perpetuates it — and not by accident.

The darkness in our minds and theirs aren't actually _fighting_ each other. They are secretly allied, behaving like a singular _distributed malevolent entity_ that hides itself from _all of us._ Yes, the "evil people" know they are being evil, but the full implications of their behavior are cleverly shielded from conscious self-reflection. A part of them does _not_ see what they're really doing — and it is precisely the same part in us that believes that hating them for it will somehow help. If you look carefully enough into this hatred, you will discover that your mind is secretly angling to gain some advantage for yourself at the world's expense, but in a way that gives it plausible deniability (for example, by using it to justify other conscience-skirting behaviors). It is completely inevitable.

**Kindness does not mean being nice.** It means being free of self-deception.

Sometimes it feels like the world is divided into _fundamentally good_ people (who occasionally slip up) and _fundamentally bad_ people (for whom evil is intrinsic). Wisdom traditions teach us that this is a false distinction, but that's a hard thing to prove. But we _can_ prove to ourselves that the only reason we believe in this distinction is to provide ourselves with people for whom contempt feels righteous.

If you look carefully enough into your mind while feeling contempt for _anybody_, you'll find that your mind is secretly attempting to darken the world in a way that seems righteous. This self-deception is _precisely_ the same mechanism that enables "bad people" to avoid confronting the full  implications of their misbehavior. Any time any one of us engages in it, we secretly license others to do the same, be they "allies" or "enemies."

There are few pleasures as deliciously satisfying as violently defeating evil. Pause and recall what that's like. Here's the rub: that pleasure exists only to shield you from what your mind is really doing.

Evil is a parasite, and it is _insanely_ clever. Its most insidious trick is to hide itself from the mind of its host while conspicuously displaying itself to others. This provokes us into viciously attacking them, unaware that this is _our_ darkness telegraphing itself to them while hiding itself from us, to provoke them into returning the favor, to justify our self-righteous anger and license delicious escalation. This is incredibly difficult to admit to ourselves, but it's not until we see exactly _why_ it is so difficult that we begin to appreciate what is really going on in the minds of "evil people." It's not that they don't know that they're doing wrong. Part of them certainly does, but the full implications of their behavior are very carefully shielded from conscious self-reflection, so that it doesn't _feel_ wrong. It is precisely the same mechanism that inspires us to hate, mock, and shame them in ways that darken the world for our secret benefit. This provides dark cover for countless other acts of self-deception that we aren't conscious of.

It is said that "the elites" are playing us all against other to take attention off of them, but the Darkness in all of our minds is playing a _much bigger game_.

It keeps us our attention fixated on the evil "out there," so that we never discover its true origin "in here." Make no mistake: there certainly is evil out there, and it is our duty to fight it. But doing so with our own darkness, no matter how mild, can only ever reinforce it. It is only your Light that fights it. This doesn't mean being _nice_; it means seeing evil for what it really is: a parasite. There is _always_ some reason that people feel the need to harbor it, and it is never as simple as "they're just evil." Putting yourself in their shoes doesn't mean sympathizing with them or tolerating their evil; it means gaining deep insight into how things could have gone so wrong. From this place, it is impossible to feel malice, contempt, or self-righteousness. There is only the powerful urge to _evict_ the darkness, whether that requires being sweet and gentle, or fierce (or even violent).

There really is a kind of "evil global conspiracy" running the world from behind the scenes, but it's not the one you're probably thinking of.

Every one of us engages in self-serving behaviors whose full implications are carefully hidden from conscious self-reflection. It may be hard to see, but even the greatest evil is a manifestation of this very same phenomenon. There is a _reason_ that this is hard to see: our minds hide it from us



It lives deep in the crevices of our minds, and every time any one of us feels malice, contempt, or self-righteousness toward _anyone_, we are secretly feeding it. You can think of this as a kind of allegory, but you can also learn to perceive it clearly and directly.

It is an extremely difficult and painful thing to admit to ourselves because

Any time you feel self-righteousness or contempt, it is your mind secretly trying to darken the minds of others so that you don't have to confront something in yourself. This makes the world worse.

Each of us has our own perspective on "what's wrong with the world." When we focus on the people responsible, we often feel contempt. We believe that it's there to help us fix the problem, but it's precisely the opposite: contempt is the fuel that powers the engine that encourages others to act in the self-deceptive ways that cause us to feel contempt in the first place.

**Part of us _knows_ that this is the secret purpose of our contempt.** Contempt is therefore _itself_ such an act of self-deception (that encourages others to feel contempt for *us*), whose **only purpose** is to enable us to feel _even more_ contempt. You don't even have to express it directly to your target; merely by harboring it, you ensure that it will somehow leak out into the world and accomplish its sinister goal. This results in a horrifying feedback loop, which all of humanity is trapped in.

This is not merely wild speculation. Everyone who introspects carefully enough eventually discovers it. Until you see the source in your own mind, you cannot understand the true cause of other people's misbehavior, and therefore cannot fix it. You can only encourage *more*. Their misbehavior is enabled (and hidden from their minds) by _precisely_ the same mechanism as your contempt. There is no greater gift you can give the world than healing whatever is causing it.
