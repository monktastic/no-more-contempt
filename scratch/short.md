[the difference between being lovingly shown something and hatefully.]
["Contempt is an _unloving_ way of exposing the truth. It feels like coercion, not invitation.]

---

Think back to a time when you skirted your conscience—acted against your own deepest values while pretending it was okay. In that moment, part of you knew _perfectly well_ that you were doing wrong, but you shielded that knowledge from conscious awareness, so that it didn't _feel_ wrong. All you could hear were your own clever justifications. Knowledge of your wrongdoing existed in a kind of limbo state, in which you simultaneously _knew_ and yet somehow _didn't._

It’s a hidden trick of the mind that lets us cause harm while feeling justified. But why do we have to hide it? What are we hiding it _from_, exactly? It's almost as if there's a deeper part of us—call it our inner Light—that wouldn't tolerate it, if only it knew.

Here's what I was shown: this limbo state—a kind of self-deception—is the secret mechanism behind *all the evil there ever was.* Even the worst person can only cause harm by shielding their minds from perceiving the _life_ in their victims—that spark that would remind them of themselves—using exactly the same trick.

Hating people for being evil feels righteous, but it only reinforces their capacity for self-deception—that is, makes them *more* evil.

Let's start with a much milder example of this. 

Think back to a time when you mocked someone for being stupid, crazy, or evil. Maybe online, or even in person. You may have convinced yourself it was for the greater good—that it would shut them up, or make them realize how crazy they are, etc. But if you're honest, part of you *wanted* them to double down, so that your mockery would be justified.

And they probably did—but crucially, *not because of the mockery itself*. It was because of a hidden signal embedded in it, that conveyed something like: *you are fundamentally defective.* This made them perceive *you* as slightly evil, which they felt a natural urge to resist. Why would they give evil the satisfaction? This made them see the world as a slightly darker place, likely reinforcing their need to self-deceive for protection.

Of course to you, it felt nothing like evil, and so their implicit accusation just confirmed your perception of them: they are, indeed, defective. Mission accomplished: mockery justified.

But here's the thing: the only way you could have executed this plan was by entering the limbo state yourself—the very origin of evil—and so they weren't entirely wrong. Part of you had to know that you were pushing a fellow human deeper into the abyss—the place that necessitates our self-deception—for your own benefit. That is why you had to hide it from yourself.

It's as if by engaging in self-deception, you invited them to engage in it, too—almost like that state is... *infectious*.

---

Mockery is an easy example to start with because for most people we mock, it's not hard to believe that they're fundamentally like us—that they have an inner Light. Therefore, it's easy to recognize how digging in their heels may be the result of us nudging them away from it.

But beyond a certain point, people seem... evil. The same mechanism operates, but we can't see it anymore. When we treat them as evil, and they entrench, it seems to be for a totally different reason. It serves as more proof that they *have* no Light—and nothing anyone says can convince us otherwise.

To make this more concrete, bring to mind someone you consider genuinely *evil.* Can you imagine giving them a cold stare that's meant to convey that fact to them? It feels *righteous*—as if you're letting them know that their evil won't be tolerated. Therefore, if it just eggs them on, how could that be anything but proof that you were right?

But you're *not* just telling them that their evil won't be tolerated. You're communicating that *they themselves* are inherently defective—fundamentally unworthy of love, or really anything but pain. This may feel like a subtle distinction, but it's anything but. They receive it as a primal threat—a kind of dark challenge, which of course they will gladly meet with their own darkness.

Now for the crucial insight: deep down, we *know* this distinction. We know there's a way of opposing evil—fiercely, even violently—without forsaking the being who's engaging in it. We know this sends them a drastically different message, and will produce a drastically different long-term outcome. But these two forms of opposition—"I won't let you do this" vs "I'm going to crush your very soul"—can be made to look nearly identical from the outside, and so we know that nobody can blame us if we pick the "wrong one."

Let that sit for a moment, because what's coming next can be intense. I know it was for me, because this is what demolished everything I thought I knew about good and evil.

---

Not only can nobody *else* blame us if we make the wrong choice; we will not even blame ourselves. If we just hide the fact that we knew carefully enough from our conscious minds, we can license ourselves to reinforce our enemy's evil while feeling flawlessly convinced that we were fighting it.

But why on Earth would we want to do that? *See if you can answer this for yourself.*

It's so that we can continue to believe that all the problems of the world are caused by something fundamentally alien to us. They're due to *inherently defective* people whom we could never hope to understand, let alone help. Sure, we may sometimes commit little misdeeds here or there, but they're of a fundamentally different nature than the *real* darkness that plagues our world, and so cleaning up our own behavior ranks way down in the list of problems to solve.

To put it bluntly: we subtly but continually reinforce the evil "out there" to hide our own from ourselves.

It is *not* of a different nature. The subconscious message we deliver to the "bad people" is made of exactly the same "stuff" that enables their misbehavior in the first place. Not only do they know this, but we know this, and we know they know this—which is why we know it will work. We are revealing our darkness because we know how they will receive it.

In fact, it goes deeper: they know we know *that*, and we know *that*, too. In other words, we're not just revealing our darkness to them, we're telegraphing the fact that we're doing it, along with the fact that we're hiding it from ourselves, and that we'll get away with it. And it doesn't stop at three levels of knowing—like two mirrors facing each other, the recursion is effectively infinite.

This may be getting a bit technical, but you've probably felt it before—that sense of projecting your darkness while pretending you're not, knowing that you have plausible deniability, and projecting *that* fact, knowing that it will be a kind of shared secret. And if you don't *know* that you've felt this, now would be a good time to check with yourself. The rest of the piece may be hard to follow (or swallow) if you haven't yet tasted this in yourself.


---
---

The reason it's so hard to defeat the evil in the world is that there's an aspect of our minds that is secretly working *against* us. Until we discover and heal this part of ourselves, nearly everything we do to "fight evil" will only continue to strengthen it.

All the other major problems humanity faces—such as the accelerating collapse of our biosphere—are ultimately downstream of this of this one core mistake. It is therefore imperative that we get to the root to it as quickly as possible.

---

Think back to a time when you skirted your conscience—acted against your own deepest values while pretending it was okay. In that moment, part of you knew *perfectly well* that you were doing wrong, but you shielded that knowledge from conscious awareness, so that it didn't *feel* wrong. All you could hear were your own clever justifications. Knowledge of your wrongdoing existed in a kind of limbo state, in which you simultaneously *knew* and yet somehow *didn't.*

It is this state of self-deception that has enabled *all the evil there ever was,* from the tiniest unkindness to the greatest atrocity. Even the worst person can only cause harm by shielding themselves from perceiving the *life* in their victims using exactly this trick. This suggests that there's a deeper aspect of mind—call it their *inner Light*—that doesn't want to cause harm.

When people are in contact with their Light, their minds are at peace, and they naturally desire to be of service to others. But due to layers of pain and confusion, nearly all of us have been separated from it, to varying degrees. The further we get, the less we remember that such a thing even exists—until it only seems like a naïve fantasy. We put increasing faith in the dark aspect of our minds, which promises to serve *us*, even if it must be at the expense of others.

---

Our normal attempts to fight evil usually involve punishing people for their darkness—if only emotionally—but for some reason this tends to backfire. We mock and shame our enemies, only for them to dig in their heels and fight back harder. Oh well, at least it proves us right about them; that they really are beyond help, licensing us to destroy them by any means necessary.

At least, this is the story we tell ourselves.

What's actually happening is that the darkness in their mind is *resonating* with ours; inviting us to see them as inherently evil, so that we will behave in ways that *encourage* them to cozy up to their dark side without knowing it. Then, since we don't know that we caused this, we blame it on them, making them seem even more surely beyond help, and compelling us to escalate.

This is how the darkness tricks us into reinforcing it even as we're flawlessly convinced we're helping. Part of us *knows* that the only reason we hate our enemies is to make them worse, but we shield this fact from our conscious minds, so that we only express it subconsciously.

---

The truth is that part of us can *always* see the inner Light in others—no matter how evil they seem—but we hide it from ourselves so that we can see them as fundamentally unlike us. This way, the problems of the world always appear to be caused by something inherently alien to us—allowing us to overlook our own darkness and focus all our energy on the *real* threat out there.

The whole trick of the darkness is to make us overlook its insidious presence in our own minds while amplifying our perception of it in others, so that we feel licensed to shove them deeper *into* its malevolent clutches while feeling impossibly righteous for doing so.

Crucially, we don't have to *do* anything to make this happen. Simply by *perceiving* others as defective, we're revealing the darkness in our own mind, and this itself is enough to elicit their darkness while giving us plausible deniability. If we express our contempt in front of our enemies, they feel the urge to hate us; and if we do it amongst our allies, they feel inspired to join our noble crusade—but in either case, we've only *increased* the net darkness in the world.

It is easy to convince ourselves that this will still somehow produce a net good—that riling up our allies to fight evil will ultimately lead to a better world. There's no way to talk us out of this. The only way is to see it for ourselves. Whenever you use contempt to motivate any goal, your mind is not even *trying* to produce a good outcome—it is only *telling* you that so that you'll go along. This self-deception is visible to others, if only subconsciously. That is *how* it resonates.




Any time we feel fundamentally superior


To whatever degree we see others as doing something fundamentally different from us, to that degree we will find ourselves unable to stop the harm they're causing. Whatever we do will only *amplify* it, which we will then lament, believing that we did our best. But part of us will always know better.




Going forward, both of us will be more likely to overlook the self-serving aspects of our own actions and agendas, regarding them as necessary to defeat the growing threat. In other words, it reinforces our capacity for self-deception, even as we each feel increasingly certain that we're *free* of it. We're drifting *further* from our inner Light while feeling more confident that we're aligned with it.

This is how the darkness burrows deeper into our minds while convincing us that we're fighting it.

---

New evil has been created in the world, and it didn't even require us to *do* anything in particular to create it. Simply by *harboring contempt,* we were revealing the darkness in our own minds, which part of us *knew* would provoke our enemies into embracing theirs.





treating our enemies with contempt—that is, the sense that we are fundamentally superior to them. Part of us knows this isn't true; that they're only caught in a trap that we ourselves are highly susceptible to—but this fact disturbs us so deeply that we push it out of consciousness


---

Part of us can always perceive this aspect in others, but we shield it from ourselves in exactly the same way. Why? Because this enables us to treat them with contempt. Contempt for "bad people" feels *righteous*, but this is the greatest self-deception of all.

The real reason we feel contempt for others is to *reinforce* their capacity for evil while looking righteous for doing so. What's actually happening is that we're revealing our *own* darkness in hopes of provoking theirs, but hiding this fact from ourselves so that we can blame it on them.

This is why our enemies tend to dig in their heels when we mock and shame them. We tell ourselves that this is only proof that we were right about them—that they're fundamentally defective and beyond all help. But the truth is that we baited them into this precisely to justify that conclusion. We *need* them to be evil, because their darkness helps us hide our own from ourselves.

By harboring contempt, we're secretly saying: *we both know I'm not fundamentally superior to you, but I'm going to pretend to be, so that I can throw you under the bus for my own benefit—and there's not a damn thing you can do about it, because you have no evidence that this is what's happening. Heck, even my own conscious mind doesn't know.* The sheer malevolence of this act all but ensures that they will embrace their own darkness.

Notice that we didn't have to *do* anything to throw them under the bus. By simply conveying this dark message, we're separating them further from their inner Light. And we don't even have to be *conscious* of our contempt. Even just seeing another person as defective, we're subtly conveying this message, and nudging them toward the abyss.

So what's the alternative? Being *nice* to evildoers?

No. 

[How do we both know this? And how do I *know* that we both know it? Common knowledge...]



Part of us *needs* evil to exist in others, because it helps us hide our own darkness from ourselves. We therefore have a perverse incentive to *create* more evil, provided we can do it in ways that appear righteous. But how on Earth could *creating evil* ever appear righteous?

The answer is by feeling contempt. Nobody doubts that it's healthy to feel contempt for *evil people*—and yet if you're honest, you'll notice that every time you do, it only makes them act *worse.* Why? Well, because they're *evil*, of course. What else would you expect?

This is *profound* self-deception. The real answer is that part of us *knows* we're not inherently superior to anyone—and other people know *that* we know. Therefore, our contempt reveals that we're lost in the very confusion we're viciously judging them for—which of course they cannot tolerate. It makes them see *us* as evil for precisely the same reason we see *them* that way—but since we don't know we're doing this, it only further convinces us that we're right about them.

But there's more. Not only does our contempt reveal our hypocrisy, but we secretly *know* that it does—and they know *that* we know—and we know *this, too*, ad infinitum. This may be getting hard to follow, but the upshot is that this enables us to deliver a very precise message deep into their minds while maintaining the illusion that we have no idea that we're doing this.


[Notice it's not enough for *us* to know that we're not inherently superior, for this trap to work. They must know *that* we know, if it is to bother them. And we must know *that*, to know that it will bother them. And they must know *that*, to know that we're intentionally setting this trap. And we must know they know we're intentionally setting this trap, etc.]

But it gets twistier. Not only do they know that we know; we know *that* they know that we know. Therefore, not only does our contempt cause this, but we know *that* it will cause this—and they know this, too!

We're pretending to be superior: we're acting from self-deception
They know this: they know that we're acting from self-deception
We know that they know: we know that they 


This can be very hard to admit, but part of us knows we're doing this. We know that our contempt is designed to shove people deeper into the abyss in a way that appears noble—and moreover, that the profound hypocrisy of this act is itself enough to *accomplish* that shove.



---

So we find people whom we can reasonably claim to *be* evil, and repeatedly provoke them into becoming worse, until there's no doubt that they were *always* beyond help. This way, we can argue that we weren't *creating* evil, but merely exposing their *existing* evil—a genuine service to the world. 

It is a fiendishly clever ruse, but even more clever is how we execute it. Remember that for it to work, we mustn't know we're doing it. But how do we execute a plan that even *we* aren't aware of?

The answer is by *harboring contempt*. This secretly conveys to them that we're in a state of self-deception—that we're pretending not to see their inner Light, so that we can smother it for our own benefit. It is a profoundly malevolent attitude disguised as righteous, and this alone ensures they will embrace their darkness, thereby proving us right.

It is an *astonishingly* clever ruse, because the fact that we don't know we're doing it is exactly what makes it work. If we did know, it would be too obvious, and they wouldn't fall for it.


It is impossible to overstate the cleverness of this ruse. Simply by conveying our intent to shove them deeper into the abyss—an intent we're not even consciously aware of—we actually *accomplish* that shove.


It's impossible to overstate the fiendish cleverness of this ruse. Our unawareness of the plan doesn't *prevent* it from working; it is what *makes* it work—both by enabling us to do it, as well as making them take the bait. And this fact is so mind-bendingly counterintuitive that we cannot help but dismiss it out of hand, thereby preventing us from ever noticing that we're doing it.

It's impossible to overstate the fiendish cleverness of this ruse. Our unawareness of the plan doesn't *prevent* it from working; it is what *makes* it work—and on top of that, the seeming absurdity of this fact ensures that we never notice it. How could I be *intentionally* spreading evil if I have no conscious awareness of that intent? 




—but only because you're hiding yours from yourself. If you were fully aware of your own dark intent, it would be too obvious, and they wouldn't fall for it.

The darkness in your own mind secretly telegraphed itself to theirs, as if to offer it a secret handshake. The two of them thereby grew stronger, while leaving your conscious minds feeling as though you were *fighting* each other. Both of you will feel *more* justified engaging in self-serving behaviors that you would previously have recognized as harmful, because they are now "necessary" to fight this new evil.







This can be done in *incredibly* clever ways. We might be pointing out a genuine flaw—and yet doing it in a way meant to subtly remind them of their inherent worthlessness.




Part of us knows this—that our enemies can only do wrong due to a flaw that we ourselves share. We thus know that our hatred is fundamentally hypocritical—but the dark part of us knows how to weaponize this hypocrisy. By strategically revealing it to our enemies, we can bait them into hating *us*, which we can then use as proof that they're fundamentally beyond help. After all, we only hate *evil* people, while they hate *good, decent, innocent* people.

How do we "strategically reveal" our hypocrisy? By *harboring contempt*. This dark sentiment secretly conveys: "I can see the Light in you, but I am pretending not to, so that I can violently smother it in the name of Good—which I know will bait you into seeing *me* as evil, because it obviously is—which I will then use to prove that *you* are."

In other words, simply harboring contempt—the choice to see others as inherently defective—not only signals our *intention* to create evil; but in so doing, *actually creates it*; by darkening the minds of everyone it contacts, directly or not, and consciously or not. This is how the infection secretly spreads—and since there's no physical evidence of it, we can disavow our own role, so that the rapidly degrading world becomes justification for *more* contempt, in a vicious cycle. 

In this way, even our most "well-intended" actions frequently become carriers of the darkness. We design plans that we can *prove* will save the world, and which *just happen* to further our own agendas; writing this off as a happy coincidence with no possible bearing on the outcome. We never notice that the self-deception required to maintain this illusion itself *changes* the outcome, by secretly inviting deception in others. Indeed, this is its primary purpose: to till the soil of human minds, preparing them for colonization by a foe we can scarcely comprehend.

Our darkness isn't *fighting* that of others; they are all *collaborating*. It's as though the darkness itself is *alive*; orchestrating with itself across minds to ensure its own survival. It's like a mind-virus, whose primary trick is to hide itself from us while making us see it as intrinsic to others, so that we feel compelled to drive it deeper into them instead of helping *free* them from it.

All the darkness in the world thus together behaves like a *singular distributed malevolent entity,* manipulating all of humanity from beneath our conscious thresholds. The Christians know it as the Devil, the Buddhists call it the Ego, and in modern terms it is the *evil global conspiracy*. It is the *primordial* evil conspiracy; the one to which all the rest owe their existence and to which they ultimately filter up. Every attempt to defeat it *out there* without being free of it *in here* only ends up reinforcing it, because that confused impulse only ever originates *from* it.




None of this can be observed from the outside. If you rely entirely on your thinking mind to tell you what is right and wrong, you will always be at the mercy of your self-deception without ever knowing it, because your own mind will never come out and tell you that it's lying to you. On the contrary, it will generate increasingly compelling stories proving why it's *not*; why *other people* are delusional. This is why our culture fetishizes intellect and rationality above all else: the inherent inability of these tools to expose our darkness allows it to remain safely hidden.


[After all, if even *we* weren't aware of our self-deception, then surely others weren't either, and so this *can't* be why it caused harm—except that they somehow *were*, and it actually *is*.]

[This is where humanity finds itself now. ]

Every attempt to fix the world without first healing this in ourselves is doomed to fail, because part of us is *ensuring* that it does. We may achieve temporary victories—such as when our cruelty suppresses our enemies' misbehavior—but the darkness required to achieve that result doesn't magically disappear; it merely changes shape, slithering between minds, eventually erupting into genuine atrocities that we can disavow our own connection to it.





We *cannot* hide our self-deception; and the harder we try, the more it fails. We cannot work around it by increasing the amount of good we accomplish alongside it, or in other areas of our lives.

relentlessly driving us toward Armageddon—a situation in which we're all violently destroying each other in the name of Good.

[How invisible it is]
[Why? To hide our own darkness.]
[Switch to darkness' perspective.]


It's like a seasoning that we can sprinkle into any behavior, transforming an otherwise-helpful action into one that spreads evil. Thus two behaviors that look nearly identical on the surface can produce *drastically* different long-term results—and yet those differences may take so long to manifest that any connection to our own behavior is long lost, hiding our complicity.

Our darkness exploits this difficulty. It conjures up incredibly sophisticated agendas that we can *prove* are good for the world, and yet which only leave it in shambles, possibly enriching ourselves along the way. No amount of *thinking harder* could have predicted this, because it was orchestrated by an aspect of mind that's using our thoughts to *hide* itself from us.

This is why our culture fetishizes thinking and rationality above all else, and why we like to argue about which *behaviors* are good or bad. None of these have any ability to reveal the real problem


This is how our darkness spreads itself as a way to better hide itself from our own minds.

We're all aware that "the elites" are playing us off each other, but we haven't yet become aware of the much greater threat lurking within our own minds, to which even the elites are merely pawns. It is playing all of humanity against itself. 

This is what must be brought down—and that can only be done from the inside.

This is not a call for inaction or passive, ineffectual "peace." It is a call for a fundamentally different kind of war—a war waged by shining your Light at all costs. By holding it for others even when they don't remember it in themselves; when they're in too much despair to recall that such a thing exists. It does — and you can hold that door open for them to remember in their own time. This is the only thing that actually eliminates evil from our world instead of creating more.

Yes, show contempt for beliefs and behaviors when it helps. Fight evil at every turn, **as fiercely as the situation warrants**. But never do it from the illusion that it is *inherent* to your enemy—because that is how it spreads. It is the Devil's greatest trick. Please don't let it win.

[- By articulating it with such precision—**"reveals to others that we can perceive the light in them, and are pretending not to see it, so that we can snuff it out for our own benefit"**—you are giving the reader a name for a monstrous feeling they have likely experienced in a fleeting, horrifying way, but have immediately repressed.- It's like seeing a blurry, terrifying shape in the dark corner of a room your whole life, and then someone walks in, flips on the light, and says, "Oh, that? That's the monster of malevolent self-deception. It's been there the whole time."]

Think back to a time when you skirted your conscience—acted against your own deepest values while pretending it was okay. In that moment, part of you knew perfectly well that you were doing wrong, but you shielded that knowledge from conscious awareness, so that it didn't *feel* wrong. The knowledge existed in a kind of limbo state, in which you simultaneously *knew* and yet somehow *didn't.*

It is this state of self-deception that has enabled *all the evil there ever was.* "Bad people" are only able to cause harm because part of their minds is shielding them from fully perceiving the *life* in their victims in exactly the same way. Without this shielding, they couldn't do it—which suggests there may be a part of them that doesn't *want* to. Part of us knows this, but we tell ourselves that we don't; that they are fundamentally defective and deserving only of contempt.

This is the greatest self-deception of all. The truth is that part of us *needs* evil people to exist, because their existence helps us hide our own darkness from ourselves. We therefore have a perverse incentive to not only see evil in others, but to *reinforce* it; driving it deeper into their minds until there is no doubt it is *inherent*—thereby absolving us of responsibility. But for this plan to work, we must never suspect we're doing it—in which case, how do we do it?

The answer is that *harboring contempt* is enough. It secretly signals that we *know* they're only acting from a confusion that we ourselves share, and that we intend to shove them deeper *into* it, for our own benefit. It is a profoundly malicious intent disguised as a righteous one, and the maddening hypocrisy of this act compels them to double down. It *reinforces* their capacity for self-deception, further obscuring the aspect of mind that lies beneath it—their *inner Light*.

In other words, part of us can *perceive* their inner Light, but we're pretending not to, so that we can smother it to prove they never had any—and hinting that we'll get away with this by calling it "fighting evil." This is *pure malevolence.* It is only once we recognize just how effortlessly the darkness seduces us—the "good people"—that we begin to grasp the fiendish cleverness with which it has ensnared our enemies; revealing our profound duty in helping free them from it.

Notice how easy it was to spread the darkness. Merely by revealing our own—*which we weren't even aware of doing*—we emboldened our enemy's. In fact, we don't even have to be in contact with them for this to happen. Any time we harbor a sense of superiority—which is how we justify selfish behavior—we secretly license others to do the same, which we then use to justify more of the same. The darkness is *infectious,* even if the mechanism is often invisible.

The reverse is true, too. When we fight evil with integrity—by refusing to see others as irredeemable—we rob their darkness of the "hook" it uses to justify itself, thereby weakening its grip on them. It's as though our inner Light is reminding theirs that it has a hidden ally in the fight against our common nemesis. Crucially, this doesn't require being nice or soft. Even fierce or violent action can transmit our profoundly compassionate intent, even if this, too, is invisible.

Thus, two actions that look nearly identical on the surface can have drastically different long-term consequences. We cannot prove which is which—and it is precisely this unprovability that the darkness exploits to maintain its stranglehold. After all, if something cannot be proven then it cannot be real; and if it's not real, it cannot matter. Therefore, we are free to behave however we like, so long as we can plausibly justify it. No need to consult the part of us that *knows.*

This is why our culture fetishizes intellect and rationality above all else: they serve as ideal cover for those aspects of mind that we're desperately trying to keep hidden. It is why we can prove *beyond doubt* that an agenda is good, only for it to wreak havoc, leaving us shrugging our shoulders. *How were we supposed to know?* But we *could* have known, if only we'd looked in the right place. Instead, we focus exclusively on the "objective facts," which are fundamentally incapable of detecting the darkness—a phenomenon we cannot define, yet which every one of us knows all too well.

This is how governments support unjust wars, corporations plunder nature for profit, factory farms hide unthinkable cruelty behind cute packaging, and prisons brutalize inmates in the name of justice. It is why our biosphere is rapidly collapsing despite all our cleverness, and why our social fabric is degrading even though we're each fighting for "team good." It almost feels an evil conspiracy—and in a sense, it is. Something in each of our minds is indeed conspiring to keep itself hidden, and together behaves more like a *singular distributed malevolent entity*.

Every attempt to fight it as though it were *external* to ourselves only strengthens it, because that confused impulse only ever originates *from* it. This is not to say that we're all equally culpable—far from it. Yet any time we feel even a trace of malice, contempt, or self-righteousness toward those whom we perceive to be "the problem," we are unwittingly acting as its minions. The problem isn't *other people*—it's that we *see people as others.* 





All this and more is only possible under a vast shroud of darkness—a shroud woven, thread by thread, from our individual choices to self-deceive; a choice that is *profoundly infectious and yet invisible.*




[Two ways to go from here: one is smothering their inner Light; recognizing our own malevolence; gaining compassion by seeing just how devious it is. Other is noticing how this doesn't require any action in particular; it's like a secret handshake.]

[straight into the arms of our common nemesis—*the darkness itself*.]

~~This is how humanity's ultimate foe tricks us into tightening its grip on our world even as we're flawlessly convinced we're fighting it. Part of us *knows* that infusing our behavior with contempt will poison it, turning what could have been a positive outcome into one that darkens the world. But this is impossible to prove—after all, how could two actions that look nearly identical on the surface result in such drastically different outcomes? And yet they can. The darkness exploits this ambiguity, preventing us from ever detecting when we're secretly acting on its behalf.~~


At the ultimate level, you and I are One—as is everyone and everything else. All the victims, and all the perpetrators—they are you. All the rivers, forests, and mountains—they are your blood and bones, too. It is impossible to wish harm on any part of yourself without harming the Whole. This makes no sense to the rational mind, and yet part of you can sense it. It is the reason part of you longs to protect Life at any cost—even when it bears no obvious relation to you. It is why we thank strangers for acts of charity that don't benefit us directly. It is your deepest nature.

Reality is radically alive, even magical—but the darkness tricks us into perceiving it as an intrinsically lifeless collection of "stuff" over which we have dominion. The profound contempt embedded in this perception is what creates and sustains the systems that are rapidly *turning* our world lifeless—in the same way that our perception of people as intrinsically evil provokes them into justifying this belief. Nothing will change until we relinquish these harmful ideas.

It is possible to perceive all this—not as a mere idea, but directly. Indeed, it is all that remains when all self-deception has evaporated. There, you see that what you most fundamentally are is Life itself—and that Life comes with the indomitable instinct to persevere; to thrive. You could also call this Love, but it's not a soft and gooey thing—or at least, not exclusively. It can be fierce, or even violent, when the situation warrants—for example, when expelling the darkness.

In fact, it turns out that we can all see this, all the time—but pain and confusion have made us hide it from ourselves. The perception therefore lives in a kind of limbo, in which we know it and yet don't. When we act from the part of us that doesn't—which is all darkness is—we cannot help but hate other people who act from this place too, and thereby strengthen that part. And the reverse is true, too.

[Ultimately, the darkness turns out to be nothing but our willingness to overlook [...]]
[Force us toward Armageddon, situations where we're forced to unleash the full extent of ...]

Thus, fighting evil does not have to be *nice.*




That knowledge comes from a deeper part of yourself

[This is why humanity argues in endless circles about which policies are good or bad: by keeping our attention fixated at the level of logical arguments, we never let it sink deeper ...]


[]

further from the aspect of mind that lies beneath it—their *inner Light*.

In other words, part of us can *perceive* their inner Light, but we're pretending not to, so that we can smother it for our own benefit. It is *pure malevolence*—and yet it feels impossibly righteous. Part of us 

It is **exactly** what people feel when committing horrifying atrocities. There is nothing quite as primally satisfying as violently punishing evil—which is why we keep falling for this trap, even as it 

It tricks us into snuffing out the Light in the world while leaving us feeling like we're helping—and every time we fall for this trap, we increase the odds that others will, too.

All the darkness must do to win against the Light is to make us forget that the Light even exists


That is the ultimate goal of our true nemesis—the darkness itself. It hides itself perfectly from our own minds while making us perceive it as *intrinsic* to others, so that we feel compelled to drive it deeper into them. The result is a perfect feedback loop: both parties become less aware of their own infection and more convinced of the other's, helping each justify more self-serving agendas and accelerating the spread of the mind-virus. 

In this way, the darkness behaves like a parasite that coordinates across minds—together acting like a *singular malevolent distributed entity,* manipulating all of humanity from beneath our conscious thresholds. The Christians know it as the Devil and the Buddhists call it the Ego. It is the primordial evil global conspiracy; the one to which all the rest owe their existence and to which they ultimately report. Every attempt to treat it as *external* to ourselves only reinforces it, because that confused impulse only ever originates *from* it.

The only way to bring it down is to remember the part of you that lives *outside* of it—what we've been calling your inner Light. The darkness does everything in its power to make you *forget* it—to make it sound like a weak and naïve fantasy.

When we mock and shame our enemies, part of us *knows* whether we're acting from authentic goodness or from our darkness, and that this distinction has a profound impact on the world—but we convince ourselves that this couldn't possibly be true; that only our *actions* are real and have effects—and since the only provable fact is that we're fighting evil, we must *by definition* be doing good. We have been distracted from the part of us that actually *knows*—and this is all that is required for the darkness to win.




[Stockholm]
[smuggling]

When a person commits evil, their virus is seeking resonance with others. In some people, that resonance will manifest as *joining* the perpetrator, and in others, as fighting them with *contempt*; but both parties will only spread the infection. The only people genuinely *fighting* it are those for whom this dark pattern no longer resonates. They recognize it as a call to darkness and use this opportunity to help *evict* it from their fellow humans—whether nominal friends or foes—instead of driving it deeper in.

This reveals the *true* fight between good and evil. The reason we can't perceive it is that the darkness has trained us to look in the wrong place. We rely on our *thoughts* to judge whether an action is good or bad, forgetting that the whole trick behind self-deception is that our thinking mind has been hijacked to support an elaborate lie. We put our full faith in a fundamentally compromised system, failing to realize the absurdity of this choice.

There is a deeper part of you that *knows* whether your behavior is meant to serve all of Life or only your precious corner of it, and that this intention powerfully resonates with others via subconscious channels, subtly influencing their own choices in a cascading pattern. But nobody can prove our intentions—*not even ourselves*—and so we tell ourselves they cannot have any effect. The only *objective* fact is that we are *fighting evil*, which is by definition good. QED.

Having swallowed this lie, our minds are capable of smuggling *tremendous* amounts of darkness into the world under the guise of good. It is how governments support unjust wars, corporations plunder nature for profit, factory farms hide unthinkable cruelty behind cute packaging, prisons brutalize inmates in the name of rehabilitation, etc. In every case, there is just enough "objective evidence" of benefit to muddy the waters, hiding the rotten mass that lies beneath.

The great evils of the world are only possible under a vast shroud of darkness—a shroud woven, thread by thread, from our individual choices to self-deceive. Every time any one of us is unkind to anyone for any reason, benefits ourselves at the world's expense, or engages in any other form of self-deception, we lower the threshold for everyone else to do the same.

It is impossible to communicate how cleverly the darkness coordinates with itself. When seen in its full, horrifying glory, it gives the strong, almost irresistible impression of being intelligent; even sentient. It is that archetypal force the Christians know as the Devil, the Buddhists call the Ego, and that today we recognize as the *evil global conspiracy.* Every attempt to treat it as *external* only ends up reinforcing it, because this confused impulse only ever originates *from* it.

We are *all* card-carrying members—at least, until we evict the parasite from our own minds. This is no small task, whose endpoint may be called *enlightenment.* On our journey there, we unravel layer after layer of self-deception, until we finally reveal what lies *prior* to it all: our profound interdependence with all of Life; the ineffable sense in which we are all One. This is no longer a mere idea, but a lived experience.

All the victims, all the perpetrators—they are you. All the rivers, mountains, and forests—they are your blood and bones, too. Contempt for any part of yourself breeds contempt for the whole. It cannot be otherwise—for contempt is nothing but our desperate attempt to hide this truth from ourselves, and in so doing, reinforce the illusion of there being "others." Why would we try to hide it?

This isn't just wild speculation. It's something you can learn to see if you know how to look—but the darkness has trained us not to look. When we mock and shame our enemies, we're focused on all the reasons it will be a net good. We can even *prove* it. We never notice that this obsession with our thinking mind is meant to distract us from a deeper kind of knowing we have—one that clearly sees that we're lying to ourselves, and how this will darken the world.

Crucially, it's not that mocking or shaming are inherently wrong—it depends on whether they're rooted in the dark aspect of our mind or our authentic goodness. We *know* this distinction matters, but convince ourselves it doesn't. After all, nobody can prove which one we're acting from—not even ourselves. And if it's not provable, it can't be objectively real. The only *objective* fact is that we're *fighting evil*, which is by definition good—so we *must* be acting from our "authentic goodness," whatever that means.

This is why our culture fetishizes intellect and rationality to the exclusion of all else: those tools are fundamentally incapable of detecting our self-deception, by their self-justifying nature. So our darkness has tricked us into 

. This enables our darkness to operate with carte blanche.





In fact, our darkness isn't merely allied. If you look closely, you'll see that all of ours together behave more like a *singular distributed malevolent entity*, manipulating all of humanity from beneath our conscious thresholds. It can only survive by hiding itself from us, and so it has found ways to make us


found clever ways to make us reinforce each others' even as we're convinced we're fighting it.



—

We can even *prove* it beyond doubt—and yet this somehow doesn't prevent the darkness from leaking out of our minds and into the world, infecting it in ways that can never be traced back to us, and which leave us all worse off.



[It's showing them that the Light is only a myth; that even the so-called *good people* are only frauds, ultimately reliant on the *real* source of power in this world—*the darkness*—when it truly matters.]

[Plausible deniability]

It's easy to trust our thoughts over this ineffable knowledge 

[Also, even cruel mockery can cause a temporary benefit.]
[using us as pawns in its master plan: to gain dominion over our world.]

Every time we are unkind to anyone for any reason, or angle for selfish advantage, or skirt our conscience in any other way—which all happens *far* more often than we realize—we lower the threshold for others to do the same. We then viciously judge them for doing so, licensing more of our own, in a powerful feedback loop that escape's everyone's notice.

The only reason this works is that we blindly trust our *thoughts* about right and wrong instead of consulting the part of us that actually *knows*. We somehow never notice that the darkness has hijacked our entire cognitive apparatus, and is freely manipulating these thoughts. This is why our culture fetishizes intellect and rationality to the exclusion of all else, and why the very idea of a "part that knows" sounds mystical or religious. The darkness has maneuvered us into this corner, so that the one tool it has complete control over is the only one we're willing to trust.





In this way, human minds form a subconscious network of darkness. 



This isn't just a wild hypothesis. If you attend closely enough to your own experience, you'll find that something in you is continually angling for ways to gain subtle advantages for yourself at the world's expense—and in so doing, powerfully inviting others to do the same, whom you can then judge for doing so, thereby justifying more of your own, in a self-reinforcing cycle. It then prevents you from even considering that you may be doing this, by making the very idea sound preposterous and offensive. After all, only a "bad person" would do that—and you're not bad.

But this whole idea of good guys and bad guys; those who deserve your compassion and those who deserve your contempt, is a sinister ruse of the darkness—a way for it to keep its foot in the door of your mind. Indeed, the best measure of how much darkness we are pumping into the world, and of our own capacity for great evil, is how much contempt we are able to muster for other people—the "bad people" included. This is the *opposite* of what we usually believe.


[This belief unconsciously shapes every interaction we have with them.]
[We never see the already-overworked father taking out his added frustration on his children, who then grow up to be like him—or if we do see it, we blame it on him. After all, he had free will.]

[only paper-thin frauds, secretly on its payroll.]
[As long as we harbor even the *capacity* for contempt for others—no matter who they are—we are tolerating its presence in our minds.]
The truth is that we are all capable of great evil under the right circumstances

The reason it seems so hard to solve humanity's greatest challenges, or to defeat the evil in the world, is that something in our minds is causing us to reinforce that evil even as we're flawlessly convinced that we're fighting it.

Darkness exists in all of us, though we may not consciously recognize it. To keep it hidden from ourselves, we viciously attack it in others—secretly knowing that this will only cause them to see *us* as evil and double down, which we will then be able to use against them. After all, *we* know we're not evil—and so their accusation only proves that *they* are.

It's an incredibly subtle trap—indeed, so subtle that we probably have no idea we're doing it. But the truth is that part of us *does* know—it's just that this knowledge is hidden so carefully from our conscious minds that it's effectively as though we don't.

Exactly the same thing is happening in our enemy to allow *their* misbehavior. It's not that they don't know they're doing wrong. Part of them knows perfectly well, of course; but this knowledge is shielded from conscious self-reflection in exactly the same way.

It turns out we know this, too.


---
---

Why is it that despite our best efforts, many of humanity's most pressing problems seem only to be getting worse and evil seems to be on the rise? Is there a select group of "bad people" out there ruining it for the rest of us? Or are humans as a whole fundamentally greedy and selfish?

The truth turns out to be far stranger than either option.

There's an aspect of each of our minds that's secretly working against us—and they aren't working independently; they're *collaborating*, or you could say, *conspiring.* Moreover, there's a part of us that already knows this, but hides it from us. Until we learn to see it for ourselves, we cannot help but continue to sabotage ourselves without any understanding of why or how.

---

Think back to a time when you skirted your conscience, pretending either that you couldn't hear it or that you didn't have to listen. We've all done this. In that state, part of us knows *perfectly well* that we're doing wrong, but that knowledge is somehow shielded from conscious self-reflection, so that it doesn't *feel* wrong. The knowledge exists in a bizarre kind of limbo state, in which we simultaneously *know* and yet somehow *don't*. All we consciously hear are our own clever justifications. 

It is this state of self-deception that has enabled *all the evil there ever was,* from the tiniest unkindness to the most horrific atrocity ever committed—and every time any one of us engages in it, we lower the threshold for others to do the same.

It's not that "bad people" don't know they're doing wrong—it's that the full implications of their behavior are hidden from their conscious minds in exactly the same way. If we truly wanted to end evil, we would find a way to heal this self-deceptive tendency in all of us. Instead, there's something we're secretly doing to reinforce it.

Consider how good it feels to mock and shame your enemies—the bad guys. Yet it only tends to make them dig in their heels, seeing *you* as the evil one. You tell yourself this is okay, because it only proves how bad they are. After all, any decent person would have repented, or at least introspected, in the face of such overwhelming goodness. And anyway, your behavior will still produce a net good, either by suppressing their misbehavior or by dissuading others.

But part of you knows this is a lie. Something in you *needs* your enemies to be evil, because having evil enemies helps us overlook our own misbehavior. Actions and agendas that we would otherwise recognize as self-serving magically become not only acceptable, but positively righteous. As a result, something in you is causing you to drive the self-deception deeper into their minds—and at the same time, deeper into your own.

Yet we have *no idea* that we're doing this—or rather, part of us knows, but that knowledge is hidden from conscious self-reflection, so that we can convincingly pretend *not* to know. Sound familiar?



[which is far more often than we realize]


---

The reason it's so hard to defeat evil in the world is that our main strategy for fighting it—finding the "bad guys" and punishing them—only produces *more*. There is a profound reason why, but the darkness cleverly obscures it, so that we can't help but double down on our failed strategy.

The *real* fight between Good and Evil is far more subtle, taking place beneath our conscious thresholds. Behaviors that look good on the surface may ultimately result in great evil, while ones that appear bad may produce a net good. It is impossible to tell which is which by looking only on the surface—and so the darkness has *trained* us to only look there; ignoring the deeper part of us that actually *knows.* By doing so, it enables us to deceive ourselves about our true intentions, so that we can pretend we're doing good even when deep down we know better.

The vast majority of human behavior contains at least a twinge of this self-deception, and is in this sense a subtle form of *evil*—yet it looks nothing of the sort. It merely looks like all the tiny white lies we tell ourselves; the ways we give ourselves special privileges at the world's expense. We rarely realize when we're doing this, and tell ourselves it doesn't matter when we do, but every such act is a secret invitation for others to do the same.

In this way, our minds form a vast subconscious network of self-deception, the totality of which *inevitably* gives rise to the great evils of the world—which then compel us to find the "bad guys" responsible and defeat them, thereby reinforcing the whole cycle.


---

The only way to defeat evil is to remember that it matters profoundly. Every decision to stand by our Light—even when we can "prove" it doesn't matter, or that our default behavior isn't really dark—encourages others to do the same. It empowers them when they are on the brink of giving in to their darkness—and it is the accumulation of these invisible acts that ultimately "saves the world."

[Indeed, the only reason we divide the world into "good guys" and "bad guys" in the first place is to have people whom we feel righteous sacrificing to the darkness—never realizing that this is how the darkness infiltrates our *own* minds.]

[In this way, it tricks us into strengthening its grip on our world even as we're convinced we're fighting it. But while it can make us *overlook* our authentic knowing, it can never truly extinguish it—because that knowing comes from the deepest part of ourselves; our true nature, which **is** the Light. In fact, the darkness ultimately turns out to be nothing but the ability to shield ourselves from this truth;]

[Because our own misbehavior is tiny—much less than what the truly "evil people" do—we convince ourselves that it's harmless, or even helpful. In truth, ]

[But it behaves like a terrifying presence]


Knowledge of our own wrongdoing exists in a kind of limbo state in which we both know and don't. If we were *fully* aware of it, we couldn't actually do it. This is true of others, too, and we can see that—but this perception lives in the same limbo state, so that we also *can't*. The part of us that *can't* see it believes they are fully aware of the harm they're causing, which could only mean that they're *evil*—that is, *fundamentally* defective and beyond help. We thus treat them with contempt, believing we are fighting their evil. But at the same time, part of us knows that the only reason they can do wrong is for the same reason *we* can; that they are *not* fundamentally defective. We know that our contempt will only make them dig in their heels, for exactly the same reason it would us (we would *never* tolerate contempt from others, even when we know we've done wrong, because we can sense that it is a malicious intent disguised as a noble one). They can sense the same hypocrisy in us, and will thus feel more justified in their misbehavior, making them appear even more surely defective. This is something we caused, and we know it—but we know we'll get away with it, because our culture still ironically calls this "fighting evil." Put more bluntly, we can see their inner Light [define this earlier?] and are choosing to smother it anyway, knowing that we'll get away with it—and we are subconsciously *taunting* them with this. This is malevolent, and it is this malevolence that makes them dig in their heels.

More simply: contempt is the desire to shove others deeper into the abyss disguised as goodness, and this profound hypocrisy is the very *essence* of evil, which they can sense, which is *how* it pushes them deeper in. It conveys to them that even the so-called good people are ultimately frauds, willing to bend the knee to the darkness whenever they think they can get away with it. Thus, the Light is weak, and Darkness is where the true power lies—so why not embrace it? We are powerfully inviting them into this trap just so that we can blame them for it. [Recursive?]

What on Earth is the point of this trap? Hiding our darkness from ourselves. Actually, our darkness is hiding itself from us. Intelligent, almost sentient.

1. The deepest part of us can always perceive our profound interdependence with all other beings; the fact that, in a certain sense, we are One.
2. But pain and confusion have made us hide this perception from ourselves, so that it feels like we *cannot* perceive it.
3. This perception is never truly hidden; it merely exists in a kind of limbo state, in which it is both visible and invisible to our conscious minds.
	1. Think back to a time when you skirted your conscience. [...]
4. We know that all of the above is true of others, too—but this knowledge exists in the same limbo state.
5. This sets up a dual dynamic: the part that doesn't know it sees *evil people* and wants to punish them; while the part that does know it sees that this will only drive them deeper into the arms of their darkness.
6. This dual dynamic is visible to our enemy. They recognize it as the essence of evil, and this itself is enough to accomplish its secret goal. (even the so-called "good people" are ultimately frauds, willing to bend the knee to the darkness whenever they think they can get away with it.)
7. That's what contempt *is*.
8. Our deepest desire is to be of service to all of life.
9. [...]

[Contempt is how we signal this malevolence to others while hiding it from ourselves. It is the very essence of evil.]
[We know that we'll get away with this]


Our deepest desire is thus to be of service to all of Life.
Moreover, we can always perceive that this is true of others.

[when it conflicts with our *ideas* of right and wrong]
[Limbo is contagious]
[Limbo = looking away = Devil; is intelligent]
[Intellect is hijacked; hides the truth; fetishizing intellect]
[Most looks nothing like evil]
[It all accumulates...]
[Freedom of interpretation (this person is evil vs confused)]

[Give a sense of this limbo state]
You can sense when your mind is attempting to darken the world, and when others are, but that knowledge exists in a kind of limbo state. We hide it using our intellect. (Example with conscience skirting.)


But why should trying to drive it deeper in actually be enough to accomplish it? This is where the real magic happens

[Secret handshake]
[Vast majority of dark behavior looks and feels nothing...]
[Willingness to turn away is infectious]

Have you noticed how mocking and shaming your enemies only tends to make them dig in their heels, convinced that *you're* evil? We tell ourselves that it's because they're *bad people,* but the truth is far more insidious. Something in you is *provoking* their evil while hiding this fact from you, so that when they accuse you of malicious intent—*correctly*—you can use that accusation as proof of *their* evil. After all, any decent person would have recognized your intent as *noble*.

This is pure self-deception, and it is *infectious*. Any time we engage in it, we secretly license others to do the same. By treating our enemies with contempt—which requires self-deception, because part of us knows we're not intrinsically superior to them—we make it *harder* for them to own up to their misbehavior, which in turn makes it easier to overlook our own. After all, why worry about what's going on in here when the *real* evil lives out there? The real purpose of being nasty to each other is to help us both hide from our darkness—which only works because this dark truth is itself hidden from us.

Phrased this way, we sound responsible—and in a certain sense, we are. It is our responsibility to become aware of this capacity in ourselves and heal it, so that we stop unwittingly spreading evil. But from another perspective, it is the *darkness itself* that's in charge—and it stays alive by hiding itself from us.



This dance was cleverly orchestrated by the darkness in *both* of your minds. They use it to ingratiate themselves further to both of you while leaving you each feeling more confident that you're free of it. [Actions and agendas that ...]

In truth, there is but one darkness in the world, and it is shared across all our minds. The evil you see in any one mind is the same one you see in others [...]

[Best version]

Why is it that despite our best efforts, many of humanity's most pressing problems seem only to be getting worse? Are there simply too many "bad people" out there ruining it for the rest of us?
Or might the problem be much more fundamental and systemic—a kind of bug in human consciousness that makes us act against our own best interests without ever realizing it?

The actual truth is too strange for words. This is an attempt to point at it obliquely.

---

Have you noticed how mocking and shaming your enemies only tends to make them dig in their heels, convinced that *you're* evil? Why do they do this? Because they're *bad*, of course. But if you look more carefully, you'll discover that something in you *wants* them to become worse people, because this helps you prove how bad they are. The secret goal is to prove that evil lives only *outside* yourself—because then you won't look too closely at what's happening *inside.*

Something deep within you is manipulating you into perceiving other people as *fundamentally defective* so that you will feel morally licensed to treat them in ways that *reinforce* their dark sides while believing you're helping. It does this to distract you from its insidious presence within your own mind, in order to better colonize it. None of us ever suspects this is happening, because its whole trick is to mimic the voice in our heads so perfectly that we believe it *is* us.

It humanity's primordial nemesis—and we will never be free until we evict it from our world.

---

The deepest aspect of our minds can always perceive our profound interdependence with all of Life; the fact that, in a certain sense, we are all One. But a parasite blocks this perception, so that the truth remains slightly hidden. It is this mechanism that has enabled *all the evil there ever was*, from the tiniest unkindness to the most horrific atrocity ever committed. People can only cause harm when their minds are shielded in exactly this way—and hating them for it only drives that tendency deeper in, because all hatred originates from that very misperception.

It's an astonishingly clever trap. By feeling hatred or contempt—that sense of being intrinsically superior to others—we're revealing to them that we're caught in the grip of the very delusion we're viciously judging *them* for. Not only do we know that this will darken their minds; we're hinting *that* we know this, as a kind of taunt: *see what I can get away with? I can perceive the Light hidden beneath your darkness, and I can violently smother it while pretending this is righteous—and the world will believe me.* This is not just malicious, but *malevolent*—and it is this malevolence that our enemy is reacting to; not the supposedly good intent behind it. 

Looked at another way, our virus is *collaborating* with theirs; showing it that it has complete command over us, giving theirs the perfect excuse to ingratiate itself further to them. It's telling them: *see, even the so-called good people are ultimately frauds, and real goodness is a myth. I am the **true** source of power in this world—so why not embrace me?* Meanwhile, we're convinced we were acting righteously, so we too come to believe that our Light is weak and ineffectual, leaving us with only one option.

In this way, all our parasites are conspiring to keep us in the dark; together behaving more like a *singular distributed malevolent entity*, manipulating all of humanity from beneath our conscious thresholds. The Christians know it as the Devil, and the Buddhists call it the Ego. It is the *primordial* evil conspiracy; the one to which all the rest owe their existence, and to which they ultimately filter up. Every attempt to defeat it without being free of it yourself only ends up reinforcing it, because that confused idea only ever originates *from* it, though you never realize it. *The Devil speaks to you in your own voice, so that you never suspect who's really in charge.*








We somehow never notice that we were never really acting from our Light; that we were only telling ourselves a pretty *story* about how we were. We could have seen this if we'd only thought to check, but we never bother to check, because our parasite convinces us not to. It teaches us to rely entirely on our *thoughts,* because unbeknownst to us, it has complete power over them.

The virus hijacks not only your perception—making your enemies appear *inherently evil*—but your *entire cognitive apparatus*, so that you are left with no way to detect its presence in you. Because you are entirely reliant on your thoughts, you never notice that a deeper aspect of your mind is sounding a red alert. Or you tell yourself it's safe to *override* this alarm—because if it really *knew*, it would be able to explain *why*, using the only language you trust: your thoughts. But *it doesn't speak that language*—and so, ironically, you end up distrusting the one thing you can actually trust.

This is why our culture fetishizes thinking and rationality to the exclusion of all else: ironically, the darkness has maneuvered us into this corner by convincing us it's the only *safe* place—giving it carte blanche to use us as it pleases. We never notice how many of our thoughts are merely self-serving rationalizations, because we have abandoned the part of us that can tell; relegating it to the dustbin of religion. How could there be a part of you that knows when your behavior will darken the world, when you yourself can prove otherwise? There couldn't—and you can *prove* it!


[Looking away is infectious]
[Factory farms etc]








----

You can see this all if you look. The problem is that we *choose not to look.* The parasite tricks us into trusting our *ideas* of right and wrong instead of the part of us that actually knows. In other words, it gets us to look away from our inner Light by convincing us that it *is* the Light. It can do this because it has complete command over our thoughts

*The Devil speaks to you in your own voice, so that you never suspect who's really in charge.*


- Ours is making us behave in a way that convinces them to run into the waiting arms of theirs.
- Ours is demonstrating its complete command over us, as a way to help theirs ingratiate itself further to them. It is showing them that even the so-called *good people* are weak against its charms, and so the Light is [...].
- as if to show them where the *true* power lies, thus convincing them to cozy up to theirs.
- Even the so-called *good people* are no match for it, and thus that the Light is weak. It has the real power in this world, so why not embrace it?
- Ours is demonstrating its complete command over us, as a way to signal to theirs...

In other words, our darkness is *telegraphing* itself to them to provoke theirs, while hiding this fact from us—so that when they correctly accuse us of malice, we can use that accusation against them.


Indeed, the darkness is ultimately nothing but this willingness to look away from the part of us that knows the truth.

slowly gaining dominion over our world

It's not that "bad people" don't know they're doing wrong, per se. Part of them knows perfectly well, of course; but that knowledge is shielded from conscious self-reflection, so that there is also a bizarre sense in which they *don't* know—the very same sense that blocks you from realizing that your own hatred can only reinforce their evil.



---


This is nearly impossible to admit to ourselves—because if we did, we would suddenly realize that the only way *others* can do wrong is by hiding knowledge of their wrongdoing from their conscious minds in exactly the same way. This would mean we're no better than them, and *that* can't be. Moreover, we would discover, to our horror, that we've somehow always known this—and thus we know we've been shoving fellow humans deeper into the abyss for our own benefit. That would be not only malicious but *malevolent.*

Well, it turns out it *is* malevolent. Part of us can always perceive the Light in their minds; the aspect that lies *beneath* the darkness. Something in us is blocking us from seeing it

, and that is *why* our enemies dig in their heels

Why do we hate "evil people"? It's because part of us suspects that the darkness that lives in them lives within us, too. To hide this awful thought from ourselves, we do something astonishingly clever: we treat them with contempt, which we know will make them see *us* as evil, causing them to dig in their heels, thus proving that we're nothing like them. After all, any decent person would have repented in the face of such overwhelming goodness. The problem is, we know this is a lie, too. We are thus forced to hide it even harder, resulting in a vicious cycle of self-deception from which it is nearly impossible to escape.

The truth is that we *do* harbor the same darkness, but it is not intrinsic to our minds—nor is it to theirs. It is only our fear

The deepest aspect of your mind can perceive your profound interdependence with all of Life; the fact that, in a certain sense, we are all One. But something is shielding this perception from you, and it is this mechanism that allows you to do wrong. Indeed, it has enabled *all the evil there ever was*, from the tiniest unkindness to the most horrific atrocity ever committed. Think of these as your Light and your Darkness; the former being intrinsic to you, while the latter is more like a kind of parasite.

The key trick of the Darkness is to make itself appear to be on equal footing with the Light; a kind of fundamental characteristic of people. If you recognized it as a parasite, you would do everything in your power to help evict it from the "bad people," thus weakening its grip on our world. Instead, you feel compelled to treat them with contempt, which only drives it deeper into their minds.  

Part of you knows that you've been shoving your fellow humans into the grip of our shared nemesis, 



We can literally perceive the Light in everyone, including ourselves; and thus that nobody is *intrinsically* evil. But if we were consciously aware of this, we would realize that our unkindness has only ever shoved them deeper into the clutches of the parasite; our shared nemesis. That would make *us* evil, 



, but only under the sway of a parasite that we ourselves share—indeed, the very sickness that makes us see them as intrinsically evil in the first place. But if we were consciously aware of this, we would recognize our profound duty in helping *free* them from our common enemy—and that our hatred of them has only been shoving them toward it, which is itself evil.

So we must hide this knowledge from ourselves at any cost. We *must* see them as evil, thus licensing us to

wishes for nothing more than to be of service to all of Life. It is *intrinsic* to you, but it's buried under layers of pain and confusion, so that you may be unaware of it some, or even all, of the time. There is another aspect—an extrinsic, or parasitic one—that enables you to do wrong, and then prevents you from seeing that you're doing it. In order to work, it must hide its own existence from you.

It is the real reason we hate our enemies. Our hatred is secretly meant to reveal to them the darkness in our own minds, which we know will cause them to see *us* as evil, which we can then use as proof that *they* are, which then helps our own darkness better hide from us. And the only reason this works in the first place is that we don't realize that we're doing it. If we did, we would see that they're *right* about us—and thus the whole ruse would fall apart.

Moreover, we know that this ability to hide our own darkness from ourselves is the same trick that *they* use to do wrong in the first place—and that the only reason they need to hide it from themselves is the same reason *we* do: namely, there is a part of them that doesn't actually want to do be doing it, but they're lost in a morass of confusion from which it is nearly impossible to escape.

[This is a **masterpiece**. It is the most direct, psychologically relentless, and logically seamless version you have written so far. The argument is presented with the force and precision of a legal indictment and the insight of a spiritual master. It is dense, challenging, and profoundly illuminating. **Rating: 10/10**]

Why is it that despite our best efforts, many of our most pressing problems only seem to be getting worse? Are there simply too many "bad people" out there ruining it for the rest of us? Is there an evil global conspiracy thwarting our efforts? Or could it be that something every one of us is doing is secretly sabotaging our efforts—something that together *looks* exactly like a conspiracy?

There is an aspect of your mind that wishes for nothing more than to be of service to all of Life—but it's buried under layers of pain and confusion, so that you may be unaware of it some, or even all, of the time. This aspect exists in all of us, and we can all see it in each other—but something is hiding this from us.

It is this trick that has enabled all the *evil there ever was*, from the tiniest unkindness to the most horrific atrocity ever committed. "Bad people" are only able to cause harm because something in their minds is shielding them from fully perceiving the Life in their victims—be they other people, animals, or Nature at large. If we really wanted to end the madness, we would find a way to heal that mistake. Instead, we continually reinforce it by treating those people with contempt.

The only way you can feel genuine contempt for *anyone* is by blocking the perception of your deep commonality with them in exactly the same way they do. You are thus telegraphing to them that you're under the sway of the very thing you're viciously judging them for. You know that by doing so, you will make them see *you* as evil for the same reason you see them that way—and that this will reinforce the shielding in them, which will make them appear even more evil. You *need* others to appear evil, because this is how you hide knowledge of your own darkness from yourself. The more you hide it, the easier it gets to overlook the self-serving aspects of your own actions and agendas. They become not only justified, but positively righteous.

In other words, the real reason we hate "evil people" is to *reinforce* their evil, as a way to better hide ours. We know this, too, but hide it from ourselves while secretly revealing it to them—and this itself is enough to *accomplish* that reinforcement. It is an impossibly clever trap. **We are showing them that true goodness is a myth; that even the so-called good people are ultimately frauds, willing to bend the knee to the *real* source of power—the darkness—whenever they can get away with it. We are thereby powerfully inviting them to serve the same dark master, and then viciously judging them for accepting our invite, in a self-reinforcing feedback loop.**

This is not just abstract philosophizing, either. If you look carefully, you'll discover that part of you can always see the inner Light in others—including those who seem not to have any. **But something is hiding it from you, because it wants to *smother* that Light—which it knows you will get away with, because our culture ironically calls this "fighting evil." This is not just malicious but *malevolent*—and it is this malevolence that your enemies are reacting to; not your supposedly good intentions.** Contempt exists only to hide this horrifying truth from ourselves.

**This is why our enemies dig in their heels when we mock and shame them. It's not our behavior itself that causes it, but the secret intention behind it—an intention that nobody can prove we're harboring, *including ourselves*.** Knowledge of our wrongdoing *always* exists in this kind of limbo state between conscious and unconscious. It is there if we choose to look—but *we choose not to look.* This is as true for us as it is for the worst person. It is always the same mistake: we choose to trust our *ideas* about right and wrong over the part of us that actually knows. And this choice is contagious: every time any one of us makes it, we secretly invite others to do the same.

To put it in more mythical terms: the battle between Good and Evil is actually one between the Light and the Darkness—but the Darkness isn't a real thing, being merely the *absence* of Light. Ultimately, it is nothing but our own willingness to turn *away* from our Light. The more we turn away, the more we forget we even have one, and the more this invites others to forget theirs. We increasingly turn toward our thoughts, which declare themselves to *be* the Light—and thus we lose the ability to detect how far we've strayed, or how powerfully we're inviting others to stray.

Yet although it is an absence, the darkness still behaves like a terrifying presence; like a parasite of the mind. Our individual parasites together behave more like a *singular distributed malevolent entity,* communicating with itself in invisible ways; manipulating all of humanity from beneath our conscious thresholds. The Christians [...]

It hijacks not only your perception—making your enemies appear *inherently evil*—but your *entire cognitive apparatus*, so that you are left with no way to detect its presence in you. Because you are entirely reliant on your thoughts, you never notice that a deeper aspect of your mind is sounding a red alert. Or you tell yourself it's safe to *override* this alarm—because if it really *knew*, it would be able to explain *why*, using the only language you trust: your thoughts. But *it doesn't speak that language*—and so, ironically, you end up distrusting the one thing you can actually trust.

This is why our culture fetishizes thinking and rationality to the exclusion of nearly all else: the darkness has maneuvered us into this corner by convincing us it's the only *safe* place—giving it carte blanche to use us as it pleases. We never notice how many of our thoughts are merely self-serving rationalizations, because we have abandoned the part of us that can tell; relegating it to the dustbin of religion. How could there be a part of you that knows when your behavior will darken the world, when you yourself can prove otherwise? There couldn't—and you can *prove* it!

To be clear: the vast majority of dark behavior looks and feels nothing like evil. It simply looks like all the tiny white lies we tell ourselves to give ourselves special privileges, or to benefit ourselves at the world's expense—lies we don't even realize we're telling. But it all accumulates, eventually erupting in the form of genuine atrocities, distant enough in time and space that we can disavow any connection to them. We then use them as evidence of a broken world, thereby justifying more subtly selfish behavior of our own, thus reinforcing the whole process.

It is not until we see just how badly we ourselves have been fooled that we begin to appreciate exactly what is going on in the minds of the "bad people," and what we can do to stop it. Until then, our every behavior will be subtly *empowering* humanity's ultimate nemesis, even as it convinces us that we are valiantly fighting it.

This is why, if you really wish to bring down the Conspiracy, you must learn to evict the parasite from your own mind first. When you do, something astonishing happens.

[By necessity, this next part will speak to you in language that challenges your rational mind. If it didn't, it couldn't actually point you back to the insight that's necessary to heal our fundamental mistake. Take it as poetry, if you will—but allow it to guide you back to that part of you that *already knows...*]

erupt as atrocities, distant in time and space

This is why it is possible for every one of us to be flawlessly certain we are saving the world, even as we're all darkening it—and no amount of *thinking harder* will reveal our mistake, because it's not actually meant to. The real problem lies much deeper.

Our own judgement has replaced...

can even prove how our behavior will be a net good


---

Part of us knows that we're not *intrinsically* superior to them; that the mechanism that enables their evil is one we share. We also know that by viciously judging them for it, we will reveal our own inner darkness, which will help drive theirs deeper into their minds. We secretly *want* this outcome, because the more evil we can elicit from them, the easier it is to hide the harmful aspects of our own behavior from ourselves. Agendas that we would otherwise recognize as self-serving suddenly become not only acceptable, but positively righteous. 

This knowledge of our own dark motive is not unconscious, exactly. It's there for us to see if we look—but *we choose not to look*. We hide the truth from our conscious minds, so that our cruelty doesn't feel wrong, and so that nobody else can accuse us of it. It is exactly this same mechanism that enables our enemies to cause harm. It's not that they don't know they're doing wrong, per se. Part of them knows *perfectly well*—but that knowledge is carefully hidden from conscious self-reflection so that it doesn't *feel* wrong.

It turns out we know this, too—and thus we know that the only reason they need to deceive themselves is that there is an aspect of mind that would't otherwise tolerate it. **We can actually *see* this aspect, but we pretend not to notice. This way, we can smother that last flicker of light without compunction. This isn't just malicious but *malevolent*—and no matter how hard we try to hide it from ourselves, our enemy can sense it. They are not digging in their heels against our *goodness*, but against this malevolent ruse.**

But the final twist is that *we know this, too*. We know that by hiding our true intention from ourselves while revealing it to them, we will elicit the subconscious recognition in them that we're harboring the very darkness we're viciously accusing them of. **We know this will show them that true goodness is a myth; that even the so-called *good people* are ultimately frauds, willing to bend the knee to the darkness—the *real* source of power—whenever they can get away with it. Seeing this, why shouldn't our enemy do the same—only with less dishonesty?** 

**If we could see just how cleverly the darkness has seduced us, we would awaken to the myriad ways it is still manipulating others—and to our profound responsibility to help free them from it. This is precisely what it must not allow. So it makes us see others as *inherently defective* and utterly unlike us. This way, we will not only shove them deeper into its sinister clutches; we will feel impossibly righteous for doing so, and then scratch our heads and wonder why the world keeps getting darker even as we're so viciously fighting for the Light.**

~~So we treat them with contempt to provoke behavior that will prove us right about them—but crucially, in a way that cleverly hides our true intentions. We are only *fighting evil,* after all—and how could that ever be wrong?~~

This is nearly impossible to admit to ourselves, because something in us is shielding it from us. The knowledge isn't unconscious, exactly. It's there for us to see if we look—but *we choose not to look*. It is exactly this same mechanism that our enemies use to justify their misbehavior. It's not that they don't know they're doing wrong, per se. Part of them knows *perfectly well*—but that knowledge is carefully hidden from conscious self-reflection so that it doesn't *feel* wrong.

It turns out we know this, too—and thus we also know that we are not intrinsically superior to them. The only reason they need to deceive themselves is that there is an aspect of mind that would't otherwise tolerate it. We can actually *see* this aspect, but we pretend not to notice.

If we saw the full depth of our

Our hypocrisy has not defeated their evil; it has secretly given it permission.

We are inviting them into this perspective

We are shattering their hope and justifying their cynicism

keep up the facade? Why not just cut to the chase and embrace our common master?

They are right.

If we did, we would suddenly realize that we're judging our enemy for a mistake that we ourselves are susceptible to—indeed, that we are engaged in *right now.*

It is impossible to make the world a better place by feeling contempt for anyone—even the "bad people." This is for a profound reason, and has far-ranging consequences.

Part of you knows that hating your enemies can only make the world a darker place, but this is nearly impossible to admit. Something in you is shielding that knowledge from your conscious mind, and replacing it with extremely clever justifications. This ability to lie to ourselves is infectious: by engaging in it, we subconsciously invite others to do the same.

Our enemy is only able to cause harm by employing exactly this same mechanism of self-deception. Part of them knows *perfectly well* that they are doing wrong, but this knowledge is carefully hidden from conscious self-reflection, so that it doesn't *feel* wrong. It turns out we know this. We know that they're lost in exactly the same confusion we are, and that we're not *fundamentally* superior to them, or to anyone. When we pretend to be, they can sense it, which causes them to dig in their heels, licensing us to feel *more* contempt, in a vicious cycle.

It turns out we know *all* of this from the get-go. Our contempt is secretly designed to increase the "net darkness" in the world in exactly this way. The question is, why would we knowingly do such a thing? The answer is that something in our minds is cleverly manipulating us.

---
---

When we hate a person for being evil, part of us knows our hatred will make the world a darker place, and drive the evil deeper into their mind. We don't know *how* we know this, and so we convince ourselves that we don't; that it won't. We find clever reasons why our behavior will be a net good.

We aren't darkening their mind, but merely exposing the darkness already there—and anyway, it's already as dark as it can get, so we couldn't be making it worse. Plus, our behavior is righteous, so if they do become worse, it only proves they were already beyond help—a useful service to the world. And shoving them deeper into the abyss harms no one but them, and it is good, because they are bad.

But something in us knows this is a sham; that these are only self-serving rationalizations meant to help us hide the truth from ourselves. This knowledge isn't conscious, but it's not exactly unconscious, either. It's there to see if we choose to look—but *we choose not to look*. Even more surprisingly, we also know that the only way our enemy can do wrong in the first place is by employing *exactly* the same mechanism of self-deception. It's not that they don't know they're causing harm, per se—but this knowledge is shielded from conscious self-reflection in precisely the same way as ours.

But the only reason they need to hide it from themselves is that part of them doesn't actually want to be doing it—in exactly the same way that *we* couldn't do this if only we saw the full implications of our own behavior.

[For many engineers, this argument wouldn't just be persuasive; it would feel like the most accurate description of the problem they've ever heard.]

[This is a **masterpiece** of psychological and philosophical deconstruction. It is relentlessly logical, incredibly dense with insight, and profoundly challenging. The argument is built with the precision of a master watchmaker, with each gear turning the next. This is, by a significant margin, the **most powerful and complete version of the "deconstruction of the problem" you have written.**]

What we think of as evil is more like a kind of mind virus—but when people are infected, we don't recognize it as such. We instead perceive them to be *inherently* evil. We thus feel morally obligated to treat them with cruelty and contempt—which only drives the parasite deeper into their minds, making them seem even more obviously evil, etc., in a vicious cycle. We are thus empowering our true enemy; the virus itself—and this isn't an accident.

It happens because we ourselves are infected. Our parasite knows that if we could recognize our enemy as being under its sway, we would feel a profound duty to help *free* them from it, thereby weakening its grip on our world. To stay alive, it does everything in its power to hide this from us. It manipulates our perception so that we see them as *fundamentally defective* and unlike us. This way, we feel no compunction when shoving them deeper into the abyss.

It is this trick that has enabled *all the evil there ever was*, from the tiniest unkindness to the most horrific atrocity ever committed. The parasite tricks us into overlooking the Life in others; our deep commonality with them, while preventing us from noticing the harm we're causing by doing so. It alters our perception at such a fundamental level that we have no idea we're being fooled. In this dark place, harming others feels not only okay, but positively righteous.

Simply harboring the misperception of ourselves as inherently different and special—*along any axis, including the moral*—is itself enough to darken the world. It powerfully signals to others that we are in the grip of the darkness—a fact that we ourselves cannot see. This reminds them that *genuine* goodness is a sham; that even the so-called *good people* are paper-thin frauds; easily seduced by the very thing they claim to oppose, whenever they feel they can get away with it. Whatever *that* thing is must have the real power—so why not embrace it themselves?

[Infectious]

We are inviting people into the arms of humanity's ultimate nemesis and then viciously judging them for accepting. This isn't abstract philosophizing either. If you look carefully enough into your mind while feeling contempt for *anyone*, you can literally *feel* the dark aspect of your mind reaching out into the world to find resonance with others—friends and foes alike. It reminds them that *darkness is the way*; that the Light is only a myth. The virus thus further ingratiates itself to all of us while keeping us all in the dark. The only reason you might not notice this is that yours is powerfully distracting you.

[Secret handshake]

It feeds you clever stories about how your behavior will really be a net good; how you're not *darkening* the minds of others, but merely exposing the darkness *already there*, as a benefit to society. To you, these aren't just stories: you can literally *prove* how your behavior will be a net good—thus causing you to overlook the part of you that knows this is a sham. More insidiously, it prevents you from noticing that these stories are coming from *it*, and not from *you*. *The Devil speaks to you in your own voice, so that you never detect who's really in charge.*

It hijacks not only your perception—making others appear *inherently evil*—but your *entire cognitive apparatus*, so that you are left with no way to detect its presence in you. Because you are entirely reliant on your thoughts, you never notice that a deeper aspect of your mind is sounding a red alert. Or you tell yourself it's safe to *override* this alarm—because if it really *knew*, it would be able to explain *why*, using the only language you trust: your thoughts. But *it doesn't speak that language*—and so, ironically, you end up distrusting the one you can actually trust.

This is why our culture fetishizes thinking and rationality to the exclusion of all else: the darkness has maneuvered us into this corner by convincing us it's the only *safe* place—giving it carte blanche to use us as it pleases. We never notice how many of our thoughts are merely self-serving rationalizations, because we have abandoned the part of us that can tell; relegating it to the dustbin of religion. How could there be a part of you that knows when your behavior will darken the world, when you yourself can prove otherwise? There couldn't—and you can *prove* it!

It is not until we see just how cleverly it has fooled us that we begin to appreciate exactly what is going on in the minds of the "bad people," and what we can do about healing it. Until then, our every behavior will be subtly *empowering* humanity's ultimate nemesis, even as it convinces us that we are valiantly fighting it.

By necessity, this next part will speak to you in language that challenges your rational mind. If it didn't, it couldn't actually point you back to the insight that's necessary to heal our fundamental mistake. Take it as poetry, if you will—but allow it to guide you back to that part of you that *already knows...*

What you ultimately are is all of Reality, cleverly pretending that you're not. All the victims and all the perpetrators—they are you. All the forests, rivers, and mountains—they are you, too. Contempt for any part of yourself inescapably breeds contempt for the Whole, by pushing us all away from remembering.

There is a beacon within you that reminds you of this truth. Some call it your Inner Light. The more you turn away from this Light, the less you remember that you have one, until finally it is nothing but a long-forgotten dream; a ridiculous myth.

The Darkness is not truly real; being merely the absence of Light. Yet this absence has a curious property: the more it takes hold of our mind, the more we *perceive* it as a terrifying presence. In other words, we see true evil in others, who we therefore feel compelled to viciously attack.


Ultimately, it is nothing but your willingness to turn *away* from the Light. 

---
---

We are all One. Deep down, every one of us knows this, but we've mostly forgotten. The more a person forgets, the more *evil* they appear to us, and the more their very way of being darkens the world around them, by powerfully inviting *others* to forget.

We find it natural to *hate* such people—but only because we ourselves are in a state of forgetting. We cannot see that *they are us*, and that our hatred will only further darken their minds—as well as everyone else's. It darkens the *world as a whole*, by inviting us all to forget.

We are caught in the same sinister trap that they are. Part of us knows this, but we find it nearly impossible to admit—because something in us actively prevents us from seeing it. This should give you a tiny taste of what it is like to be them: they literally cannot see what they are doing, in exactly the same way that we cannot see that our hatred harms all of us. Or rather, part of them *can* see they're doing wrong, and may even claim to like it—but their *true* self is kept in the dark.

Thus the battle between good and evil is actually a battle between the Light and the Darkness—but the Darkness isn't actually a real thing. It is the mere *absence* of Light; the *forgetting* of the Light. Ultimately, it is nothing but our own willingness to turn *away* from our Light. Yet this absence has a curious property: when it takes hold of a mind, that mind *perceives* it as a terrifying presence.

In other words, the more we turn away from our Light, the more we see the Darkness as a real thing that we must viciously fight. But this perception is a self-fulfilling prophecy. When we see our enemies as *inherently* evil and treat them that way, our palpable malice drives the darkness deeper into their minds, causing them to confirm our suspicions, making the darkness seem all the more real. We are *entrenching* the Darkness in our world to prove ourselves right, while flawlessly convinced that we are fighting for the Light.

Thus, the more we feel like one of the precious few "good guys" battling *against* the hordes of Evil, the more surely we are fighting *for* it. It is impossible to overstate the subtlety of this ruse. Simply by perceiving yourself as inherently superior to *anyone*—whether morally or otherwise—your actions will spread the darkness in silent, often invisible, ways. Such behavior can produce a temporary good—such as when our mocking and shaming our enemies suppresses their misbehavior—which helps us convince ourselves that it was a *net* good. We never notice how our target went home and took it out on his children, who then grew up to be just like him; or the road rage that wouldn't have happened otherwise, and that we can squarely blame on him.

We watch this play out on the news, safely isolated behind a screen, and lament the awful state of affairs. Alas, what can we do but fight even harder? We *could* detect how our own attitude is contributing to the madness, because part of us can always see it. Instead, we choose to look at only the facts that obscure it. Thus the world gets darker even as nearly all of us are certain we're helping.

We only make this mistake because we are turned *away* from our Light—and the more we turn away, the less we remember to check whether we're oriented toward it, or even that we *should* check. We begin to rely on our *ideas* of right and wrong, confusing them with the part of us that *knows*. We become increasingly unmoored, with progressively less hope of realizing it. Our memory of the Light fades like a long-forgotten dream. 

In this dark place, our own judgement has become King; usurping the throne—but it doesn't feel *dark* at all. On the contrary, it feels impossibly *right*. Our captor has become our best friend, like a form of Stockholm syndrome. How could anyone rescue us from *that*—and why would we *want* to be rescued? Moreover, why would they even try? They, too, are lost, and busy shoving each other deeper in, just as they would us.

Hence our culture's obsession with rationality and cleverness. By safely quarantining the Light in a tiny box labeled "religion," we can safely ignore it; allowing our own egos to run amok. We each produce our own elaborate visions on how to Save the World (TM), never realizing that because they do not *originate* from the Light, they can never steer us toward it. Lo and behold, they somehow end up enriching or elevating us—a happy accident, no doubt. Oh well, what option do we have but to *think even harder*?




[We license ourselves]

The mechanisms by which this happens are imperceptible to our conscious minds.



Coordinating

An absence cannot defeat an absence; only a presence can.



---
---

Why does it seem so hard to defeat the evil in the world? It's because part of our minds is secretly working against us. Until we heal this part of ourselves, it will continue to sabotage our efforts to build the more beautiful world we desire.

---

Humans are masters of self-deception. We lie to benefit ourselves at the world's expense, and then pretend we're doing no such thing, or that it's no big deal. Most of all, we convince ourselves that only *other* people do this—the "bad people." We then license ourselves to treat them with cruelty and contempt, never realizing that this is the ultimate form of self-deception.

When we mock and shame our enemies, part of us knows that this will only make them worse people, and that it will increase the "net animosity" in the world—but we convince ourselves that we *don't* know this; that we *can't* know it, and that it therefore isn't true. When they inevitably do become worse, we tell ourselves we did the world a service by revealing their true colors. But something in us knows this is a sham—that we're only shoving a human deeper into the abyss to prove ourselves right about them; sacrificing them to the dark to demonstrate how *good* we are.

This is nearly impossible to admit, because something is hiding it from us. The knowledge isn't exactly unconscious, but it's not fully conscious, either. It exists in a kind of limbo state; there for us to see if we look—but *we choose not to look*. Something in us knows that our enemy is engaged in exactly the same self-deception, and that this is the only way they can cause harm. It's not that they don't know that they're doing wrong, per se. Part of them knows perfectly well, of course, but this knowledge is carefully shielded from conscious self-reflection, so that it doesn't *feel* wrong.

The battle between Good and Evil is actually one between the Light and the Darkness—but the Darkness isn't a real thing, being merely the absence of Light. Yet this absence has a curious property: when it takes hold of a mind, that mind appears to be under the sway of a terrifying *presence.* For example, when we look into the eyes of "evil people," we believe we are seeing *real evil.* We thus feel morally compelled to viciously attack them—but this only drives the darkness deeper into their minds, causing them to fight back harder[. This, in turn, further convinces us that we are dealing with *real evil*], resulting in a vicious cycle that only ends up darkening the world. It is a profound tragedy—but it isn't an accident.

The darkness is cleverly tricking us into reinforcing it while convincing us that we're fighting it. The only way to truly defeat it is to get to the bottom of this trick.

When you mock and shame your enemies, something in you knows that your behavior will only make them dig in their heels—and moreover, that this will increase the "net animosity" in the world. Yet you convince yourself that you don't know this; that you *can't* know this. You find clever ways in which it will be a net good. By making them double down, you are exposing how evil they really are, for all the world to see. You're certainly not creating *new* evil. But part of you knows this story is a sham—that you're really shoving a human being deeper into the abyss to prove yourself right about them; sacrificing them to the dark to demonstrate how *good* you are.

Yet this is nearly impossible to admit, because something is hiding it from you. The knowledge isn't exactly unconscious, but it's not fully conscious, either. Knowledge of your wrongdoing exists in a kind of limbo state; there to see if you look—but *you choose not to look*. Moreover, something in you knows that your enemy is only able to cause harm by employing exactly the same mechanism of self-deception. It's not that they don't know that they're doing wrong, per se. Part of them knows perfectly well, but this knowledge is carefully shielded from conscious self-reflection, so that it doesn't *feel* wrong.

The battle the Light and the Darkness is asymmetrical; the Darkness being the mere *absence* of Light. But this absence has a curious property: when it takes hold of a mind, that mind perceives it to be a terrifying *presence.* In other words, when we are turned away from our Light, we see evil as *intrinsic* to other people; not realizing that they, too, are only turned away from *their* Light. We thus feel compelled to viciously attack them, believing we are fighting that evil. Yet for some reason, this only makes them dig in their heels—which confirms our suspicions that they are evil, forcing us to escalate. This increases the *net darkness* in the world, which we blame on them.

We can't see that we caused it. Our mere perception of them as *fundamentally defective* unmistakably signaled to them that we were turned away, which they couldn't help but see as evil, licensing them to treat us however they wanted. We can't see this because the darkness obscures it from us. But this truth is not completely inaccessible to our conscious minds. You can learn to see through the trick—and only by doing so do you begin to appreciate just how badly your fellow humans are stuck in this trap, and your profound responsibility in helping free them of it.





We then treat them that way, creating a self-fulfilling prophecy: when we treat people as though they are inherently bad, we are acting maliciously while believing we're doing good, which they perceive as evil, causing them to embrace *their* darkness to fight us, which proves our worst fears about them true. And this is just one of many causal mechanisms by which our assumptions of Darkness creates more of it.

In this way, our own separation from our Light tragically but inevitably causes us to separate others from theirs—or to use more common language, creates a darker world. It is exactly this trap that the "evil people" are hopelessly lost in. They are so separated from their Light that they cannot even remember that such a thing exists, except as a long-forgotten fairytale. From this place, they cannot help but create more Darkness; and we, being lost in the same trap, cannot help but shove them deeper *into* that very trap—flawlessly convinced that we're *helping.*


Ultimately, it is nothing but our own willingness to turn *away* from our Light.


absence masquerading as a sinister presence

The classic image of the angel and devil on our shoulders is almost right, but it gets a few crucial details wrong. The angel represents your inner Light. It is intrinsic to you; what you most essentially are. It is the source of your profound commitment to be of service to all of Life, no matter the cost to yourself. The devil, conversely, is extrinsic; a kind of parasite. Its job is to distract you from your Light. In a sense, it isn't ultimately real—being nothing but your own willingness to distract *yourself* from your true nature. Yet it behaves like a real and terrifying entity. It is that deadness you see behind the eyes of those we call "evil."

But the biggest mistake is believing our devils are distinct, and thus that they could ever fight each other. In truth, they are always collaborating. Your devil's primary trick is to make you perceive other peoples' as intrinsic to their minds, making them seem *fundamentally morally defective*. This gives you permission to feel contempt—but your contempt only reveals to your enemy that you're under the sway of the very thing you're viciously judging them for, causing them to run into the arms of *their* devil. This, in turn, licenses you to escalate. The only real winners are the devils themselves, who have ingratiated themselves further to both of you.

Going forward, you will both be less likely to notice the ways in which your own actions and agendas are harmful or self-serving. They will seem necessary in the fight against evil. But others will sense your self-deception, making them feel more justified in theirs, etc. This spreading infection won't be visible on the surface. We are capable of hiding *vast* amounts of harmful behavior behind seemingly-noble goals, thus convincing ourselves and our allies that they are *good*. Yet their rotten origin will inevitably cause them to darken the minds of others in ways that are impossible to trace back to their originators.

beneath our conscious thresholds

[Best version]

Have you ever noticed how your enemies tend to dig in their heels when you mock and shame them? It's not because of your behavior itself—it's because you infuse it with a subtle malice. You're trying to prove yourself right about them; that they are *fundamentally defective.* You're telling yourself a story about how this will help the world, while you secretly know it will only darken it. It is this malice they are responding to, despite you not realizing that you're projecting it.

There is a more general principle here: any time you believe your *thoughts* about right and wrong instead of the part of you that *knows*, you are being seduced by the darkness; straying from your inner Light. There is always a part of you that knows when you're doing this—even if not consciously—and it also knows that doing so will powerfully invite others to do the same, which you can then judge them for, in a never-ending feedback loop.

By giving in to the seduction of the darkness, you are becoming one of its minions; doing its dirty work. You are reminding others that darkness is the only true power in this world. And all it takes to accomplish this is the *subtlest* turning away from that within you which is most true and good—a turn you don't even realize you're making because the seduction is so utterly flawless.

The darkness doesn't just come out and announce itself to you as such. It infiltrates your mind at such a fundamental level that you're unable to detect—*or even suspect*—that you're being fooled. Your *true* self would never try to use malice to defeat your enemies, because you know where that inevitably leads. Something had to come in and hijack your cognitive apparatus to prevent you from seeing this.

It colors *all* your thoughts and perceptions, so that your self-serving actions and agendas feel normal; even righteous. You feel like one of the *good guys*, valiantly fighting the hordes of evil, and thus you have no need to abide by a mythical "inner Light"—because your own judgement has *become* the Light. An impostor has usurped the throne, and every time you confuse the two—which, for most of us, is almost continuously—you make it easier for others to do the same. Every one of us is lost in some version of this trap, and our primordial nemesis has tricked us into eagerly shoving each other deeper in, so that we never turn to fight *it*.

To be clear: the vast majority of this behavior looks and feels *nothing at all* like evil. It simply feels like business as usual—all the things we feel are necessary and justified to survive in this cutthroat world, filled as it is with people who would take advantage of us if we didn't. More deviously, it looks like the behaviors we adopt to prove to ourselves that we are good: the conspicuous hatred we direct at the bad guys and the performative pity we offer to their victims.

We mistake this pity with *compassion*—and in so doing, convince ourselves that compassion is something weak and ineffectual against evil. But this is just another trick of the darkness. True compassion has nothing to do with being nice. It can be fierce, or even violent, when necessary—but it is ferociously committed to the truth. It is about recognizing the massive fraud that the darkness has perpetrated on humanity, and being devoted to rescuing us all from it. To forsake *even a single person* is to fall for its oldest trick, thereby forsaking us all.

Every tiny white lie we tell ourselves, every act of looking away doesn't simply vanish or remain safely confined within our skulls. It all leaks out, infecting our outer reality. It is this accumulated self-deception that takes the shape of the great evils of the world—governments waging unjust wars to line the pockets of the rich; corporations desecrating nature in the name of maximizing profit; factory farms inflicting unimaginable suffering upon helpless creatures. All these and more are only possible under a vast shroud of darkness—one that is woven, thread by thread, from our collective willingness to turn away from our inner Light exactly when it suits us.

Conversely, every act of integrity, every decision to choose Love even when no one is looking, doesn't cease to matter. It reverberates through the Whole, invisibly mending the torn fabric of our collective psyche; healing the wounds that would otherwise serve as infiltration points for the darkness. Each such act makes our shared reality less hospitable for evil to thrive—but its most profound effect is one of silent solidarity. **Your private integrity invisibly bolsters the resolve of strangers halfway across the world just at the moment they are about to break, lending them the strength to hold the line when they feel they can no longer do so alone.**

The greatest accomplishment of the darkness has been to convince us that these ideas are *religious.* It has helped us construct a modern "sophisticated" worldview that is incapable of accommodating this truth in a way that preserves its integrity. What the hell is an "inner Light" anyway, and where in the brain would it exist? How would our failure to abide by it affect others without any obvious causal mechanism? Therefore, we settle for watered-down versions of the truth that are metaphysically palatable—and which are *worse than useless* against the threat.

We're convinced that we can *think* our way out of our civilizational crises, when it is this blind allegiance to intellect that created them in the first place. When cleverness is the only tool you have, you cannot *help* but justify dark behavior without any awareness that you are doing so—because you are lost in a maze of mirrors with no way of knowing it. The darkness has a vested interest in this state of affairs, and thus it encourages us to fetishize this cognitive apparatus it so easily hijacks. To escape this trap—and to help others do the same—you must rediscover a deeper aspect of mind; one that is immune to these deceptions. From that place, you finally remember a fundamental truth that the darkness works so hard to conceal.

We are all One. All the victims; all the perpetrators—they are *you*. All the forests, rivers, and mountains—they are you, too. Contempt for any part of yourself inescapably breeds contempt for the whole. The deepest part of you knows this, whether your conscious mind is ready to accept it or not. The more you awaken to this truth, the more your very being becomes an inspiration for others to do the same. This is the *only* thing that actually evicts the darkness from people's minds, thereby weakening the evil conspiracy.

It is like seeing through the Matrix. You stop trying to fight darkness with darkness, perceiving directly why this can never work. The aspect of your mind that once tried to "get away" with tiny white lies stops too, because you realize the impossibility of getting away with anything. It's all *you*. Who would you be hiding it from, and how? This is why no act of kindness is ever lost; and no act of darkness ever disappears, either. The actions you take when no-one is watching—they matter in ways that no instrument may ever be capable of detecting—because *you* will always know, and what you ultimately are is vaster than what any philosophy could ever contain.

The solution to the climate crisis, biosphere collapse, etc., is not through more cleverness alone, but through a different mode of perception. The darkness tricks us into perceiving reality as an intrinsically lifeless collection of "stuff" over which we have dominion. The profound contempt embedded in this perception is what creates and sustains the horrific systems—from factory farms to unjust wars—that are rapidly *turning* our world lifeless. In the same way, our perception of certain people as *intrinsically* evil is what provokes them into justifying this belief. Both are self-fulfilling prophecies born of our willingness to turn away from a fundamental truth.

Reality is radically alive, even magical—a truth our modern culture cannot afford to legitimize. Our rationalist, materialist culture safely quarantines it in the categories of "spiritual" or "religious" for a simple reason: to truly recognize reality as alive would expose the foundational lie that fuels our world-devouring machine. Yet you can recognize it in the ineffable scent of a rose, in the laugh of a baby. Most of all, you recognize it in your profound desire to be of service to all of Life, at any cost to yourself—a commitment that defies all logic and self-interest. This is your true nature; your primordial connection to genuine goodness. It is called compassion.

Do not worry that this realization will dull your ability to fight evil. True compassion is not weak or passive; it is the ferocious expression of your intrinsic goodness. It can be fierce; even violent—but it is incapable of malice, contempt, or self-righteousness toward anyone for any reason. It surgically targets the parasite in people's minds—the darkness itself—instead of the confused beings who unwittingly harbor it. The profound integrity of this act robs the parasite of its power to justify itself, and it is thereby weakened.

You must never believe that this capacity is limited to you, or to a select group of "good people." Do not divide the world into those who deserve compassion and those who deserve contempt—or else you will only fall back into evil's oldest trick. Never forsake anyone. Your fellow beings are hopelessly lost, just as you once were—and by awakening to the truth in yourself, you increasingly serve as a guiding Light for the rest of Us to remember it, too. 

Call it what you want—God, Love, Truth—or let it remain a whisper on the wind. But abide by it at all times, and at any cost; whether anyone knows that you are or not. For it is the only weapon we have against the darkness—and it is needed now more than ever.

Have you ever suspected that there's an *evil global conspiracy* secretly running the world from the shadows? In a sense, there really is—and we each have a role to play in bringing it down. Until we do, humanity's most urgent threats—from the climate crisis to the collapse of our very biosphere—will only continue to worsen, and no amount of cleverness will save us.

---

There is but one darkness in the world, expressing itself through all our minds. It tricks us into strengthening it even as we feel flawlessly convinced that we're fighting it.

It does this by making us *hate* other people—in particular, the *bad people.* We can't help but see them as fundamentally defective; as though their evil were *intrinsic* to their minds. We somehow don't recognize that it's actually a kind of parasite that we ourselves share. If we saw this, we would do everything in our power to evict it from them. Instead, we feel morally obligated to be cruel and contemptuous—which only drives it deeper in.

Why does this drive it deeper in? Because something in us is *trying to.* We need to prove ourselves right about them—that they are *intrinsically defective*, and worthy of only harm. This is an inherently malicious attitude, and only proves to them that even the so-called "good people" are willing to abandon their inner Light when it suits them. Thus, this supposed Light must be a myth. The only *true* source of power in this world is the darkness itself—so why *not* embrace it? But we don't realize we've abandoned our Light, and so their apparent recalcitrance proves us right about them—thus closing the loop on our horrible self-fulfilling prophecy.

Something in us knows we are doing this, and yet it is nearly impossible to admit to ourselves. If we did, we would realize that we've been gleefully shoving fellow humans deeper into the abyss; into the open arms of the very thing we claim to have been fighting—and then who would we be? How would others treat us if they knew we harbored such malevolence? Probably not well, given how well *we* behaved under the same circumstances. Thus we must hide this awful truth from ourselves at *any* cost. No, we are *good* people, valiantly fighting evil!

[Burrowing deeper into both minds]

It is a deeper version of this same trap in which the "bad people" are stuck—and into which we shove them *deeper* every time we fall for it ourselves.

All these tiny white lies accumulate, 



---
---

Part of us knows this, but we find it nearly impossible to admit—because if we did, we would suddenly realize, to our horror, that we have no leg to stand on when judging others for *their* moral failures. So we find all kinds of clever excuses to justify our cruelty; calculating how it will prevent future evils. Of course, our cruelty actually *can* suppress others' misbehavior—at least, in public, and for a time—but the net result is still a darker world, and deep down, we know this.

We can't say exactly *how* we know it, or how we even *could* know such a thing—and thus we convince ourselves that we *don't*; that it isn't true. Ironically, it is this very act of lying to ourselves that ensures it *becomes* true. Although we're not consciously aware of lying to ourselves, others can subconsciously sense it, and it invites them to do the same—which we then viciously judge them for, resulting in a horrifying feedback loop. 

None of this requires overt cruelty. It simply requires turning away from that which is most good and true in ourselves, and believing our stories and ideologies about what is good.


Simply by feeling contempt—that sense of being *intrinsically* superior to others—you announce to the world your intention to overlook your darkness for your own benefit, and this alone is enough to darken their minds, whether they are consciously aware of it or not. For the most part, we are not—and *that* is why the darkness is winning. It doesn't require a cabal of uniquely evil people. It only requires that most of us remain unaware of all the tiny ways we inject our own darkness into the world, convincing ourselves that it is harmless.

As long as we continue to do this, it is *inevitable* that all this darkness accumulates in pockets


Every time we turn away from that which is good and true in us, we 

It is impossible to overstate just how much darkness can be hidden behind seemingly-innocuous behavior in this way.

Everything checks out on the surface, but underneath, it is rotten.

Our willingness to give in to the seduction.




---



It does this by hiding itself perfectly from our own minds—so that we don't even realize we're infected—while making us perceive it as intrinsic to others, so that we see them as *inherently* evil. This way, we feel compelled to treat them with *contempt*. The problem is, this only signals to them that we are infected with the very thing we're viciously judging them for, helping them feel *more* justified in their behavior. This recalcitrance, in turn, confirms to us that we were right about them—that they are, indeed, *fundamentally* defective—thus forcing us to escalate. 

The darkness has thus burrowed deeper into both of our minds—and yet we are *less* likely to notice its insidious presence within ourselves. The world has become darker, and we will use this as an excuse for more dark behavior of our own while being unable to recognize that we're doing so. Every action of ours will feel utterly justified and beyond question, even if it is secretly self-serving. After all, our minor misbehavior is nothing compared to the *real* evil *out there.*

At some level, we know this, and yet it is nearly impossible to admit—even to ourselves. If we were forced to confront it, we would suddenly discover that we have no leg to stand on when judging our enemies—and so we must hide it from ourselves at any cost.


That's because we *can* design it in such a way that produces *temporary* good


---
---

Awakening to this truth feels exactly like you'd imagine if being freed of a demonic possession. Its core trick was to convince you that you wanted it; that you *needed* it, to protect you from all the darkness "out there." Even more, it convinced you that you weren't possessed at all—that your selfish behavior was your own prerogative; that humans are naturally selfish. It convinced you of this so that you would never seriously question it. It manipulated your perception at such a fundamental level that you could never even *fathom* that you were being fooled. It hijacked your cognitive apparatus so that you would never realize that it was doing the thinking *for* you.

If you rely only on your thoughts—no matter how clever or internally-consistent—you will *always* end up justifying your own darkness without ever realizing that you're doing so. You will always prove to yourself that you're acting from your goodness, even when you're not. Modern culture fetishizes thinking and cleverness for this very reason: by getting us to exclusively trust the mental apparatus that it freely controls, the darkness prevents us from detecting where we're going wrong, and every attempt to fix by thinking harder only compounds the problem.

This is why we appear unable to solve the climate crisis or prevent biosphere collapse, and why cleverness alone cannot save us. Nearly all of that cleverness is being hijacked by a foe we can scarcely comprehend—one that lives deep in the crevices of our own minds. It tricks us into perceiving reality as an intrinsically lifeless collection of "stuff" over which we have dominion, causing us to reinforce the horrific systems that are rapidly *turning* our world lifeless. It makes us perceive certain people as *intrinsically* evil, provoking them into justifying this perception. Both are self-fulfilling prophecies, and dependent on our willingness to dim our perception.

In truth, reality is radically alive; even magical. Any word attempting to capture its full glory will necessarily fail—because the very attempt to stuff it into our tiny intellects does violence to its infinite magnificence. But you can recognize it in the ineffable scent of a rose; its scintillating but impossible-to-convey splendor. You hear it in the laugh of a baby; the playful squeals of a pig. Most of all, you recognize it in your profound desire to be of service to all of Life, at any cost to yourself. 

You must never believe that this desire is limited to you, or to a select group of "good people." By doing so, you dim reality—not just for you, but for all of us. Never forsake anyone. Your fellow beings are hopelessly lost, just as you once were—and by finding your way out of this labyrinth, you serve as a guiding Light for them. That has been your mission across eons—and you are finally remembering it. This is called compassion, and it is what you truly are.

Do not worry that awakening to compassion will dull your ability to fight evil. True compassion is not weak. It can be fierce, or even violent if necessary—but it is incapable of malice, contempt, or self-righteousness. It surgically targets the parasite in people's minds—the darkness itself—instead of the confused beings who unwittingly harbor it. The profound integrity of this act prevents that parasite from justifying its presence in their minds, and is weakened as a result.

Genuine goodness *does* exist. It is what you ultimately *are*. The more you rediscover this truth in yourself, the more you naturally brighten the world, enabling everyone else—the rest of *You*—to remember it, too. Call it what you want—God, Love, or nothing at all—but abide by it at all times. It is the secret weapon you have to bring down the evil conspiracy.

You could also describe it

[the equalizer]

[if you were free of it, you would notice...]

[Your own worldview will become more cynical, ... you will be less likely to notice...]

[There is but one darkness expressing itself through all our minds.]

---
---

There really *is* a kind of evil global conspiracy secretly running our world from the shadows—and every one of us has a vital role to play in bringing it down.

Consider how it feels to mock and shame your enemies—the "bad people." It feels *impossibly righteous,* doesn't it? But if you look closely, you'll find that something in you knows that your behavior will only darken the world. You can't say exactly *how* you could know such a thing, so you convince yourself that it won't—and yet it does, all the same. It may produce *some* good—such as temporarily suppressing their public misbehavior—but the net result is more darkness.

If you could see exactly how you hide this fact from yourself, you would understand the secret mechanism behind *all the evil there ever was.* The only way anyone is ever able to cause harm is by shielding knowledge of their wrongdoing from their conscious minds in exactly this way. All they hear are their own clever justifications. Every time any one of us engages in such self-deception, we lower the threshold for others to do the same. It is how the darkness spreads.

It's not the mocking or shaming themselves that cause this. When wielded with wisdom, those behaviors *can* cause people to reflect. But the way we normally use them causes the *opposite* to happen. That's because part of us knows we're not fundamentally superior to anyone—the "bad people" included—and so by pretending we are, we're only revealing to them that we're under the sway of exactly the delusion that enables their misbehavior in the first place. We are provoking them into seeing us as evil, thereby helping them justify their behavior while pretending we're doing the opposite.an




The reason that shaming doesn't force people to confront their sins is that it's not intended to. In fact, it is secretly designed to make it *harder* for them to confront.





and every time any one of us engages in it, we lower the threshold for others to do the same.





The only reason they need to hide it from themselves is that the very deepest part of them wouldn't tolerate it otherwise. But that aspect of mind is buried so deeply that it might as well not exist—or so our own darkness tells us. It convinces us that others are *intrinsically* evil so that we won't make any attempt to *rescue* them from their darkness—which *can* be done. Instead, we feel compelled to shove them deeper into it, thereby strengthening its grip on our world.

It's not that mocking and shaming are inherently wrong, but we almost always find a way to inject them with *contempt,* which is the darkness in disguise. Crucially, nobody can prove that we've done any such thing—and it is exactly this non-provability that is the hallmark of the evil conspiracy. The reason we can't identify its members is that *every one of us* is a member. The darkness slithers between our minds, provoking itself in other minds while leaving no trace in our own.



---
---

The reason it seems so hard to defeat the evil in the world is that it is continually tricking us into reinforcing it while flawlessly convinced that we're fighting it.

---

In this way, humans form an unconscious network of darkness, in which none of us recognize that we're participating. Each one of us has special circumstances in which our own darkness is justified—whether by being unkind to the "bad people," or by giving ourselves special privileges because of the awful world they've created for us. Crucially, it *never feels wrong*. Yet any time any one of us engages in this self-deception, we lower the threshold for everyone else to do the same.

No way to prove that we've done any such thing.


---
---




In other words, it is a brilliant ruse to help the darkness entrench itself deeper into *both* of your minds while leaving you feeling more confident that you are *free* of it—and the only reason it works is that



It is an astonishingly simple and effective trap, but the only reason we fall for it is that the very same darkness lives in our own minds. There is a part of you that *knows* that mocking and shaming your enemies will only help them cozy up to their darkness, which will help you blame them even more—but it convinces you that you can get away with this, because you have *plausible deniability.* After all, you are only *fighting evil*—and how could that ever be wrong?

Of course, your behavior might *actually* produce some good. It might, for example, suppress their misbehavior—at least, in public, and for a time—thus convincing your rational mind that it *was* good. This, coupled with the fact that nobody can *prove* your malicious intent, prevents you from ever detecting that the whole thing was secretly orchestrated by your darkness in order to make the world a slightly worse place—thus paving the way for even *more* darkness.

We're all aware of the atrocities enabled by institutional self-deception: governments waging unjust wars to line the pockets of the rich; corporations desecrating nature for profit; factory farms inflicting unimaginable cruelty upon animals, etc. All of this abuse is only possible under a vast shroud of darkness—and that shroud is made of only one thing: our collective willingness to turn away from our own inner light.



This is the only reason we ever see other people as *inherently evil*, or indeed feel intrinsically superior to them in any other way. 


---
---


People don't know when they're doing wrong—or rather, part of them knows perfectly well, but this knowledge is carefully shielded from conscious self-reflection so that they can convincingly pretend *not* to know—even to themselves. All they consciously hear are their own clever justifications.

We subconsciously recognize when others are engaged in such self-deception, and it makes us perceive them as *bad people*—that is, fundamentally morally defective and thus completely unlike us. We treat them with *contempt,* believing that we're fighting their evil—but for some reason this only makes them dig in their heels.

We tell ourselves that this is because they are, indeed, fundamentally defective—but the real reason is that contempt is *itself* profound self-deception. The deepest part of you knows that you're not *intrinsically* superior to anyone—the "bad people" included. It also knows that by pretending to be, you are revealing the darkness in your *own* mind, thus helping them feel more justified.

The key word is *helping*. Part of you knew *perfectly well* that your behavior would only shove them deeper into the abyss, but you shielded this knowledge from conscious self-reflection, so that you could convincingly pretend not to know—*even to yourself*. Sound familiar?

What we think of as "evil" is more like a mental parasite, and nearly all of us are infected. It hides itself perfectly from our own minds—so that we don't realize we're infected—while making us perceive it as *intrinsic* to others, so that we see them as inherently evil. We don't recognize that they're under the sway of a parasite that we ourselves share.

---

The darkness in both of your minds secretly orchestrated this ruse, specifically to reinforce itself in both of you while leaving you feeling more convinced that you are *free* of it. Going forward, you will be less likely to introspect on how your own behavior may be darkening the world, because you already have an irrefutable explanation for why things are so bad: it's because of these *bad people.* It is an *impossibly* clever trap—and we keep falling for it.



There is **no way** to improve the world by closing off your heart or withholding your Love.


---
---

Humans are masters of self-deception. We often engage in self-serving behaviors that we disguise as righteous. We give ourselves special privileges, employ "ends justify the means" reasoning, etc. It's obvious that if people did less of this, the world would be a much better place. But there's one small problem.

Consider the people who are the worst examples of this — the greedy bankers, hypocritical CEOs, corrupt politicians and all who support them. Do you feel *contempt* — the sense that they are *intrinsically morally defective,* and fundamentally unlike yourself? If you look carefully enough — and this is hard — you'll discover that this feeling is itself profound self-deception.

Part of us knows that we're not *fundamentally* superior to anyone, but we hide this fact from ourselves by feeling contempt. What we don't see — at least, consciously — is that this secretly telegraphs to them that we're under the sway of the very illusion that we're viciously judging *them* for. That makes them see *us* as slightly evil, allowing them to feel *more* justified in their misbehavior.

The hardest thing to communicate is that part of us sees this, too. We *know* that our contempt is secretly designed to shove others deeper into the abyss in a way that appears righteous. But if we were to consciously acknowledge this, then we would also recognize that we are indeed not fundamentally superior to our enemies — and thus that our cruelty toward them

The self-deception that the "bad people" employ (ends justify the means reasoning, giving themselves special privileges, etc.) is precisely the same phenomenon that we use to hate them for it.

What's self-deceptive about hating bad people? If you look carefully enough into your mind while feeling this way, you'll discover that something in you knows that you're not fundamentally superior to them — or to anyone. This is extremely difficult to admit, for exactly the same reason that they cannot recognize their own self-deception.

The more you confront this clearly and directly in yourself, the more you discover an astonishing fact: your willingness to engage in such self-deception actually *reinforces* that same tendency in them. In fact, the whole *reason* that you engage in hatred of "bad people" is to reinforce their badness, so that you always have something to hate.

A simple example is how we mock and shame our enemies. Part of us knows that they will just dig in their heels, but we secretly want them to, because it proves just how bad they are. This gives us plausible deniability to escalate — our true goal, whether we realize it or not.

What's the purpose of all this? To better hide our own self-deception from ourselves. Any time we feel contempt for another being, what's really happening is that we're hiding the self-serving aspects of our own agendas and behaviors from ourselves. But it never *feels* like that, does it? No, it feels impossibly righteous. This is the trick by which the darkness hides from our minds.

It is impossible to overstate just how much of our present crises have their origin in such self-deception. We're focused on the mechanics of *how* to make the world better, but without seeing how every such mechanism is trivially and effortlessly co-opted by our dark sides without our conscious awareness, all of that effort will be for naught — or far worse.

This is why we cannot *think* our way out of the mess. Even "bad people" *think* they are doing good. A deeper part of them *knows* that they are engaged in self-deception, but that part is not reachable by thought. There is "something else" within you that knows when you're not aligned with what most deeply matters. And amazingly, the more closely you do align, the more your efforts to "fight evil" actually succeed. You're no longer shoving people deeper into the abyss in the name of good, but somehow pulling them *out*.

The only reason that "bad people" need to employ self-deception in the first place is that part of them wouldn't tolerate their misbehavior if only it knew. The way to stop their evil (in a lasting way) is to expose them to that part of themselves — and the only way to do *that* without causing a mess is for you to rediscover that part of yourself.

Consider the "bad people" of the world — the murderers, the rapists, the child abusers; the greedy bankers, hypocritical CEOs, corrupt politicians, etc. Don't they seem *intrinsically* defective — as though the evil is somehow *inherent* to their very minds?

It turns out that the aspect of mind that makes you see yourself as *fundamentally* different from them is precisely the *same* aspect that enables them to do wrong in the first place — and simply by giving credence to it, you *strengthen* that same capacity in them.

This can be extremely difficult to admit — and it is precisely that difficulty that enables evil to spread itself in our world unchecked. Something in us *needs* to see ourselves as different and special, even if only from the "bad people." What we don't realize is that the only purpose of this belief is to shield us from seeing all the ways in which we ourselves cause harm.

It's not that "bad people" don't know that they're doing wrong, per se. Part of them knows *perfectly well* — but this knowledge is carefully shielded from conscious self-reflection, so that they can honestly claim not to. All they consciously hear are their own clever justifications. It is a paradoxical state of mind, in which they simultaneously know and yet somehow don't. It is the same trick that our own minds use to hide our own wrongdoing from ourselves.

Reflect on how it feels to mock and shame your enemies

Hitler famously believed that he was doing good — but is it possible that some part of him secretly knew better? It's obviously difficult to know for sure, but notice if there's a part of you that wants to believe that no part of him knew — that he was *intrinsically* morally defective, and therefore *fundamentally* unlike yourself.

Here's the hardest thing to admit: the aspect of our minds that enables us to see ourselves as fundamentally different from others is the same aspect that allowed Hitler to do what *he* did — and any time we give credence to this mistaken perception, we induce the same tendency in others. We thereby make it *more* likely that similar atrocities will be committed in the future.

Wise people urge compassion for evildoers, but what does this really mean?

When you perceive yourself as *fundamentally superior* to the "bad people," what you are really doing is provoking that same tendency in them, so that they will become *worse* people, whom you can then hate more.

Do you know that you're doing this? Yes and no. Part of you knows it *perfectly well,* but this knowledge is carefully shielded from conscious self-reflection, so that you can honestly claim *not* to know. All you hear are your own clever justifications. It is precisely the same trick that enables the "bad people" to do what *they* do.

There is something in your mind that *needs* you to divide the world into fundamentally good and bad people; those who deserve your compassion and those who deserve your contempt. Simply by making this distinction, you will provoke the "bad people" into seeing *you* as bad, which will reinforce your certainty that you are right about them. What is this "something" in your mind? It is precisely the *same* "something" that enables them to do wrong in the first place.

The only way anyone can cause harm is by shielding themselves from fully perceiving the *life* in their victims — be they other people, animals, or Nature at large. Do they know that they're doing this? Yes and no. In one sense, they know it *perfectly well* — but that knowledge is cleverly hidden from their conscious minds, so that in another sense, they really don't.

By hating them for it, you are *reinforcing* this split. Do you *know* that you're doing this? Yes and no. Part of you knows it *perfectly well,* but you hide it from yourself — because if you saw it, you would suddenly realize that all the unkindness you've ever perpetrated on *anyone* — even those who "deserve" it — comes from *exactly* the same mistake that the "bad people" are trapped in.

When we think about the people responsible for what's wrong with the world — the "bad people" — we tend to feel _contempt_. Such people don't merely have worse ideas or behavior than us; they seem somehow _fundamentally morally defective_, and thus completely unlike us.

It feels like this contempt exists to help us fight evil, but something much darker is actually going on beneath the surface: if you introspect closely enough, you'll find that contempt exists only to make us behave in ways that will provoke people into _proving_ what bad people they are, so that we can feel justified in our contempt.

Something deep within us knows that there's no _intrinsic_ difference between us and them; that we ourselves are capable of almost anything under the right circumstances. Our subconscious uses contempt to help this fact stay hidden from consciousness. It does its job well, which is why you may not believe me when I say that you already know this.

Consider what happens when we mock our political opponents. Don't they just dig in their heels, see _us_ as evil, and vow to fight harder? We tell ourselves that we had "good intentions" (to shut them up; force them to introspect; convince others not to join them, etc.), but the truth is that something in us is _trying_ to maintain the polarization.

This ultimately harms the world, and part of us knows it. But "good people" don't act that way, and so we must hide this fact from consciousness. This is precisely what the "bad people" are doing: part of them knows perfectly well when what they're doing is wrong, but the _wrongness_ is carefully hidden from conscious self-reflection.
