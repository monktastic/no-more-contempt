There's a bizarre condition known as *anosognosia* (lit: not knowing that you don't know) in which stroke patients do not recognize one of their limbs as their own. No matter how carefully their doctor or loved ones try to help them see it, their brain *confabulates* (concocts) a story in which it actually belongs to someone else — often the doctor.

Neuroscientist VS Ramachandran discovered a surprising temporary cure: by pouring cold water in their ears, he reset their vestibular systems, restoring a level of awareness that allowed them to perceive the truth. Unfortunately, their state would revert just moments later.

How could such a patient know which reality was the "real" one — the one in which they recognized the limb as their own, or the one in which they saw it as someone else's? The situation may seem symmetrical — in both cases, they would *feel* completely sure — but I believe there's a crucial difference. In the water case, I think the patients saw not only that it was indeed theirs, but also *how* their minds had been fooling them into believing that it wasn't. Imagine how frustrating it must have been to see the truth, only to realize that it would be completely inaccessible just moments later, no matter how carefully they tried to hold onto it!

Something analogous is happening to nearly all of us, all the time. There is a part of you that recognizes your profound interdependence with all of reality — more intimate than that between your torso and limbs, in fact — and yet part of you shields this knowledge from yourself. 



It is this *same* mechanism that allows the "bad people" of the world to do what *they* do. It is the only way *anyone* can benefit themselves at the expense of others — be they other people, animals, or nature at large.
