All evil works in essentially the same way: part of the person's mind knows _perfectly well_ that what they are doing is wrong, but this knowledge is very carefully shielded from conscious self-reflection, so that it doesn't _feel_ wrong. All they hear are their own clever justifications. This makes us want to hate them, but the truth is that we are all intimately familiar with that very same state of self-deception ourselves. Every one of us has skirted our conscience before, pretending either that we couldn't hear it or that we didn't have to listen. Our examples may differ in degree, but not in kind.


---

Our minds only allow us to see a carefully curated subset of our misbehavior; the tip of the iceberg, so as to maintain our self-image as "good people."


---

Deep down, we know that we are not intrinsically superior to _anyone_ — and so pretending to be is _always_ self-deception.

The deepest aspect of our mind knows that we are not fundamentally better than anybody. This part is incapable of feeling malice, contempt, or self-righteousness, because it knows that these sentiments exist only to provoke more darkness.

The way this works is fascinating. The deepest part of us knows that we are not _fundamentally_ better than anyone, including the "bad people." By pretending that we are, we are telegraphing our own self-deception to them, which causes them to instinctively recognize the darkness in us, thus giving their self-deception an easy excuse to justify itself. It is like a secret handshake between our darkness and theirs. We may be enemies on the surface, but under the covers, our darkness is secretly allied.

Deep down, we know that we are not intrinsically better than anyone. But by simply perceiving ourselves as superior, and our enemies as _fundamentally morally defective_, we license ourselves to behave in ways that we otherwise could not. It helps us justify our self-serving agendas without realizing that we're doing so. And they can subconsciously sense that we are under the sway of self-deception — the very thing that we are viciously judging them for. This profound hypocrisy makes them perceive _us_ as fundamentally defective, so that they feel more justified in their misbehavior. That, in turn, convinces us that we were right about them, which compels us to escalate our righteous wrath.


---


The ultimate truth is that you _are_ everyone (and everything) else, in a profound and surprising sense. This is supposedly only realized fully upon _enlightenment,_ but all of us can sense it at all times. Your parasite lulls you into forgetting — and by doing so, makes you treat "others" in a way that encourages _them_ to forget, too. Hating "bad people" is an attempt to distance yourself further from them — and it works by encouraging them (and others) to become _worse people._


It is hard to admit, but there is darkness within each of us. It is not _intrinsic_ to our minds, but is more like a parasite. It knows that we are unwilling to harm people unless we see them as less than human — which most of us know is wrong. So it uses a clever trick: it alters our perception so that we see the darkness as intrinsic to some people's minds. We call them "bad people" and see them as subhuman, so that harming them becomes not just okay, but positively righteous.


---

Why do we enjoy mocking, shaming, and contemptuously judging our enemies? Deep down, we know that this behavior only _increases_ the "net darkness" in the world, but this knowledge is very cleverly shielded from our conscious minds so that we can easily convince ourselves it is a net good. It turns out that such self-deception is precisely what enables the "bad people" to do what _they_ do without compunction. By engaging in it ourselves, we reinforce the same tendency in them — and not by accident. Indeed, it is the secret _purpose_ of our contempt — and also the mechanism by which it works. You see, at the very deepest level, we know that we are not _intrinsically_ superior to anyone — so pretending that we are is already self-deception. But it also has the further effect of provoking our enemies into feeling contempt for _us_, which helps them feel justified in their misbehavior, which we can then use as an excuse to escalate ours while convincing ourselves that it is righteous. It is thus **profound, recursive** self-deception.

The only reason we ever feel contempt for anyone; that is, see them as fundamentally defective or ourselves as intrinsically superior, is that it is the most effective tool our darkness has to hide itself from us and thereby produce more. It has literally no other purpose. If you find this hard to believe, you are beginning to appreciate what makes it so difficult for the "bad people" to confront what _they_ are doing — for it is one of darkness's _milder_ illusions, and yet it is _still_ powerful enough to fool even otherwise-decent people. You have _no idea_ the depth and profundity of self-deception in which "truly evil" people are trapped.


It's not that mocking and shaming are intrinsically bad. They can probably be helpful in the right circumstances. But if there's even a trace of malice, contempt, or self-righteousness behind them, your subconscious is lying to you about its true motivation. It isn't actually _trying_ to help the world or other people in that moment. It's trying to prove you right; that your target really _is_ as horrible as you perceive them to be. And this strongly-held intention will encourage them to _become_ the villain that you need them to be to uphold your worldview and self-image.


---

What has actually happened is that the darkness in our mind conspired with theirs to produce _more_ darkness. It is a kind of "secret handshake"; one that you can learn to perceive. We may believe that we and they are enemies, but our darkness is secretly allied. In fact, they aren't truly separate. The darkness in all of our minds together behaves like a singular _distributed malevolent entity_, manipulating all of humanity from beneath our conscious thresholds. The Christians know it as the Devil, and the Buddhists call it the ego. You can treat it as a metaphor, but it is also as real as anything you can touch. It is why we sometimes suspect the existence of an evil global conspiracy. It is the _primordial_ evil conspiracy; the one to which all the rest owe their existence, and to which they ultimately filter up. 

Every act of unkindness we have ever perpetrated on _anyone_ has only ever been in service of the Beast — and part of us has always known this.

We believe that our darkness exists to help us fight the darkness in others or to protect ourselves from it, but nothing could be further from the truth. 

It hides itself precisely by convincing us that it doesn't exist — or that it doesn't exist within _us_.  The only way to turn against it is to relinquish all traces of unkindness in our hearts.

---

The more you see this, the more you discover an astonishing truth: the darkness in all of our minds is collaborating.


---


A mind that is free of self-deception simply cannot feel malice, contempt, or self-righteousness toward anybody, because it sees clearly that these sentiments exist _only_ to pull us under the sway of our own darkness; and that from this place, we are _only_ capable of spreading that darkness while not realizing that we are doing any such thing.

---

Kindness doesn't mean being nice or gentle, or even tolerant or understanding. It can be as fierce or even violent as the situation warrants.

But this violence is directed at the darkness itself. Even if the person must be subdued or harmed, there is not even a _trace_ of malice, contempt, or self-righteousness for them. Instead, there is a kind of Love. Not something soft and squishy, nor even directed at them, per se – but not specifically excluding them, either. This is a profound Love for all of reality; one that does not tolerate deception either in oneself or others. The deep integrity of this motivation reverberates throughout reality, subduing the darkness wherever it is found. It is completely lacking the egoic satisfaction we normally we feel when seeing our enemies destroyed, but in its stead is a much deeper satisfaction: the knowledge that the Light has infiltrated

Contempt is the dark urge to shove people deeper in, and compassion is its opposite. **Compassion does not mean being nice**. It means dismantling the self-deceptive tendencies in ourselves and others, whatever that requires. It can be fierce or even violent. It can use mockery and shaming. But it cannot contain even a _trace_ of malice, contempt, or self-righteousness, because these are _always_ signs of the Darkness operating.

Kindness does not mean being nice or gentle: that is just a lie that the Darkness tells. It is only about being deeply aware of our own astonishing capacity for self-deception. This makes us increasingly perceptive to the myriad ways in which our behavior has "unintended" consequences that are actually secretly intended by the shadow aspect of our minds.

It can be as fierce or even violent as the situation warrants. There is no specific form that it must take. Its only defining quality is that it is utterly free of self-deception. There cannot be even the _slightest_ trace of malice, contempt, or self-righteousness, or else it is only the darkness masquerading as the Light. These two can be extremely hard to tell apart — but only because we have convinced ourselves that we do not need to; that our intentions couldn't possibly matter. Nothing could be further from the truth: our innermost motivations _always_ leak into the world, manipulating it in ways that are largely hidden from our conscious minds. But it is only our _darkness_ that hides this; our Light can always perceive these subtle networks of causality.

It can express contempt for beliefs and behaviors. It can even use mockery, shaming, and _apparent_ contempt for people in its service. Its only defining characteristic is that it is utterly free of self-deception. If there is even the _slightest_ trace of malice, _genuine_ contempt, or self-righteousness, then it is already infected with the seed of darkness.  Genuine kindness has the opposite effect. Even if it appears wrathful from the outside, its unmistakable integrity prevents the darkness in others from finding the "hook" it would otherwise use to justify itself. It is thereby subdued, and their "inner Light" is increasingly revealed, if imperceptibly at first.


---

Our inner Light can perceive these subtle networks of causality, seeing how they will play out, but we choose not to look — and it is this choice, to look away from our Light, that is infectious.

---

Make no mistake: there are indeed people who have "welcomed in" the Darkness in a way that we have not, and who must be fought relentlessly. Similarly, the elites may well be playing us off each other, to take attention away from themselves. But the Darkness is playing a _much bigger game;_ one in which even the elites are merely pawns. It is playing all of humanity against itself — and it is winning. To fight other humans with _contempt_ is to fight on its side.

Make no mistake: there are indeed people who have knowingly welcomed the Darkness in, and their evil must be fought relentlessly. But they are the "final bosses" of the Darkness: the places where you are most likely to abandon your compassion, and fall back into the warm embrace of the Darkness. They are the people who need the _most_ compassion, in the sense of surgical precision to excise the Darkness; the people who we should _least_ be shoving deeper in.

Make no mistake: there certainly _are_ people who knowingly harbor the darkness, and who conspire to bring great harm — and they must be stopped. 

Make no mistake: there certainly _are_ people who knowingly embrace the darkness, and who can surely be called "evil." They really do conspire in ways that harm us all, and they must be stopped. But it is impossible to defeat them while we still view evil as something foreign to ourselves. Rather, the more clearly you perceive how the darkness has seduced your own mind, the more you see how it has commandeered theirs, and the more insight you gain into how to evict it without making things worse.

Make no mistake: there really _are_ people who knowingly embrace the darkness, and who can surely be called "evil." They really do conspire in ways that harm us all, and they must be stopped. But it is not possible to defeat them while we still view their evil as something foreign to ourselves. Rather, it is only by owning up fully to our own darkness that we begin to appreciate the ways in which other minds are stuck. The more you see this, the more you feel compassion. Not in the sense of being nice or gentle. True compassion can be fierce, or even violent. But it is rooted in a pure motivation; a deep recognition of the interconnectedness of all things. From this place, it is impossible to feel malice, contempt, or self-righteousness toward anyone — and this makes all the difference. The more your mind is free of self-deception, the less of a "hook" it offers for other people's darkness to latch onto. This is the only way to defeat it. But beware: the more entrenched their darkness, the more easily you will find justification for your own self-deception without ever realizing it.

Make no mistake: evil conspiracies really do exist, but every one of us is doing something to keep them alive while convincing that we are valiantly fighting them. That is the secret purpose of our contempt. The more we uncover the darkness in our own minds, the more clearly we see this.

---

We tell ourselves that our intentions couldn't possibly matter; that they are confined to our skulls, and that only our actions have consequences — and this is precisely _how_ our darkness gets us to look away for long enough to infuse itself into those very actions, thereby escaping our skulls.

---

Until we see how cleverly it has seduced us, it is impossible to understand how deviously it has tricked others into adopting it — and therefore, to do anything genuinely useful about it. We can only create more. It _is_ possible for our darkness to suppress other people's misbehavior — at least, their public misbehavior, and for a time. It is thus easy to convince ourselves that it "worked" — but only because we're not looking closely enough. Even if we manage to violently eradicate our enemies, the profound darkness required to do so would powerfully awaken the shadows of every mind it touches; friend or foe, near or far.

Such behavior _can_ temporarily suppress the darkness in others, of course — but with enough sensitivity, you can always detect its long-term harm.


It is of course possible for our hatred to suppress other people's misbehavior — their _public_ misbehavior, anyway, and for a time. We therefore easily convince ourselves that it "worked," but only because we're choosing not to look too carefully. And it is precisely this decision, to not look too carefully, that is the very essence of darkness. It is ultimately all darkness _is_.


---

Consciously, we don't realize that we're being manipulated; it feels like we're expressing a natural and healthy instinct to violently attack evil — which we now mistakenly equate with attacking the _people_. But no matter how subdued our attack (e.g., mockery), our underlying malicious intent makes us appear evil to them for exactly the same reason that they appear evil to us.

The truth is that darkness exists within every one of us, but it hides from our minds in fiendishly clever ways. It keeps our attention fixated perpetually outward, on the darkness "out there," where we feel compelled to viciously attack it in hopes of subduing it. There's just one "small problem" with this plan: it doesn't work. It's not even _supposed_ to work.

Darkness exists within us all, but it carefully hides itself from our conscious awareness by keeping our attention fixated perpetually outward, on the darkness "out there," where we feel compelled to viciously attack it in hopes of subduing it. There's just one "small problem" with this plan: it doesn't work. It's not even _supposed_ to work. Our vicious behavior is actually our darkness telegraphing itself to our enemies, thereby making them see us as evil. This helps them feel _more_ justified in their misbehavior, because they are perceiving genuine darkness. We then take as proof that _they_ are evil, thus licensing us to escalate. This is not a "problem" with the plan; it _is_ the plan.

Like all self-deception, it has a secret purpose. Our contempt subconsciously telegraphs to our target that we are harboring the same darkness within ourselves that we are viciously judging them for, which makes them perceive us as evil for precisely the same reason we see them that way. They are perceiving genuine darkness in us, and it helps them justify their misbehavior, because their enemies clearly aren't so innocent. But from our perspective, we were only doing our best to fight evil — and if they couldn't see this, well, it only proves that they are _fundamentally_ morally defective after all, thus licensing us to escalate.

We always have a choice in how we respond to evil, but if there is even a trace of self-deception left within us, our response will always become tainted with our own darkness, thereby seeping into the world without our conscious knowledge. It's not just that our darkness is hiding itself from us; it's that such hiding _is what darkness is_.

Our darkness uses the darkness "out there" to provide cover for itself, without our ever realizing that this is what we're really up to. It is precisely the same mechanism that prevents the "bad people" from seeing what _they_ are doing. It seems obvious to us that they should be able to see it when pointed out, not realizing that we have precisely the same blind spot — and that we are continually using this blind spot to reinforce theirs, to provide more cover for our own.

---

It doesn't matter who it's aimed at or what they've done; this sentiment exists _only_ for our darkness to draw us into that shadowy realm without our conscious knowledge.


- look toward our agendas.

- The longer we look away from our Light, the harder it gets to tell them apart, until finally...

- Inability to sense the humanity in other people; the life in other beings and nature as a whole.
 
- keeps our attention perpetually fixated outward, on ...

- As long as there is even a trace of self-deception, ... atrocities.

Why is evil so hard to vanquish? Is it because of a secret cabal that we must discover and defeat? Why do wise people urge compassion for evildoers? Surely sometimes it is the wrong response.



This whole dance was carefully orchestrated by our darkness and shielded from our conscious minds. In fact, it's not just that the darkness is hiding itself from our minds; it's that this act of hiding is itself _what darkness is_. You see, at the very deepest level, we know that we are not intrinsically superior to anyone. Therefore, contempt — that is, the mere perception of others as _fundamentally defective_ — is a form of self-deception, regardless of whom it is aimed at. This self-deception is precisely how the "bad people" do what _they_ do without compunction. Part of them knows perfectly well that they're doing wrong, but this knowledge is very cleverly shielded from conscious self-reflection, so that it doesn't feel wrong. Contempt is simply our darkness attempting to resonate with theirs, to reinforce itself in both minds without either person realizing it. It is a kind of secret handshake between our darkness and theirs.


---
---


cleverly shields itself from our minds, so that we feel morally licensed to attack it in others by engaging in subtly dark behaviors ourselves — behaviors that we do not recognize as dark for precisely the same reason that our enemies cannot detect it in themselves. It is precisely this willingness to use the darkness to our advantage, while denying that we are doing any such thing, that telegraphs to them that we do not have pure intentions and thus cannot be trusted. Our darkness is intentionally revealing itself to them to provoke hostility, while hiding itself from us so that we remain confident that we are acting righteously. We then blame the newfound darkness on them, thus licensing ourselves to escalate.

This is the only reason we ever feel contempt for anyone; that is, perceive them as _fundamentally defective_ or ourselves as intrinsically superior. It doesn't matter how "bad" they are or what they have done; this sentiment exists _only_ for our darkness to masquerade as our Light, licensing us to engage in self-serving behaviors that we don't recognize as such, and that we would never tolerate in our enemies. We tell ourselves that we don't necessarily _want_ to behave this way, but the "bad people" have forced our hand. We overlook the obvious ways in which our behavior will be a net harm to the world, and also the ways in which it secretly benefits us. When we _do_ gain said advantages, we treat them as "happy accidents" or "for the greater good" or simply inevitable. We are engaged in profound self-deception — the secret mechanism behind _all the evil there ever was._ And it is precisely the continual engagement of this mechanism that powers the engine of evil in the world.

Your inner Light knows how to free them from this deluded state, and thereby reduce the evil in the world, but your darkness has another plan. It convinces you can "have your cake and eat it, too" — that is, enjoy the dark pleasure of humiliating them while still producing a positive outcome. This is a lie. It is not possible to enjoy subjugating your enemies while still creating good.

---
---

Why is evil so hard to vanquish? Is it because of a secret cabal that we must discover and defeat? Why do wise people urge compassion for evildoers? Surely sometimes violence is more appropriate.

The truth is that there's a part of every one of us secretly fighting to keep evil alive — and this part is infinitely more clever than we can fathom.



If you look carefully enough into your mind while mocking, shaming, or contemptuously judging your enemies, you will see that this whole plan is already laid out in advance. In fact, it is there from the first instant you feel contempt for anyone; that is, choose to perceive them as _fundamentally defective_ or yourself as intrinsically superior. It doesn't matter who they are or what they have done. It is _always_ your darkness hiding itself from you so that it may radiate itself freely into the world. The above pattern is just one of countless ways in which it does so. One way or another, it _always_ leaks. You can see this clearly if you look. The problem is that we choose not to look — and it is precisely this "looking away" that is the secret mechanism behind all the evil there ever was.



Evil only requires looking away from our inner Light and toward our clever justifications. The longer we look away, the harder it becomes to tell them apart, or to even remember that there is an "inner Light," and that choosing it matters profoundly. We increasingly confuse it with the clever voice in our head that masquerades _as_ the Light but just happens to align with our interests and agendas, until finally, the identity theft is complete. This confusion, or decision to look away, is infectious. We convince ourselves that our intentions couldn't possibly matter; that they remain confined to our skulls, and that only our actions have consequences. But this is precisely _how_ our darkness gets us to look away, so that it may infuse itself into our actions and thereby escape our skulls. These actions then go on to infect countless others, who for some unknown reason feel the urge to turn away from the Light themselves. They subconsciously sense that the world has become darker, and _their_ darkness uses this as the perfect excuse to ingratiate itself further.

There is a secret network of darkness operating just beneath our conscious thresholds. We easily sense it in the self-serving lies of our politicians, and the corporate doublespeak that hides the destruction of our very planet behind pretty platitudes. But what we have not yet recognized is that none of this could exist without the silent complicity of nearly every one of us. The darkest lie of all is that if we only rounded up all the "bad people" and extinguished them, the rest of us would live in harmony. Harboring this thought is itself the surest sign that if such a day were to come, we would be the first in line to carry the torch forward under a newly disguised banner. It is precisely our inability or unwillingness to confront our own self-deception that enables the darkness to accumulate itself into the large-scale evils, which we then use to further protect our own. You can sense it in the continual background hum of casual cruelty that has come to nearly define our civilization. None of this means that it's our fault, per se — but it does mean that each of us has a crucial role to play in ending the madness.





It is impossible to put too fine a point on the difference between these two approaches, no matter how similar they can outwardly appear. In one of them, we are gleefully shoving the person deeper into the abyss, by convincing ourselves that they "deserve" it. Part of us can _always_ sense their inner Light, no matter how well hidden, and even when they cannot consciously detect it in themselves. We are smothering its cries, knowing fully well that no one will blame us for it, and that we will have plausible deniability even if they do. It is _malevolent,_ and it is this malevolence that leaks into the world, sullying it, even when we are convinced that it couldn't possibly. In the other approach, we are refusing to forsake them, even when they have forsaken themselves. It is the one thing their darkness cannot stand: incontrovertible proof that the Light isn't just a myth. All of its tricks are rendered useless against this primordial foe, and it is forced to release its grip. We must forego the violent pleasure of seeing our apparent enemies subjugated, but in exchange are rewarded with the incomparable satisfaction of watching our true enemy permanently evaporate.

The very root of self-deception is the belief that we are intrinsically superior to _anyone_. It is the only way we can license ourselves to behave in self-serving ways; to benefit ourselves at the world's expense. In truth, what we are in our innermost core is the Light — and so is everybody else. In fact, what we ultimately discover is that we _are_ everyone and everything else, just pretending that we're not.

---

We convince ourselves that we should be allowed to get away with lots of little things that we would never tolerate in our enemies.

The dark hostility we feel for others is thus a good measure of how much self-deception we have left within us.

Nature.

---
---



---


Even if the person must be harmed or subdued in the process, they can subconsciously sense that it is somehow not _they_ that are being targeted. Their darkness is thus not offered the "hook" in our minds that it previously used to justify itself.

Thus, fighting evil has less to do with advancing the right agendas than with freeing our own minds of this mind-virus that sabotages our every effort to accomplish lasting good. The cleaner our own minds become, the less threatening our genuinely compassionate agendas then appear to others. This may be a frustratingly slow process, but it is the only thing that doesn't move us backwards. 

This "inner Light" is what you _are_ in your innermost core. 

---
---

Why do wise people urge compassion for evildoers? Are they being naive? Or have we misunderstood what compassion is?

As long as we harbor _any capacity at all_ for self-deception, we are capable of great evil under the right circumstances — or rather, the wrong ones. This may strike us as ridiculous, but the deepest part of us knows it to be true. To hide it from us, our minds do something _insanely_ clever. They make us hunt for the darkness in others, as though destroying theirs could be a substitute for taming our own. But it turns out we're not actually destroying theirs either. You see, our enemies can subconsciously sense the malice in our motivation, and it makes them see _us_ as evil for precisely the same reason that we see them that way. It makes them feel more justified in their story. To us, this is obviously just more delusion, because we know that we are the good guys. If they cannot see that our intentions were pure, it only proves that they are indeed fundamentally morally defective, thus licensing escalation. Eventually, we will be forced to commit genuine atrocities to halt their evil.

What began with noble intentions descended into hell, for a very specific reason. Somewhere along the line, we stopped looking too carefully at our innermost motivations and started listening to our darkness. It is the only reason we _ever_ feel contempt for anyone — that is, see them as fundamentally defective or ourselves as intrinsically superior. Once this has happened, our mind _will_ produce more darkness in the world, one way or another, without our noticing that we are doing so. It is completely inevitable. In this case, what happened is that our darkness secretly telegraphed itself to our enemies while hiding itself from us. Part of our mind _wanted_ them to recognize authentic darkness in our minds while giving ourselves plausible deniability that we harbored any such thing. This is _profound_ self-deception, and that is _why_ it works. Part of us knew that we were doing this, but we convinced ourselves that nobody else could detect it. Yet a deeper part knows that our darkness _always_ leaks.





---

Consider our political enemies. The darkness that lives in them lives within us too, but we cannot admit it, so our minds do something impossibly clever. We mock, shame, and contemptuously judge them, knowing fully well that this will only make them see _us_ as evil, and thus feel _more_ justified in their misbehavior. But because we have convinced ourselves that we are acting from pure intentions, we take their recalcitrance as proof that _they_ are evil, thus licensing us to escalate. The problem is, deep down we know we are engaged in self-deception — and moreover, we know that no matter how carefully we try to hide it, our enemies can sense it too — and so they are _right_ when they perceive our intentions as dark. 

---

Our own darkness is kept hidden from our conscious minds, but deep down, we can sense its awful presence. Rather than confront it, we go hunting for the darkness in others, hoping that destroying theirs will somehow make up for our avoidance of our own. But there's one little problem: if you look carefully enough into your desire to attack the darkness in others, you will discover that it is _malevolent_. We do not wish to free others of their evil, but to shove them deeper _into_ the abyss. They thereby become _more_ evil, which we consciously lament, but subconsciously celebrate — because their darkness helps us hide from our own. It turns out this is the only reason we ever see others as _fundamentally defective_ or intrinsically inferior. It is a trick that our darkness uses to hide itself from us.

This happens at a subconscious level, so you can legitimately claim not to know that we are doing it. In fact, this is what makes it work — for your enemy can subconsciously sense that you are acting from the very principle that you are viciously judging _them_ for. This makes them see _you_ as evil for the same reason you see them that way, which helps their self-deception justify itself to them — because their enemies clearly aren't so innocent after all. But because you believe your intentions to be pure, you take their recalcitrance as proof that they are indeed fundamentally defective, thus licensing you to escalate. This is **profound** self-deception — which, again, is why it works. It is the combination of your darkness hiding itself from you while loudly telegraphing itself to them that is the winning combo.

It is the perfect trap. We each believe that we must harden our hearts to the world to defeat the darkness out there, not realizing that this instinct is itself that very darkness manifesting itself through our minds in a brilliant bid to keep itself alive. It relies on our inability to recognize this to work. In truth, it's not really an inability, but an unwillingness. It's just that if we recognized it _as_ an unwillingness, we would suddenly realize what makes it so hard for the "bad people" to confront _their_ self-deception — and why our contempt is secretly designed to _keep_ them from confronting it, which is precisely the opposite of what we tell ourselves. So we keep this knowledge hidden under lock and key. We see that _our_ darkness is rooted in pain and therefore isn't really darkness at all, but we must never extend this grace to others. Thus, it is said "be kind, for everyone you meet is fighting a great battle." But instead, we have trapped each other in a kind of "Mexican standoff."

It is impossible to convey the full depths of this tragedy — because to our conscious minds, some people appear so depraved that no "great battle" could possibly account for their behavior. Such people do not need "self-deception" to do evil because they simply _are_ evil. But this belief is the ultimate trap. You see, the darkness in all of our minds is intimately connected, behaving like a singular distributed malevolent entity, manipulating all of humanity from beneath our conscious thresholds. The Christians know it as the Devil, and the Buddhists call it the ego. You can treat it as a metaphor, but it is also as real as anything you can touch. It is this "entity" that you are confronting when you perceive evil in the eyes of another. Yes, they may have welcomed it in, and at some level are knowingly harboring it, but to feel contempt for _them_ — as opposed to for _it_ — is an unmistakable sign that it has already infected your mind, and from there, _will_ leak out into the world.



There is no personal gratification to be found here.

---


If we were to suddenly become aware of the full depths of our own self-deception, we would suddenly find ourselves unable to judge anyone for anything. We simply could not feel malice, contempt, or self-righteousness. Our hearts would explode in profound agony over the horrifying trap that humanity has locked itself in. To be clear, it is _contemptuous_ judgement that would evaporate; the mistaken sense that "I am fundamentally _better_ than you." Judgement in the sense of wise discernment would certainly continue; in fact, it would be greatly strengthened, because it would finally be divested of self-sabotage. We might still express contempt for behaviors and beliefs — and sometimes even _apparent_ contempt for people — but the complete absence of darkness in our hearts would carry the unmistakable "zing" of the Light, preventing the darkness in others from finding the "hook" in our minds that it previously used to justify itself to them.

It is as though there exists a parallel reality hidden just beneath our own — one that you can learn to perceive. Actions that appear righteous on the surface are often pumping darkness into the world, while behaviors that seem unkind in the conventional sense may be secretly spreading the Light. 


If we could see what kindness truly means, we would understand that it cannot be deserved. It is the firm decision to 

Nobody could "deserve" unkindness, both because it darkens their mind and because the damage does not stay confined to them. It is a vehicle for the darkness to gain entry into our world. 

It is the _primordial_ evil conspiracy; the one to which all the rest owe their existence, and to which they all filter up.  Any time you are unkind to anyone for any reason or perceive yourself as intrinsically superior, you are feeding the Beast; increasing the chances that other people will abandon the Light.

The _only_ reason we maintain a distinction between "people who deserve my compassion" and "those who deserve my contempt" is for the darkness to keep its foot in the door of our minds. This is a subtle point, and easily misunderstood. Clearly we cannot be _nice_ to evil people, but compassion has nothing to do with being nice or gentle or even tolerant or understanding. It can be as fierce (or even violent) as the situation warrants. But it is rooted in a completely different principle; one that is entirely free of malice.

The problem is that part of you knew perfectly well that you were doing this — and thus that blaming them for their reaction is just more self-deception, generating more darkness in the world. So we must hide this too, resulting in an ever-tightening noose of self-deception from which it is nearly impossible to escape. But it's not truly unconscious in the sense of being _inaccessible_ to consciousness; it's just extremely well hidden. 

This provides an airtight vehicle for the darkness to spread itself without anyone having to take responsibility. The problem is that we _knew_ our intentions weren't actually pure — yet we thought that by lying hard enough to ourselves about this fact, that they would magically _become_ pure, thus compelling our enemy to bow before our righteousness. But the truth is that the harder we lie to ourselves, the more loudly our darkness telegraphs itself to the world beneath our conscious threshold, powerfully inviting others to respond in kind. And the greatest lie we tell ourselves is that we are intrinsically superior to others; that they are _fundamentally defective_, and thus worth of our contempt. Contempt for beliefs or behaviors is one thing, but contempt for people has only one purpose: 

Subconsciously colors your perception, but you can learn to see it.

If we had just looked carefully enough into our own mind before behaving in this way, we could have saved this world from needless grief. 


We believe that our tiny lies to ourselves are hidden from the world, but the truth is that our subconscious is loudly telegraphing them to others beneath everyone's conscious threshold. 

This isn't a philosophy but a direct perception.

Subtle perception of causality.

It knows how to behave in a way that will not reinforce their delusion. But your darkness does not want you to see this. So to hide this knowledge from you, the darkness in your mind alters your perception, causing you to see them as _fundamentally morally defective_ and thus worthy of only contempt. You will then license yourself to engage in self-serving behaviors that you will not be able to recognize as such, convincing yourself that they are _righteous_. But there is no reason we _ever_ perceive anybody as _fundamentally defective_ except to justify our own darkness. If we do not realize this, it is only because we are caught in the same delusion that we are viciously judging _them_ for. In this state, we can only compound the darkness.

The mechanism by which we do so is fascinating. The darkness in _their_ mind instinctively recognizes itself in ours, and is therefore able to justify itself to them even more powerfully. They perceive us as evil for the very same reason we see them that way, and thus feel more licensed in their misbehavior. This isn't an unfortunate side effect of our otherwise-noble intentions; no, the darkness in our mind is intentionally telegraphing itself to them to produce this outcome. It is a kind of secret handshake between our darkness and theirs. Yet it prevents us from acknowledging this, so that we take their recalcitrance as evidence that they are indeed fundamentally defective, thus licensing us to escalate.

It's not that mocking, shaming, or even violence are _intrinsically_ wrong. But they can either be motivated by our profound Love for the world, or from our self-deception. These two feel **profoundly** different, and have tremendously different effects on the world. Yet it can be hard to tell them apart — not because they are similar, but because we are so accustomed to deceiving ourselves. We easily convince ourselves that our intentions couldn't possibly matter, and that other people cannot sense them. Yet it is only our darkness that makes us believe this, because that is how it controls us. Our inner Light has access to a much subtler dimension of causality. It sees how our deepest intentions _always_ leak out into the world, in ways that are hidden from our conscious minds. Any time we are unkind to anyone for any reason, we are being self-deceptive. And all acts of self-deception lower the threshold for darkness to manifest elsewhere in the world, where we can disavow our own connection to it.

Our entire society is built on a mutual agreement to hide from our consciences. We consider it normal and healthy for people on our team to be cruel to people on the other team, despite knowing deep down that we are only escalating the animosity. Our agreement isn't merely with our teammates; 


You have _no idea_ how insidious this is. We are all using each other's darkness as an excuse to keep our own alive, convincing ourselves that ours isn't wrong; that we _need_ it, to fight the evil out there. But your darkness isn't actually fighting mine; they are secretly allied. In fact, they aren't truly separate at all. 

---

But here's the thing. People who are genuinely free of self-deception themselves simply cannot feel malice, contempt, or self-righteousness toward anybody — and no matter how morally bankrupt your enemy, they subconsciously know this. Therefore, when they see you behaving this way, they instinctively know that you are acting from the very same self-deception that you are viciously judging _them_ for — and it makes them see _you_ as evil for the very same reason you see _them_ that way. This makes them feel more justified in their behavior, which you can then use as an excuse to escalate your own.

In other words, simply by introducing an element of _contempt_ to behaviors that might otherwise actually serve to fight evil, you are tainting your noble intentions in a way that gives you plausible deniability. After all, how could your _intentions_ possibly have any effect on the real world? Only your behaviors do.

As long as there are any places where you still lie to yourself — and there are surely many — something in you is continuously amplifying the darkness in the world to keep itself hidden from you.

---

What we can't see is that _hating_ people for being evil is a form of the very same self-deception. Our hatred tends to shove people deeper _into_ the abyss rather than freeing them from it. The deeper they go, the more our hatred feels justified. This feedback loop isn't an unfortunate side effect of our otherwise-noble intentions, like we tell ourselves; indeed, it is the whole point. But this knowledge is very carefully shielded from our conscious minds. It feels like we are simply doing what any decent person would do when confronted with evil. After all, responding with kindness would be foolish, right? Wrong.

Kindness doesn't mean being nice or gentle. It can be as fierce or even violent as the situation warrants. The only requirement is that it be free of this self-deceptive trap in which we create more evil, usually under the guise of good. And it is not only hatred that does this. Any time you feel malice, contempt, or self-righteousness toward anybody for any reason, your mind is secretly darkening the world without your conscious knowledge. In fact, this act of hiding your true intentions from yourself is the very _essence_ of darkness, and it takes many forms. Every one of us has elevated or enriched ourselves at the world's expense, while covering it up with clever justifications. Every time we do this, we are lowering the threshold for others to do the same. We may believe that we are free from such delusion, but the best measure of how much we are still engaged in it is how much contempt we are able to feel for other people — regardless of whether it is "justified."

Why do we enjoy mocking and shaming our enemies; the "bad people"? Why do we perceive them as fundamentally defective, and ourselves as intrinsically superior? The answer may surprise you.

The darkness in their minds is resonating with ours. When we respond from this place, we easily convince ourselves that we are doing _good_, but part of our mind knows better. Our darkness is secretly using theirs as an excuse to license us to engage in some self-serving behavior. "Oh, look at how bad other people are; _we_ deserve to get away with more." You will not be able to detect exactly what you are getting away with, because it will not feel like _getting away_ with anything; it will feel entirely justified and reasonable. This is how the darkness works. It is precisely the same mechanism that has captured the mind of your enemies, making you perceive them as _fundamentally_ morally defective. They can subconsciously sense that _you_ are now engaged in the very thing that you are viciously judging them for, making them feel more justified in their misbehavior, which in turn makes you feel more justified in yours. Neither of you consciously recognizes this, but your minds are doing this on purpose. Darkness only ever creates more darkness, to provide more cover for itself.

It usually begins innocently enough, with our darkness pretending to be our Light. At first, they can be hard to tell apart. When we see someone hate a bad person, it is easy to believe that they are acting from their goodness. But as the darkness infects their mind, it becomes increasingly obvious that they are on the wrong path. Yet it's not obvious to them from the inside. In fact, the only way they could get that far was by their darkness producing increasingly compelling stories of how righteous they are. If our own stories are similar enough to theirs, we can easily slip into the same delusion with them. We feel like allies, together battling the darkness "out there," not realizing that our minds have been overtaken by the very phenomenon we're supposedly fighting. This is how political parties grow increasingly polarized, even as none of their members recognize their role in amplifying that polarity.

As we become aware of this process, that the people involved are fundamentally decent (if misguided), it seems clear that this polarization is being orchestrated from above. We then go seeking the truly evil people who are responsible, turning our hatred toward them, not realizing that we're falling for a deeper version of the very same trap. This trap, too, is being orchestrated — but by whom? Not by lizard people or alien overlords, but by the cumulative darkness in all our minds together. This dark mass behaves like a singular distributed malevolent entity, manipulating all of humanity from beneath our conscious thresholds. It is the _primordial_ evil conspiracy; the one to which all the rest owe their existence, and to which they all filter up. The Christians know it as the Devil, and the Buddhists call it the ego. You can treat it as a metaphor, but it is also as real as anything you can touch. Any time you are unkind to anyone for any reason or perceive yourself as intrinsically superior, you are feeding the Beast; increasing the chances that other people will abandon the Light.

MLK once said "darkness cannot drive out darkness," but is it really true? Surely sometimes we must fight fire with fire.

Here's the key insight: any time you hate or feel contempt for anybody, including the "bad people," your mind is not actually _trying_ to reduce the darkness in the world. It is trying to _increase_ it. Your darkness is using theirs as an excuse to justify itself, so that you feel licensed to engage in some self-serving behavior. "Oh, look at how _bad_ other people are; I deserve to get away with more." Of course, it will not _tell_ you that it is doing this; in fact, it will hide it very carefully from conscious self-reflection, so that all _you_ hear are its clever justifications. It is precisely the same mechanism that enables the "bad people" to do what they do — and they can subconsciously sense that _you_ are engaged in it. This makes them feel more justified in _their_ misbehavior, which in turn makes you feel more justified in yours. Again, your mind is doing this not only _knowingly_ but _on purpose_ any time you feel contempt for any person (although not necessarily for merely their beliefs or behaviors).

If you cannot countenance the fact that you are doing this, it is an unmistakable sign that your mind is under the sway of the very illusion that enables the "bad people" to do what they do without compunction. In this state, it is possible only to _spread_ the infection — though usually with the supreme conviction that you are valiantly combating it. This is why fighting the darkness _must_ begin with discovering the myriad ways in which it has seduced your own mind. Only then do you begin to perceive how it has ensnared others. Armed with this knowledge, you discover how to evict it from their minds without falling victim to its sinister lures yourself, and thereby spreading it.

It is impossible to overstate just how clever the darkness is. Our cumulative darkness behaves like a singular distributed malevolent entity, manipulating all of humanity from beneath our conscious thresholds. The Christians know it as the Devil, and the Buddhists call it the ego. You can treat it as a metaphor, but you can also learn to perceive it clearly and directly. It is why we sometimes suspect the existence of an evil global conspiracy. It is the _primordial_ evil conspiracy; the one to which all the rest owe their existence, and to which they all ultimately filter up. It remains in power not because of a handful of especially evil people, but because the vast majority of us have no idea that we are in on it.


The more you free yourself from this mind-virus, the less you are able to judge anybody for it. (Again, judgement here means _contemptuous_ judgement. Judgement in the sense of wise discernment can of course be helpful.)

---

Why is this not common knowledge? It is because our cumulative darkness is conspiring to keep it hidden. 

It is impossible to overstate the degree to which it has already taken over humanity. It is not even yet common knowledge that feeling contempt for your enemies is a sign that you are secretly in cahoots with the darkness that you are viciously judging them for. 


---
---


Try and recall what that state was like. It is a form of self-deception; one which we engage in far more often than we realize — and with much greater consequences. Perhaps the hardest example to admit to ourselves is _contempt_.

We don't hate "bad people" because of the good it does, but because our darkness is _resonating_ with theirs. It acts as a kind of secret handshake; our darkness telegraphing to theirs that we have fallen under the sway of ours. This makes them perceive _us_ as evil, further justifying their self-deception. We in turn take this as evidence that _they_ are evil, thus licensing us to escalate in the name of good.

The darkness has manipulated both of our minds, to strengthen itself beneath our conscious thresholds. In fact, all the darkness in the world is intimately connected, behaving like a singular malevolent distributed entity. It lives in something like a reality parallel to our own, but just as real. It is the reason that some people suspect the existence of an evil global conspiracy. It is the _primordial_ evil conspiracy; the one to which all the rest owe their existence, and to which they all ultimately filter up. You can treat this as a metaphor, but you can also learn to perceive it clearly and directly.

Every time you are ever unkind to anyone, or even simply perceive them as _fundamentally defective_ or yourself as _intrinsically superior_, your mind is secretly attempting to darken the world to further some self-serving agenda that you may not even be conscious of — and also provoking others to do the same. A person who is free of such self-deception simply cannot feel malice, contempt, or self-righteousness toward anyone for any reason. These sentiments are an unmistakable sign that your mind is secretly in cahoots with the people you viciously judge.



This is called kindness, which just means acting from your inner Light; steadfastly refusing to let the darkness gain a foothold. It need not be nice or gentle, even if those are its most common expressions. Kindness can be fierce or even violent if the situation warrants it, but even these behaviors are motivated by a profound Love — not for your target, per se, but not excluding them either. It is a Love for all of reality, that excludes nothing and forsakes no-one — and this motivation makes all the difference.

This is the hardest part to communicate. A person can appear to be doing tremendous good, while his mind is secretly pumping darkness into the world through countless invisible channels. And on the flip side, the quiet old lady down the street may be responsible for bringing vast amounts of Light into this world, yet not be recognized for her contributions, especially given how clouded our minds have become. We are looking in all the wrong places to determine what our true impact on this world is.

At the deepest level, you _are_ the Light. So is everybody else. In fact, in a profound and surprising sense, you _are_ everybody and everything, just pretending that you're not. Seeing this in its entirety is known as _enlightenment_, but all of us can sense it to some degree or another at all times. It is why we sometimes thank others for acts of generosity even when no obvious benefit accrues directly to us. Part of us can sense that what happens to anyone ultimately happens to everyone.



---

Contempt is _only ever_ an excuse to justify cruelty. We are hoping to provoke our target into behavior that will prove that they deserve our contempt and more. You see, the more contempt that other people deserve, the easier it becomes to use them as justifications for our own self-serving agendas without realizing that we are doing so. This is the _only_ reason you ever see anyone as fundamentally defective; intrinsically inferior.








---


Hating or judging other people for being evil is actually a secret desire to keep them trapped in darkness. This is a subtle point, and easily misunderstood. If judging means wise discernment, then it is your moral imperative to judge and call out misbehavior wherever you find it. But _contempt_ is a different matter entirely. It feels like "I am _fundamentally_ superior to you." Why does your attitude matter? Surely only your behavior has any real effect, right? Wrong.

This attitude secretly telegraphs to your target your inner knowledge that you are presently in no position to judge.

---

Here's the crucial insight: the only reason we ever feel contempt for anyone, or see them as _fundamentally defective_, is to use them as an excuse to manifest our own darkness. We don't hate "bad people" because of the good it will accomplish. We do it to provoke them into becoming _worse_ people, and to rile up our allies. That's because having more darkness to fight "out there" provides convenient cover to justify self-serving behaviors that would otherwise be out of character for us.


This is profound self-deception. Any time you perceive yourself as intrinsically superior to _any_ other person or contemptuously judge them, you _will_ license yourself to be unkind. Your subconscious is intentionally darkening in the world for some self-serving end that you probably cannot see. You are caught in precisely the same trap as your enemy, and you are secretly inviting them to stay there so that you may both continue to play the role of "bad guy" in each other's stories.

You see, the darkness in our minds never actually fights the darkness out there. It only pretends to, in order to create more of itself. It is only ever on its own team, and against all of humanity. In fact, your darkness and mine are not truly separate. All the darkness in the world is intimately connected, together behaving like a singular malevolent distributed entity, manipulating all of humanity from beneath our conscious thresholds.

The Christians know it as the Devil, and the Buddhists call it the ego. You can treat it as a metaphor, but it is also as real as anything you can touch. It is the reason that we sometimes suspect the existence of an evil global conspiracy. It is the _primordial_ evil conspiracy; the one to which all the rest owe their existence, and to which they all ultimately filter up. It stays in power not because of a handful of especially evil people, but because the vast majority of us have no idea that we are secretly feeding it.

Kindness has nothing to do with being nice or gentle. It can be as fierce or even violent as the situation warrants. There _are_ people who are knowingly harboring the darkness, and conspiring to bring great evil, and they must be fought relentlessly. But to the degree that you perceive yourself as being made of fundamentally better stuff than them — and, to be clear, this is more a feeling than a conscious belief — part of your mind is secretly in cahoots with them. A more shocking plot twist exists nowhere in all of human literature.

The alternative is to recognize that they are indeed caught in the grip of a terrible delusion; one that you will not tolerate, for your sake _or_ theirs. This is very difficult to describe, but part of you knows exactly what I mean. It is as though you are surgically targeting the parasite in their mind that enables their madness, while leaving the innocent parts unscathed. It can be exceedingly difficult to perceive any innocent part of such a person, or to even believe that such a part may exist. It can even be quite dangerous to _pretend_ that such a part exists if you cannot see it. But the more you root out all the crevices in your own mind where the darkness still lurks — and believe me, there are many — the more and more your vision opens up.

At the very deepest level, you are the Light. It is your fundamental nature. It is also everybody else's. In fact, in a profound and surprising sense, you _are_ everyone and everything else, just pretending not to be. The full realization of this is known as "enlightenment," but every one of us can taste it to some degree or another at all times. It is why we sometimes thank people for acts of charity that don't seem to benefit us directly. We can sense that whatever happens to anyone ultimately happens to everyone.

The more we see this, the harder it becomes to feel malice, contempt, or self-righteousness toward anyone, because we see clearly that these sentiments exist only to shove them deeper into the abyss — and that by forsaking them, we are only forsaking ourselves. Something in us isn't ready to come Home yet; to see the bigger picture. So we keep the game of animosity alive, to forestall our awakening. It is a powerful trick, and it works.


---


Why is part of you trying to darken the world? Because the darker it gets, the more justified _your_ self-deception becomes. Something in you is actively trying to create conditions that will provide cover for your self-serving behaviors, to quench desires that you may not even be conscious of having. It is the very _essence_ of evil. A person who is free of self-deception simply cannot feel malice, contempt, or self-righteousness toward anyone, because they have seen that all evil is a profound form of confusion. Hating people for this confusion is a secret mechanism for spreading more confusion in a way that appears noble.

Nearly all of humanity is presently caught in this trap. We are all convinced that _we_ are the righteous few, valiantly battling the hordes of evil, not realizing that it is our very perception of others as evil that keeps the evil alive. This is a subtle point, and easily misunderstood. There certainly are people out there who are willingly and knowingly harboring evil. But if you see this trait as intrinsic to their minds, you _will_ reinforce it in some way that is hidden from your mind. Even if you are not in direct contact with your target, you will spread contempt through your surroundings. Evil _always_ leaks.

The deepest part of you does not want to be secretly darkening the world, but feels it has no other option. Once you see this with complete clarity, you suddenly see that it applies to literally everybody else — including those that you were convinced were beyond help. This isn't just a belief; it is something you can directly perceive. It is as though there is a kind of parasite lodged in the minds of every human, and you can learn to see it clearly.

Even if you and I are enemies on the surface, our parasites are secretly allied, provoking each other into creating more darkness to feed off of. In fact, our parasites aren't truly separate. They are more like limbs of a singular distributed malevolent entity, manipulating all of humanity into doing its dark bidding. It is impossible to overstate how clever this organism is and how well it hides. It tricks each person into seeing it only in others, so that we strengthen it while flawlessly convinced that we are fighting it. It is the primordial evil global conspiracy; the one to which all the rest owe their existence, and to which they all ultimately filter up. The reason we cannot defeat it is because we _are_ it.

You _can_ learn to renounce your membership in this conspiracy and fight it, but it is the work of a lifetime. You must root out every tiny aspect of self-deception from your mind; every last place you are not taking responsibility for your impact on the world. The hardest place to see this is in our relationship with others; seeing how we hold them hostage to avoid confronting our own deficiencies. As we do this, we become kinder.

Kindness has nothing to do with being nice. Nice means pleasant and agreeable, which is surely the wrong response in many circumstances. Kindness means something much deeper. It can be fierce or even violent if the situation warrants it. But it always perceives the light hidden within others, no matter how buried. It holds them firmly accountable, but without a shred of self-righteousness or contempt. It is always in service of bringing more light to the world, instead fighting darkness with darkness, which only creates more. It doesn't adhere to any rules or serve any agendas, but is always tuned into the needs of the moment. It is the hardest thing to define, and yet every one of us knows it perfectly well.

That is because at the deepest level, we _are_ it. The true nature of your mind is compassion. You _are_ the Light.

When we perceive other people as evil, we usually see this quality as intrinsic to their minds. They're not just under the sway of a powerful self-deception that we ourselves are painfully susceptible to; no, they are fundamentally morally defective, much unlike us. What you cannot see in that moment is that your mind is playing a trick on you. It makes you perceive them that way so that you will feel licensed to treat them in ways that will reinforce their capacity for self-deception. In other words, make them more evil.

We enjoy mocking and shaming our enemies not despite the fact that it makes them dig in their heels, but because of it. Their doing so licenses us to escalate our righteous cruelty. The more evil and stupid we can show that they are, the easier it becomes to justify our own self-serving agendas. This is profound self-deception — and that's what makes it work. You see, you enemies can subconsciously perceive that you are being self-deceptive, and it makes them see you as evil for precisely the same reason that you see them that way. But because your mind hides this fact from you, you take their recalcitrance as evidence of _their_ evil.

Contempt for other people is secretly a desire to spread darkness in the world, and this mere hidden intention is itself sufficient to actually do so, by provoking others. Your enemies need not even be present. Simply by fomenting the same quality in your allies, you all but guarantee that the darkness finds its way into the world, reaching the far corners, where you can disown any connection to it. But part of you always knows.

It is extremely painful to become aware of this aspect of yourself, for obvious reasons. And it is impossible to convey the full depth of this realization. All the evil in the world is intimately connected. It together forms an enormous dark mass that is invisible to our conscious minds. It behaves like a singular distributed malevolent entity, continually manipulating all of humanity, tricking us each into seeing only the parts of it that are manifesting in others, so that we will viciously attack it and thereby secretly empower it. It is the primordial evil global conspiracy; the one to which all the rest owe their existence, and to which they all ultimately filter up. We discover that every time we were ever unkind to anyone for any reason; every time we acted from self-deception, we were secretly feeding the Beast. The Christians know it as the Devil, and the Buddhists as the ego. You can consider it a metaphor if you like, but it is as real as anything you can touch. The hardest part is seeing that you somehow always knew that you were in on the grand conspiracy, even as you convinced yourself that you weren't, or that you wouldn't have to confront this awful truth.

But it is not all bad news — not by a long shot. For once you make it through the depths of Hell, you discover that at your core, you are pure infinite Love. You never wanted to hurt anyone; in fact you never could want such a thing. But you were deeply confused, and in your confusion, created endless suffering for yourself and others. Everybody else was, too. That's why they couldn't help you see through your confusion, to your true nature. Instead, they pulled you down into the pit where they were trapped, not knowing any better. Except for a handful of people who had seen the truth. These are the ones who refused to forsake you even when you had given up on yourself. They showed you kindness even when you didn't deserve it, because they could see that kindness isn't something one can deserve. In fact, it is never truly directed at anyone; but only at reality as a whole. It is nothing but allegiance with the Light instead of the darkness. It can never be the wrong thing.

It is impossible to overstate the capacity for humans to lie to ourselves. Nowhere is this more clear than in our response to the phenomenon we call "evil."

People are only able to cause [...]



This vicious cycle is not an accident; it is secretly orchestrated by a kind of parasite deep within our minds. This parasite hides itself from our conscious minds while displaying itself conspicuously to our enemies, tricking us both into behaving in exactly the ways it needs to spread itself. Any time you contemptuously judge another person for falling victim to this mind-virus, you are secretly falling for it yourself. There are no exceptions. Any action you take from a place of malice, contempt, or self-righteousness _will_ darken the world. No matter how careful you are to avoid this trap, your subconscious will find a backdoor that you will not discover until it is too late for you to make amends.

All of humanity is caught in a kind of giant "Mexican standoff." We are holding guns to each other's heads, convinced that if we could just destroy the evil "out there," we would finally have peace — not realizing that it is our death grip on these guns that keeps the whole game alive. We fear that if we put down _our_ guns, we ourselves would get shot — and in a way, we are right. If we just decided to be sweet and gentle with the "evil people," we would be making things worse. 


---

The reason that we pretend that we are; that we mock and shame our enemies; is to provoke them into _worse_ behavior. By proving that they are _fundamentally morally defective_, we license ourselves to behave in self-serving ways, as well as to escalate our nastiness. This behavior is itself profound self-deception, which, paradoxically, is what provokes them. We are telegraphing our own inner darkness, via a hidden channel, to _their_ inner darkness, providing it with the justification it needs to convince them to give in to it, while simultaneously preventing us from realizing that we are doing this.

In other words, our mere intention to provoke their darkness secretly reveals our own, thereby actually provoking theirs. To say it again: our hidden desire to provoke darkness in others is all that is required to actually do so, in a way that convinces us that it's entirely their fault, so that we can better hide our darkness from ourselves.

You may believe that you have no intention to provoke darkness in others, but you have no idea how sneaky your darkness is. The mere decision to feel contempt for another person; to view them as fundamentally defective; or to see their evil as intrinsic, is always your mind finding justification to engage in some dark behavior that you would otherwise be unable to. Until you see this clearly, it is literally impossible to reduce the evil in the world; it is only possible to create more, while also feeling flawlessly certain that you are doing no such thing. Seeing how your own darkness is tricking you is the key that unlocks your ability to see how it has commandeered other people's minds, and therefore how to be of genuine service in fighting it.

Actually, it's much worse: our darknesses aren't truly separate. They behave more like outgrowths of a singular distributed malevolent entity, slipping freely between our subconscious minds, manipulating us all into creating Hell on Earth without anyone realizing its true origin. Or rather, every one of us knows who the problem is, but somehow it's always somebody else. The Darkness keeps our attention fixated outwards on the evil "out there," precisely so that we will never look too closely "in here," at the one place where we actually have complete control over it. It is the primordial evil global conspiracy, and it lives deep within the crevices of our minds; the last place we would ever look.



At the deepest level, it is possible to realize that you _are_ everyone and everything, in a profound and surprising sense; and that any harm you cause to anyone ultimately happens to everyone. Every time we are unkind to anyone for any reason; any time we engage in self-deception, we are secretly feeding the Beast. Seeing this in its entirety is known as enlightenment, but all of us can sense it to some degree or another at all times. All self-deception, and therefore all evil, is ultimately rooted in the misperception that we are fundamentally separate; from each other, and from "nature." The darker a mind, the less able they are to perceive the life in others; and therefore the more easily they justify harming it. This misperception cannot be overcome by more darkness, but only by "shining your inner light" so powerfully that the smoldering ember within them is forced to take notice. This can be gentle, or it can be fierce, but in either case, it can be called Love.

In a sense, your entire impact here can be measured by how much Light you shone vs how much you withheld in the mistaken belief that doing so would somehow dispel the darkness. In the end, perhaps MLK Jr said it best:

...

May we all heed his wise words.

What is it that enabled oil executives to know about the extensive harms of their product and still choose to suppress that knowledge from public consciousness? Did they have some trait called "evil" that the rest of us lack? Or could it be that they are simply the most visible expressions of a quality latent within every one of us? Could it be that our very decision to perceive their malfeasance as strange and foreign is itself a manifestation of that same tendency within ourselves? 

In other words, might it be that our primal need to see ourselves as good and special is the very same quality that enabled them to perpetrate the harms that they did — and that our very attempts to distance ourselves from this grotesque quality are actually what keep it alive? This isn't a mere intellectual hypothesis or curiosity: it is a description of an astonishing insight that lies within every one of us; whose full realization holds the key to civilizational transformation. _We are the oil executives._

That statement has mystical connotations (for reasons that we shall see), but it can also be approached conventionally. Our civilization's need for the comforts that only fossil fuels could bring necessitates the existence of individuals who can supply those resources to us without forcing us to become consciously aware of their harms (which would conflict with those needs). It is as though this cumulative need within all of us — for comfort without confronting its true origins and implications — amassed itself into the shape of Big Evil Corporations capable of quietly fulfilling it. To turn around and scapegoat them would be to perpetuate the very mistake that conjured them into existence in the first place. We should practically be _thanking_ those executives for fulfilling the role that we left open for them.

This is a subtle point and easily misunderstood. Of course specific people made profoundly unethical (and in some cases criminal) choices that only they can (and should) be held accountable for. But unless and until we can "see ourselves in their eyes," we are just asking for their shoes to be filled by others who can serve as outward manifestations of our inward qualities. It is the _contempt_ with which we judge them that ultimately determines how likely we are to have to repeat the process in the future. By seeing them as completely unlike us, we secretly license ourselves to continue to harbor the very qualities we detest in them. This isn't something I can convince you of, but you can learn to see it in yourself. The secret purpose of contempt is to _hide our own darkness from ourselves_.

We all instinctively know that genuinely wise people — those who are free of self-deception — don't treat others with contempt. Or if they do, that it is only contempt for the person's behaviors or beliefs, and never for the person — who they ultimately want only the best for. Not in the sense of wishing that their delusional egoic desires come true, but in wishing them free of the bizarre mental illness that is our darkness. **Contempt is secretly a way to shove people deeper into the dark in a way that appears noble.** It is evil, and they can sense this — which lets them feel more justified in fighting back however they feel they must. And because we "don't know" that we're doing this, their recalcitrance becomes reason for us to escalate.

In other words, our contempt for other people exists only to encourage contempt in them and others, so that all of us can feel increasingly licensed to engage in self-serving behaviors that we don't recognize in ourselves but that others recognize in us, which triggers more contempt, etc. The darkness in all of our minds is collaborating to keep itself hidden from us while it devours this world. It is the primordial evil global conspiracy, and what keeps it hidden is that none of us are willing to admit our own role, because our own complicity in the horrors of this world is too great for us to confront. Every time we have ever been unkind to anyone, seen them as inferior, or otherwise engaged in any kind of self-deception, we have secretly but knowingly been darkening the world. It is the most painful thing possible to confront, so instead of confronting it, we keep our attention fixated outwards, on all the evil "out there" that we must valiantly destroy.

This is especially true of the "evil people."

It is only possible to be unkind to another being by hiding something from ourselves. The very deepest part of us knows that we are all intimately connected, and that what we do to anyone ultimately happens to everyone. In fact, in a profound and astonishing sense, we _are_ everyone and everything — but we convincingly pretend not to know this. It is as though the deepest aspect of our mind is already enlightened, but we studiously avoid consciously recognizing it so that we can play out the game of being unenlightened.



In other words, we treat our enemies with contempt not _despite_ the fact that it makes them dig in their heels, but _because_ of it. It feels good to have people to mock and shame. It's not that mockery and shaming are _intrinsically_ wrong; it's that we make sure to perform them in a way that triggers people's defense mechanisms, but allow us to feel like we were only trying to help either them or the world. This enables us to hide the darkness within our own minds by keeping our fingers continually pointed outwards. You have _no idea_ how much cruel and self-serving behavior you can justify when you have a righteous excuse for it. But you will not recognize that you are doing this until it is too late. The belief that you could never slide down this slippery slope is precisely what makes you slide down it.

This is the secret trick behind evil. By hiding itself carefully from our own minds while displaying itself conspicuously to others, it convinces each of us that unkindness towards certain people is not just okay, but positively righteous. It prevents us from seeing that we are trapped in precisely the same dark pattern that they are — and that by acting out that pattern on them, we are secretly amplifying it _in_ them. We are all doing this to each other, and therefore to ourselves.



It _is_ your responsibility to fight evil, but not in the way you've probably been taught, because it is our collective darkness that has been teaching us, through revenge fantasy films like The Equalizer and YouTube videos of "Karens getting owned." If you really want to fight evil, the first thing you must do is to root out the self-deception in your own mind. This is the only way to guarantee that what you call "fighting evil" isn't just a secret excuse to further your own dark hidden agendas — agendas that are hidden even from yourself.

The more you free your own mind, the more you perceive the surprising sense in which even the most evil person ultimately doesn't want to be evil. You begin to perceive the part of them that wants to be free of the mind-virus that has enslaved humanity, and you increasingly see how you always have the choice of quietly shoving them further into its dark grip or using your unique gifts to help free them from it. You _know_ you can get away with the former, but it begins to lose its appeal. 

The latter is called compassion, and it doesn't mean being nice. Compassion can be fierce or even violent, if necessary — but it cannot contain even a trace of malice, contempt, or self-righteousness. This unshakable integrity from a place beyond your egoic mind prevents the darkness in their mind from finding an excuse to justify itself. It is thereby weakened at least a little, and their inner light begins to shine through more and more.

There is a lot to say about the topic of compassion. It requires considerable wisdom to be effective, especially with people whose minds are deeply infected by the virus.

Every one of us behaves in self-deceptive ways. We skirt our consciences, and then pretend that we don't. To prevent ourselves from discovering the full extent of our own complicity, we hold each other hostage: we contemptuously judge each other for doing exactly the same thing by pretending that it's something fundamentally different. Part of us wants to believe that we're combating a bit of darkness "out there" to offset our own — but we secretly know that this behavior _deepens_ other people's need to hide their self-deception from themselves, thereby _increasing_ evil. This behavior is therefore _itself_ profound self-deception. In fact, that is why it works: it provokes them into contemptuously judging _us,_ which "proves" to us that they're evil, thus accomplishing its secret goal: to prove our intrinsic superiority.

In truth, there is no darkness "in here" and darkness "out there"; there is only the one Darkness, comprising the shadow aspects of _all_ of our minds, working together like a single _distributed malevolent entity._ It is variously known as the Devil, the "evil global conspiracy," or simply "human nature." It is the _primordial_ evil conspiracy; the one to which all the rest owe their existence, and to which they ultimately filter up. Almost everything we do to "fight" it is secretly in its service.

Kindness is any behavior that weakens the Beast, and unkindness is any behavior that empowers it. Any time you feel malice, contempt (for _people_), or self-righteousness, it is the Darkness masquerading as the Light. The Light is not something soft or weak, and it does not have to be nice. Those are lies that the Darkness tells to keep you from discovering its true power. In truth, your Light is the only thing that actually dispels the Darkness. The surest sign that you're acting from it is that you feel not a trace of superiority. You recognize evil for what it ultimately is (self-deception), and are able to perceive — not just believe, but _perceive_ — the aspect of people that wants to be free of it. It is your willingness to not give up on them even when they have given up on themselves that begins to weaken its grip on the world. Again, this doesn't have to be nice: it can be fierce or even violent. Any other behavior may temporarily suppress the darkness, but ultimately empowers it.

A deep part of us knows all of this to be true. Until we are honest with ourselves about it, we are

A deep part of us knows that people only misbehave due to self-deception, and recognizes our similarity with them. To hide this, another part chooses to perceive them as _fundamentally defective_, so that we feel contempt. It feels like the contempt is there to "teach them a lesson" or otherwise benefit the world — but if you look carefully enough, you'll find that this is a dark lie.

Contempt (for people) secretly exists to provoke _worse_ behavior, so we can prove that they are defective, which licenses more contempt, etc. We hide this knowledge from ourselves, which target subconsciously recognizes as self-deception, and it makes them see _us_ as evil for exactly the same reason we see them that way. This makes them feel _more_ justified in their misbehavior — and since we "don't know" that we're doing this, that serves as evidence that they are defective. _Mission accomplished_.

The mere subconscious intention to provoke evil is sufficient to actually do so. In fact, there is a more general principle at work: engaging in any kind of self-deception secretly (but knowingly) induces others to do the same. We engage in a million tiny self-serving behaviors that we convince ourselves are "no big deal" or that somehow stick it to the "bad people," blissfully unaware that the cumulative effect is to _empower_ theirs, so that we can feel increasingly justified in ours.

Looking at the state of our world, it almost feels like there's an _evil global conspiracy_ running the show from behind the scenes. In a sense, there is. There is but one Darkness, manifesting through all of our minds, behaving like a single _distributed malevolent entity,_ hiding itself perfectly from view. It is the _primordial_ evil conspiracy; the one to which all the rest owe their existence, and to which they ultimately filter up. Almost everything we do to "fight" it is secretly in its service.

It is what some cultures know as the Devil, and it is as "real" as anything you can touch. It lives in the crevices of our minds; the dark places that we'd rather not look, communicating with itself beneath our conscious awareness. Every act of unkindness ripples through its terrible body, lowering the threshold for darkness to manifest elsewhere; emerging as atrocities that we not only don't recognize our own connection to, but that actually provoke _self-righteous outrage_, inspiring us to pile on more.

Others simply know it as "human nature"; the indisputable "fact" that we are fundamentally greedy and selfish creatures, and thus deserving of whatever horrible fate befalls us. The Darkness knows exactly how to manipulate each mind so that we feel powerless to confront it, and justified in harboring our own little piece, for fear of being the only chumps missing out on its tainted rewards. It uses your own inner voice to convince you that it's _you_, but it's not — it is a _parasite._

Kindness has nothing to do with being nice. It is simply about recognizing this dark trap that humanity is caught in, and refusing to perpetuate it, despite how easy it is to get away with these days. It is about discovering all the places within us that allow the Darkness to hide, and healing them, so that we don't spread it in our zeal to violently demolish it. It is about seeing how even the worst people aren't _intrinsically_ evil; how this perception exists _only_ as a trick that "their" darkness uses to elicit "ours."

---

Underneath all the self-deception is your pure, infinite Love for all of reality. This is what you most fundamentally _are._ It is not something soft and weak: that is a lie the Darkness tells to prevent you from discovering its full power. It is a Love that excludes nothing and forsakes no-one — including the target of its fearsome wrath, should that become necessary. It can take on almost any form whatsoever. At its most intense, it can appear almost indistinguishable from the Darkness itself — _almost_.

It is this apparent difficulty that allows the Darkness to sneak back into our minds, mimicking the voice of our inner Light. But part of us can always distinguish them. Our agendas and ideologies; thoughts and beliefs, cannot tell us which voice we are listening to, no matter how well-intentioned they are. There is exactly one thing deep within us that Knows, and it is always there if we _just look_. We can pretend not to hear it, but in the end, we discover that we were only fooling ourselves.

At the ultimate level, you _are_ everyone and everything, in a profound and surprising sense. Realizing this in its entirety is known as _enlightenment_ (en-Light-enment), but all of us can sense it to some degree or another at all times. It is why we sometimes thank others for being generous with strangers even when no (apparent) benefit accrues to us. At some level, we can feel that what happens to any of us ultimately happens to all of us. In the same way, forsaking any one of us forsakes us all.

People are deeply, badly confused. It is only our Darkness that feels any satisfaction in relegating them to the abyss as a sort of punishment. In truth, we are only punishing ourselves. Some part of us is not ready to come Home yet, and unkindness is the secret tool we use to keep the illusion alive.

In the same way that acting from Darkness inevitably spreads the Darkness, acting from the Light spreads the Light. In fact, there aren't really two things there: the Darkness is ultimately nothing but the absence of Light; our willingness to hide from it. Perhaps MLK said it best:

> *Darkness cannot drive out darkness, only light can do that. Hate cannot drive out hate, only love can do that.* ―Martin Luther King, Jr.

Every one of us has benefited from the grace of countless others, including those who have shown us kindness even when we didn't "deserve" it — and even when we couldn't recognize it as kindness at the time. We can in turn share that grace and hold the Light for others, especially when they themselves cannot, in whatever form that Light must take given its unique circumstances. There's nothing much else worth doing in this place.

I am far from enlightened myself and have no right to lecture anyone. All I know is that it would be a shame not to share this insight that befell me, and all I ask is that you hold my feet to the fire when I inevitably forget.

What if nearly everything you're doing to "fight evil" is actually strengthening it — and moreover, what if part of you already knows this but is actively concealing it from your conscious mind?

We don't hate "bad people" for how different they are, but for how similar. We treat them with contempt in hopes of provoking _worse_ behavior, to prove how bad they are — but for that to work, we must hide it from ourselves, because it's obviously evil. But they can subconsciously sense our self-deception, which makes them perceive _us_ as evil, further justifying their misbehavior. And since we "don't know" that we're doing this, we take this as proof that they really are evil, thus accomplishing our secret goal.

In other words, the mere subconscious intention to provoke evil is sufficient to actually do so — and this is just one of the countless ways it does that. If we are not in direct contact with our enemies, we induce contempt in our allies. One way or another, our darkness finds a way to leak into the world. The goal is to generate a dark cover behind which our own self-deception can hide. By keeping our attention fixated on the evil "out there," our darkness prevents us from looking too closely at what is happening "in here" — the one place where we have complete power over it.




Our minds keep searching for a way to eat our cake and have it, too; to get to feel malice, contempt, and self-righteousness for our enemies without the "collateral damage" that we deep down know it causes. But this is impossible. No matter how well we hide it, the Darkness _always_ leaks. Every act of self-deception lowers the threshold for darkness to manifest elsewhere; every unkindness makes it more likely that _genuine atrocities_ will be committed by someone, somewhere, in a way that we will never connect back to ourselves; indeed, that we can use as justification to pile on more.

Looking at the state of the world, you could be forgiven for believing that there's an _evil global conspiracy_ pulling the strings from behind the scenes. In a sense, there is — but it's not the one that you're probably thinking of.

If you look deeply enough into your mind while hating _anyone_, you'll find that your mind is secretly attempting to darken the world by increasing its net animosity, but in a way that appears _righteous_. In fact, the mere subconscious intention to darken the world is sufficient to actually do so. The mechanism is fiendishly clever — and it doesn't even require hatred.

Simply by feeling _contempt_ (for people), you are secretly telegraphing a dark intention to the world. This makes your allies feel compelled to join your noble mission, while your enemies perceive it as _evil_ for precisely the same reason that you see them that way, which makes them feel increasingly justified in their behavior. And since you don't know that you're doing this, this in turn vindicates your contempt and licenses escalation.

This is how the Darkness spreads itself while convincing us that we're fighting it. It tells us that "compassion" is something weak and naive; to be reserved for the "innocent." In truth, every person's mind has a shadow aspect, and compassion is nothing but the firm resolve to _heal_ it instead of reinforcing it under the guise of "good." Such compassion need not be nice or gentle: it can be as fierce or even violent as the situation warrants.

Genuine compassion (aka kindness) can look like almost anything at all. The more entrenched the darkness it is fighting, the harder it becomes to tell apart fom Darkness — and therefore, the easier it gets to lie to ourselves about our true intentions. This is how the Darkness keeps sneaking in the back door. If you feel even a _trace_ of malice, self-righteousness, or contempt (for the _person_), then your darkness is secretly running the show.

With increasing sensitivity, we become able to perceive its presence in ever-subtler ways. Think back to a time that you skirted your conscience. Part of you knew perfectly well that you were doing wrong, but the full implications of your behavior were very cleverly shielded from conscious self-reflection. It is this very mechanism that has enabled _all the evil there ever was_ — and every time we engage in it, we covertly license others to do the same.

Looking at the state of the world, you could be forgiven for believing that there's an _evil global conspiracy_ pulling the strings behind the scenes. In a sense, there is — but it's not the one that you're probably thinking of.

It is the Darkness, and it is _insanely_ clever: it knows how to manipulate you into believing that it is your friend even as you feel contempt for others who have been similarly fooled — the "bad people." In fact, the contempt _is_ the manipulation: simply by feeling it, you are telegraphing to them that you are under its dark sway, which convinces them that _you_ are bad. And since you don't know that you're doing this, this "proves" that your contempt was justified, and licenses escalation. It is the _perfect_ trap.

But part of you _does_ know that you're doing it — it's just that you're _hiding_ it from yourself. In fact, it is the hiding that makes it "dark" in the first place. All the Darkness in the world ultimately boils down to people trying to hide from their own consciences — including our hatred for them, which is a clever attempt to hide from our own. It can only make the world darker, because that is its secret purpose.

The cumulative effect of billions of people disowning their own darkness has enabled it to take a life of its own. It behaves like a _malevolent distributed entity._ It is this that we are subconsciously sensing when we suspect the existence of an "evil global conspiracy." All the conspiracies that you can identify "out there" are merely its outer reflections — one that your own mind is secretly in on. You can take this as an allegory, but you can also learn to perceive it clearly and directly.

That is why the greatest gift you can offer the world is to heal the parts of you that are still engaging in self-deception. The more you engage in it, the more you induce the same behavior in others; and vice versa. If you try to "fight evil" before healing your own, you can _only_ create more while feeling flawlessly convinced that it is helping.

Given the nature of self-deception, how can you be sure if it's still operating in you? A good litmus test is how much malice, self-righteousness, and contempt (for other people) that you are able to feel. These are always signs that you're hiding something from yourself, somewhere.

That is why kindness is the right motivation in every circumstance, with no exceptions. It has nothing to do with being _nice._ It is simply what remains when self-deception is gone, and the only thing that genuinely fights it. It can be as gentle or fierce — or even _violent_ — as the situation warrants. But it is always aware of its true enemy, which it never misperceives as being _intrinsic_ to minds — because that is its most insidious trap; the way it gets you to feel _contempt._


---

Here's a difficult truth: any society in which people enjoy mocking conspiracy theorists and flat-Earthers, watching "Karens get owned," etc., is necessarily also one in which "evil elites" run the show. They are reflections of the same dark phenomenon.

We tell ourselves that we hate and mock stupid and evil people because of the good it accomplishes, but the truth is that we see in them an element of ourselves that we can't yet accept, and so we lash out at them to _reinforce_ theirs as a way of hiding from our own. They subconsciously recognize this as self-deception — the same phenomenon ultimately responsible for the issues that we're contemptuously judging them for — which makes them feel compelled to reciprocate, which we take as proof that we were right about them, because we can't see that we wanted this.

What's heartbreaking is that part of us _can_ see it. It knows that we're pumping hostility into the world as a coping mechanism, which we then disown, so that when it comes boomeranging back in various forms, we cannot recognize it as our own creation, thus "forcing" us to escalate. There is a tiny part of our minds that recognizes the horrific trap that we're perpetuating, yet can't help but reinforce it. That part does not deserve to be shoved deeper into the abyss, despite the evil it knowingly creates.

 What is this Darkness?

Looking at the state of the world, one might suspect that there is an evil entity secretly pulling the strings behind the scenes. Call it the Devil, the "evil global conspiracy," or simply human nature. In truth, it is the disowned aspect of all of our minds together acting as a unit; behaving like a _distributed malevolent entity_. You can treat this as an allegory, but you can also learn to perceive it clearly and directly. It lives deep in the crevices of our minds, communicating with itself beneath our conscious thresholds.

It is the _primordial_ evil conspiracy; the one to which all the rest owe their existence, and to which they ultimately filter up. Almost everything we do to "fight" it is secretly in its service. It keeps us fixated on the evil "out there" to take our attention off of what is happening "in here" — the one place where we actually have full power over it. It convinces us that compassion is something weak and naive, so that we never take it seriously enough to discover its true strength.

From this perspective, compassion is nothing but the resolution to fight _against_ the Darkness instead of secretly fighting _for_ it. This is only possible to the degree that we've unearthed all the places it hides in our own minds, using our pain as a cover. The more we uncover it, the more clearly we see how it has cleverly hijacked other minds. We don't have to stop ourselves from feeling contempt; it is _obviously_ just the darkness trying to regain a foothold.

We think that hating "bad people" is a sign of the good within us, but it's actually a sign of something much darker.

We hate this behavior in others because it subconsciously reminds us of our own darkness. To hide this similarity, our mind does something _insanely_ clever: it makes us perceive and treat them as _fundamentally defective_, which they subconsciously recognize as self-deception, thus triggering their "evil" detector, which compels them to return the favor. But we don't know that we're doing this, so we take it as proof that we were right about them, thus licensing escalation.

In other words, our subconscious intention to drive the darkness deeper into people's minds is sufficient to actually do so. In fact, there's a more general principle at work: any time we act from self-deception of any sort, we induce the same tendency in others, friend or foe. This is how the Darkness spreads without anyone recognizing their own complicity. It is the _perfect_ trap.

Every act of unkindness lowers the threshold for _genuine atrocities_ to be committed by someone, somewhere, in a way that we will never consciously connect back to our own behavior — in fact, that we will take as justification to pile on more. Of course, unkindness _can_ suppress other people's misbehavior — at least, their _public_ misbehavior, for a time. We can thus easily convince ourselves that it "worked," but only because we choose not to look too carefully at its full implications.

Looking at the state of humanity, you could swear that there is an evil entity secretly pulling the strings behind the scenes. Call it the Devil, the "evil global conspiracy," or simply human nature. In truth, it is the disowned aspect of all of our minds acting as a cohesive unit; behaving like a distributed malevolent entity. You can treat this as an allegory, but you can also learn to perceive it clearly and directly. 

It is the _primordial_ evil conspiracy; the one to which all the rest owe their existence, and to which they ultimately filter up. Almost everything we do to "fight" it is secretly in its service. It keeps our attention fixated on the evil "out there" so that never look too closely "in here" — the one place where we actually have full power over it.



The painful truth is that any society in which contempt for other people is considered healthy and normal is effectively guaranteed to have "evil elites" running the show. Both are outward manifestations of the same inward sickness. The more we heal it, and the kinder the world becomes, the harder it gets for either phenomenon to take root; the less place there is for the Darkness to hide.

Genuine kindness can be fierce, or possibly even violent if the situation warrants. It can even use mocking and shaming in the right circumstances. Almost nothing is off-limits. But it cannot contain even a _trace_ of malice, contempt (for the person), or self-righteousness, because those are _always_ signs of the Darkness operating. Its deep integrity prevents other people's darkness from finding the excuse it would otherwise use to justify itself. This is how the Light spreads.

At the ultimate level, you _are_ everyone and everything, in a profound and surprising sense. Realizing this in its entirety is known as _enlightenment_ (en-Light-enment), but all of us can sense it to some degree or another at all times. It is why we sometimes thank others for being generous with strangers even when no (apparent) benefit accrues to us. At some level, we can feel that what happens to any of us affects all of us.

Our true enemy is never other people, but only the darkness in their minds. The more we become aware of our own, the more clearly we see this. Forsaking any one of us forsakes all of us. We only behave this way because we're not ready to come Home yet ourselves, and distancing ourselves from others is a powerful way to keep the illusion alive. This is the true origin of contempt, and thus, of evil.

The more we are able to heal our own self-deception, the more we begin to perceive what is preventing others from giving up theirs, finally enabling us to fight evil in ways that don't secretly reinforce it. This is why the greatest gift that we can offer the world is our own healing, and the extension of that same grace to others — however gentle or fierce it need be.

I wish I had a nugget of wisdom to share about real, practical ways to put this knowledge to use. Alas, I am a mere fledgling myself, and true wisdom is the work of a lifetime. All I know is that I wish to stop playing the dark game that we have inherited, and exchange it for a more beautiful one. I only hope that you will join me — and that you will hold my feet to the fire when I (pretend to) forget myself.

But even if we manage to violently eradicate our enemies, the profound darkness required to do so will powerfully awaken the shadows of everyone whose mind it touches, directly or indirectly, friend or foe, resulting in a darker world. This isn't an unfortunate side effect of otherwise-noble intentions: _it is secretly the whole point._

The Darkness exists only to spread itself, which it does with ruthless efficiency. It manipulates our minds so perfectly that we never suspect that we're obeying it. We just feel like we are "fighting evil." Its core trick is to make other people appear _fundamentally defective,_ so that harming them feels unmistakably righteous. Any time you act from this perception rather than from your profound Love for reality, you _will_ darken the world in some way that you will be unable to notice.

The Darkness tells you that Love is something gentle and weak; tolerant and permissive, but this is a nasty lie. Authentic Love is fierce and unrelenting in the face of evil, but it is always free of self-deception. It never mistakes evil as being intrinsic to minds; it recognizes it as the self-deception that it is, and its deep integrity prevents that self-deception from finding the "hook" it would otherwise use to justify itself. It is not as darkly satisfying as malice, but it actually nudges the world closer to what you most deeply desire: a world free of the Darkness.

This isn't some fantasy world that is magically free of conflict, but one in which we've learned that malice, contempt (for people), and even self-righteousness exist only to turn conflict _bitter,_ so as to provide cover for more self-deception. We recognize this when politicians start wars to line their pockets under the illusion of "fighting evil," or turn us against each other to distract from what they're doing, but don't yet see how our own dark behavior secretly promotes those very tendencies.

It knows that the more carefully you look inside, the more you will expose its dirty trick, and the more you will be able to free others of it.


---

Have you noticed how hard it is to fight evil without making things worse? It's because a hidden part of our mind _wants_ to make things worse. Having something to fight forms a core part of most humans' identity — but so does being a "good person." So that part of our mind finds ways to accomplish this without our conscious minds suspecting it.

Even "bad people"'s minds must distort the full implications of their misbehavior to make it feel okay. They're caught in a much deeper version of the same trap that we are, such that we do not consciously recognize the similarity.

This is just one of the ways our darkness leaks out. If our enemy isn't present, then our contempt darkens the minds of our "allies." Any time we engage in self-deception of any kind, our mind is powerfully inviting everyone else into the same shadowy space, friend or foe, to express their unique brand of self-deception. The darkness in all of our minds is _collaborating,_ as a way to spread itself beneath our conscious thresholds in a way that each person can deny.

Unkindness only ever empowers it, because unkindness is always self-deception. Kindness doesn't mean being _nice_: that's just a lie that the Darkness tells to prevent you from discovering the full extent of its power. It simply means being free of self-deception. From here, it is impossible to feel contempt for anybody, because you now recognize evil as a profound form of confusion; one that contempt is secretly designed to intensify.

MLK once said that "darkness cannot drive out darkness," but is it true? If so, why? And just what makes something "dark," anyway?

Hating our enemies is _dark_ — not (just) in the sense of being bad, but in the sense of being self-deceptive. We subconsciously recognize what their minds are really doing, and know that by viciously attacking them, we will drive that tendency _deeper in_. At the same time, we pretend that we're doing it to _reduce_ evil in the world. This discrepancy alerts their subconscious to _our_ self-deception, which triggers their "evil detector," compelling them to return the favor.

In other words, our subconscious intention to drive their darkness deeper in is enough to actually get the job done. And since this knowledge is blocked from our consciousness, it opens a new door: we can take their recalcitrance as evidence that they are indeed _fundamentally defective_, which licenses us to escalate. The knowledge that it is not "intrinsic evil" but self-deception is still available to us, but now we have even more plausible deniability.

I say "we" have, but this dark aspect of our mind is actually a mental parasite, and extrinsic to the mind. If we could clearly see how it is cleverly manipulating humanity into destroying itself, we would immediately turn against it. So it must hide itself at all costs, which it does by manipulating our perceptions such that we can't help but see other people as _intrinsically evil._ In this way, our collective Darkness behaves like a _distributed malevolent entity_.

Every time we are triggered by another person's darkness, theirs is secretly recruiting ours. We then become beacons of darkness without knowing it. It ripples out into the world in astonishing ways, "disappearing" into the far corners, enticing others to behave in ways that will trigger our self-righteous indignation, thus keeping the cycle going.

The real fight against evil begins with undoing our misperception of others. The more that happens, the less you settle for "they're just evil" as an explanation, forcing you to confront the immense network of causes and conditions that convinced them to adopt the Darkness as if it were their friend. It's not their friend, and it's not yours. Malice, contempt, and self-righteousness are _never_ in the service of humanity, but only ever in service of the Darkness.

Such compassion can be fierce or even violent if necessary, but it is rooted in a profound Love for all of reality. This isn't something soft and gooey, but is a blinding Light that excludes nothing and forsakes no-one — including the target of its wrath. The darker the situation, the more fierce it must be — until it begins to look almost indistinguishable from our darkness. _Almost_. Part of us always knows. Thus, everything comes down to resolving never to stray from that part.


---

The dark glee we feel when watching "bad people" get harmed is exactly the same feeling they have when harming innocent people. Not _similar_, but the _same_. It is a mild form of malevolence. Malevolence is really good at two things: (1) hiding itself from you and (2) displaying itself to others in a way that induces it in them.

This means that your mind will actively spread evil while making it seem righteous. You won't "know" that you're doing this, which is how other people will subconsciously detect that you're in a state of self-deception, which is what induces theirs. This is why we mock and shame our enemies: we know it will make them dig in their heels, and the darkness in our mind _needs_ more enmity to keep itself alive.

The Darkness is using us as a vehicle to spread itself. It is a kind of mind-virus. It works by making you hate other infected people, thereby infecting more people. The antidote is to see that they are indeed _infected_; that the darkness is not intrinsic to their minds. That is the illusion. It is what makes you feel malice, self-righteousness, and contempt — the core weapons of Darkness.

Please don't let it win. There's a part of you that knows how to fight it. It is the part of you that is always kind, but not always nice. It is the only thing free of self-deception, and therefore the only thing that actually reduces it.

---

We think that hating "bad people" is a sign of the good within us, but it's actually a sign of something _much darker_.

...

It turns out almost everything humans do to "fight evil" is self-deception. We mock and shame our enemies not _despite_ the fact that it makes them dig in their heels, but because of it. It's _fun_ to watch them squirm, and satisfying to be "forced" to escalate. Or maybe we cleverly take advantage of some company, convinced that we're only harming its wealthy (and greedy) owners — only to discover that they aren't so wealthy after all, or that our behavior subtly harmed many innocent people indirectly. But our mind finds an excuse for those too — or else blocks that knowledge entirely from conscious awareness.

It's **very hard** to own up to the darkness "in here," so our subconscious actively seeks it "out there," using it as an excuse to create _more_, to provide a smokescreen for our own. This is _even harder_ to admit, so we push it even harder out of consciousness. All this "pushing out of consciousness" subconsciously propagates outward, inducing darkness in others; both "friends" and "foes." With enough sensitivity, you can learn to perceive this continual dark activity rippling throughout humanity, beneath our conscious thresholds. It seems to have a terrifying kind of intelligence of its own, and is playing us like marionettes. **It is this cumulative Darkness that secretly runs the world from behind the scenes.** 

In any society that's unaware of this, there will _necessarily_ be places where the Darkness accumulates especially intensely, and which act as lighting rods for ours. In our society, they are the "evil elites." It's not that they are innocent, of course; it's that their self-deception incites ours to induce others' etc., eventually cycling back to them. But they aren't the _source_ of it; they are simply nodes in a cycle that we all secretly perpetuate. The part of our mind that hates them exists specifically to empower them while appearing to fight them.

The only thing that actually fights Darkness is the part of your mind that is entirely free from it. It is your Inner Light, and it's neither naive nor weak: **those are lies that your darkness tells you.** The Light can be fierce or even violent when necessary, but it is completely incapable of giving rise to malice, self-righteousness, or contempt (for _people_), because those are only ever weapons of the Darkness. You could also call it Love. Not "love" in the conventional sense (which is sweet and gooey) but a fierce Love for all of reality that excludes nothing and forsakes no-one, _including the target of its wrath_.

Action taken from this place has a fundamentally different effect on reality. This is hard to describe, but the deepest part of you already knows it. Its deep integrity prevents other people's self-deception from finding the "hook" needed to justify itself, which halts the spread of darkness instead of encouraging it. This is why your intentions matter far more than you can possibly know. Not your conscious, surface-level intentions — which come from your agendas and ideologies, and tend to be secretly self-serving. Those are what the "road to hell" are paved with. But your _very deepest_ intentions are a different matter.

All of these revenge fantasy films and "Karens getting owned" YouTube videos are far from harmless fun — as are the constant casual cruelty and contempt we find online. They are symptoms of, and drivers for, the evil that we claim to be extinguishing from society. We need better messages for ourselves (and our children) than vague, pious-sounding platitudes about why we should be compassionate to evildoers. There is no "should" here: if we want to end evil, we must learn to clearly see what we are doing to sustain it.

---

"Bad people" are the perfect excuse for our own darkness to manifest, because it's so easy to find an angle from which it looks righteous. But our dark behavior doesn't only (or even _mostly_) harm them. It is a secret invitation for _everyone_ — friend or foe — to manifest their own unique brands of self-deception, creating a smokescreen behind which ours can hide. The cumulative effect is a dark world for which none of us recognize our own contribution, but feel supremely licensed to pile on _more._

It is an _insanely_ clever trap. The Darkness knows exactly how to manipulate our minds to make us believe it is our friend, while making us contemptuously judge others for doing the same. That dark glee you feel when watching "bad people" get hurt is _exactly_ the same thing they feel when harming innocent people, and it has exactly the same effect: it makes everyone more bloodthirsty, and lowers the threshold for genuine atrocities to be committed by someone, somewhere, in a way that we will never recognize our connection to.

We've come to recognize that the elites are playing us off each other, but we somehow don't yet see that the Darkness is playing a _much bigger game._ To divide the world into _fundamentally_ good and bad people is to have already fallen into its most basic trap. That distinction exists **only** to provide it a "foot in the door" from where it bides its time. In truth, there are only people with greater and lesser degrees of self-awareness about their capacity for self-deception, and placing ourselves on the "good" side of that line is _only ever_ an excuse to engage in some dark behavior that we're not yet aware of.

Its most unmistakable signature is _contempt_ — that feeling of being _fundamentally superior_. It doesn't matter how good a reason you have for feeling it, it is _always_ your mind plotting a trajectory to darken the world without you noticing. The way it accomplishes this is fiendishly clever.

---
---

Deep down, we recognize this uncomfortable similarity between ourselves and the "bad people" — and to hide it from ourselves, our minds trick us into perceiving them as _fundamentally defective,_ and thus worthy of contempt. The problem is, they now subconsciously recognize that _we're_ being self-deceptive (i.e., _evil_), which makes them feel _more_ justified in their storyline. This convinces us that we were right about them, thus licensing escalation.

The truth is that part of our minds _knew_ this would happen, and in fact _intended_ it. But we hid this from ourselves. Sound familiar? Contempt — for people, not just their beliefs or behaviors — is inherently self-deceptive, and in this sense, _evil_ — regardless of who it is aimed at. Its sole purpose is to increase the darkness in the world in a way that feels unmistakably righteous, so that we can create more cover for our own self-deception.

It is remarkable how powerful this effect is. Simply by feeling contempt, you are telegraphing to the world that you have entered your own shadow — _and secretly inviting them to join the party_. Your "allies" will feel compelled join you on your noble mission, while your "enemies" will feel the urge to violently attack _you._ Everyone is fighting for Team Darkness, while flawlessly convinced that they are helping. It is an _insanely_ clever trap. 

Each act of unkindness lowers the threshold for the Darkness to manifest elsewhere. Every act of self-deception makes it more likely that genuine atrocities will be committed by someone, somewhere — atrocities for which we will not only feel absolutely no complicity, but which will actually trigger _self-righteous outrage_, inciting us to compound the problem.

To be clear: such behavior can indeed suppress other people's misbehavior — at least, in public, and for a time. We can thus easily convince ourselves that it "worked" — but only because we choose not to look too closely at the full implications of our behavior. It almost feels like something is _encouraging_ us not to look...

---

From a certain perspective, the Darkness appears sentient; even intelligent. The darkness in your mind and mine are _conspiring_ — each one hiding itself perfectly from its host, tricking us each into "fighting" the other in a way that secretly strengthens it.

You have _no idea_ how good your mind is at subtly provoking evil while convincing you that you're doing no such thing. This is how it stays alive: by amplifying the darkness "out there," we become decreasingly likely to look "in here" — the one place where we can actually end it. It is the _perfect_ foe: a _distributed malevolent entity_ that lives deep in the shadows of our minds, subtly manipulating them from within while flawlessly masking its presence.

It is what some cultures know as the Devil  — and it is as "real" as anything you can touch. In more modern terms, it is the _evil global conspiracy_ — that secret cabal responsible for all the world's ills, yet whose full membership remains forever elusive. It is the _primordial_ evil conspiracy; the one to which all the rest owe their existence, and to which they ultimately filter up. They feel "shadowy" because they are outer reflections of our collective unconscious. To believe that you have pinned it down externally is to have fallen into its most basic trap.



It is hard to convince people that they are doing this for _precisely_ the same reason that it's hard to convince the "bad people" that _they_ are doing wrong. To suddenly be exposed to the full extent of our own darkness would demolish our psyches — and who among us is ready for that?

---


If you look closely enough, you will always be able to find the fingerprints of your own darkness imprinted on events distant in time and space; events that you normally feel absolutely no connection to, let alone any complicity for — indeed, the very places that trigger the most self-righteous outrage.

The very deepest part of you knows that you're not _intrinsically_ better than anyone. Fighting evil from this place feels entirely different, and it has a vastly different effect. It robs other people's darkness of the "hook" that it would otherwise use to justify itself. The deeper your integrity, the better this works.

All the hostility we've leaked into the world still lives out there somewhere, where we can judge it from afar, blissfully unaware of our own connection to it. But part of us always knows — and we cannot have the more beautiful world we desire until we acknowledge this and clean it up.

---
---

When we see "evil" in the eyes of another person, something within us feels the urge to violently attack them — even if only emotionally. It feels like that instinct is there to help us "fight evil," but something _much darker_ is actually going on.

By simply engaging in that state, your mind induces darkness in all other minds that witness it. Your allies will feel compelled to join you in your noble mission, while your target (and other enemies) will feel the urge to viciously attack _you_ — thereby providing you with even more evil to righteously battle. The Darkness itself does not care who is harmed, as long as _someone_ is; it is not on anyone's side but its own. It is merely using humanity as a vehicle to spread itself — and we are dutifully obliging.

It tells you that it is fighting for _you_; for the side of _good_ — and it is _completely convincing._ It will even provide you with evidence to "prove" it. Your darkness can indeed suppress other people's misbehavior — at least, in public, and for a time. Thus, you will believe that it worked — but only because you are not looking closely enough.

The darkness in your mind exists to shield you from the full consequences of your behavior, so that you may get away with things that you otherwise could not. This is _exactly_ the state that allows the "bad people" to do what they do: part of them knows perfectly well that they are causing harm, but this knowledge is carefully hidden from conscious self-reflection. All they hear are their own clever justifications. It is this state that has enabled _all the evil there ever was_ — and it has enabled our own misbehavior, if we're honest.

It is not until you see how thoroughly you have been fooled by the Darkness that you begin to appreciate what is happening in the minds of the "bad people" — and why hating them for it is the ultimate trap. It doesn't even require hatred. By simply feeling _contempt_ — the pernicious illusion that you are _fundamentally_ superior; that others are _intrinsically_ defective — you are entering the shadow state, in which your darkness will control you without your knowledge.

But the worst part is that _part of you always knows_. It's not truly unconscious or even subconscious. It is perfectly accessible to consciousness, if only we choose to look. Yet we somehow choose not to look. This is the great tragedy.

Compassion is nothing but the courage to stare your darkness directly in the face, thereby dispelling it. In this state, you are perfectly capable of being fierce or even violent in response to misbehavior, if the situation warrants it. But you will be incapable of feeling even a _trace_ of genuine malice, self-righteousness, or contempt (for _people_) — because you will see clearly that they simply do not have the courage or wisdom to confront their own darkness yet. By standing firm in this resolve, you powerfully induce the Light in others — even those who have forgotten that such a thing exists, let alone within themselves.

Make no mistake: it is far more deliciously satisfying to act from the darkness, and it feels much more compellingly "righteous" to the mind steeped in the story of vengeance. But it is _always_ a trap — and we have no leg to stand on judging others for falling victim to it when we ourselves are still so susceptible.

Your Light is the only thing capable of dispelling darkness from this world, and it is only the darkness that convinces you otherwise. Please do not fight on its side. Humanity — _life_ — desperately needs you.


---

Compassion is the intention to pull others _out_ of this state, whatever may be required — be it gentle or violent — and to thereby extinguish evil from the world. Contempt is the secret desire to shove them deeper in — and to thereby _darken_ the world.

Why would we want to darken it? _To provide cover for our own darkness._ It's really that simple. "Bad people" just give us plausible deniability — and the way it works is insanely clever.

The deepest part of you knows that you're not _intrinsically_ better than anyone. It is your darkness that convinces you that you are, knowing fully well that this will simply trigger them into returning the favor, which will provide you with unmistakable proof that they really _are_ fundamentally defective, etc., in an escalating cycle of violence for which you will feel _absolutely no complicity_. Whatever your mind may tell you, that is the only purpose of contempt — for _people._ Contempt for their beliefs or behaviors is a very different thing, and can actually be compassionate under the right circumstances.

If this distinction seems like splitting hairs, it is only because your darkness is muddying the waters. Again, the deepest part of you knows the difference — and that one of these leads to a darker world, while the other (potentially) leads to a brighter one.

It is also astonishingly easy to lie to ourselves about which one we are doing in any given interaction. Again, this is on purpose: there is a shadowy aspect of our minds that continually confuses the issue, so that we can pretend not to know what we are really doing. This is why almost everything we do to "fight evil" is secretly an attempt to create _more_ in a way that deflects all criticism.

If you look carefully enough, you will see that your darkness and that of the "bad people" is secretly _allied._ Theirs provides an excuse to elicit yours, and vice versa. It is a kind of secret handshake that you can learn to detect.

This mind-state is infectious: simply by engaging in it, the "bad people" induce it in others. The dark part of their mind _wants_ you to hate them — because if it can get you to act unethically, then they will have an easier time justifying their behavior: they can tell themselves that their victims aren't so innocent after all. But hating "bad people" isn't unethical — it's the _opposite_, in fact. So when we do it, and they just double down, it becomes even _more_ obvious that they're evil, which triggers more hatred, etc.

Here's what's really happening. It is impossible to feel hatred — or even _contempt_ — for any other person, good or bad, without entering the self-deceptive state yourself. In that state, you don't just license yourself to hate "bad people," like you tell yourself. Your mind uses that liminal space to get away with all manner of dark hidden desires that it otherwise could not — desires that you may not even realize you have. Every one of us knows deep down that this is how it works — but it is society's best-kept secret; one which we must never speak of.

You will not realize that you've entered this state, but other people can subconsciously tell. In fact, this is the key trick of the darkness: it hides itself perfectly from you while telegraphing it loudly to others. _This_ is the signal that their mind was looking for — and you just gave it to them.

---

Contempt is the pretense that you are _fundamentally better_ than someone — and yet the very deepest part of you knows that you're not. It can sense that you're simply lost in a different section of the very same maze as the "bad people." In fact, the more convinced you are of your fundamental superiority, the more surely your mind is trying to hide something from you. That is what makes contempt (for *people*) such a reliable signal that you have entered your shadow side, regardless of who it is for.

The dark part of your mind is trying to induce this state in others, just like the "bad people" are: the more normalized it becomes, the easier it can hide itself from you. But because of your self-identity as a "good person," it cannot do this in an obvious way. So it makes a big show of being sweet to "victims" and cruel to "perpetrators," knowing perfectly well how the latter will react. It _needs_ them to, to justify more of itself. And it knows that _they_ will secretly know what you are up to, thus completing the cycle — with both of your conscious minds being none the wiser.

How does it know that they will know? Because your darkness and theirs are secretly connected...

---

From a certain perspective, the darkness appears sentient; even intelligent. It is that phenomenon that the ancients knew as the _Devil_[^devil]: a distributed malevolent entity manipulating all of our minds, communicating with itself beneath our conscious thresholds; subtly altering our perceptions, while convincing us that it doesn't exist — or that it doesn't exist within _us_, the righteous. Ironically, this is the _surest_ sign that our mind has been overtaken.

In more modern terms, it is the "evil global conspiracy": a secret cabal pulling all the strings, and yet hidden so well that nobody even suspects its existence — let alone that _part of their own mind is secretly in on it_. It is the _primordial_ evil conspiracy; the one to which all the rest owe their existence, and to which they ultimately filter up — and we are its minions.





---
---

This world is secretly run from the shadows — but not in the way you probably think.

In this state, people appear _evil_ — and it powerfully evokes a similar pattern in us. Our version feels noble — like it is there to protect the innocent — but that's only because we're not looking carefully enough.

The difference between _good_ from _evil_ cannot be found in the content of our thoughts — whether we are doing it to "protect the innocent" or not. It can only be found in the quality of our introspective awareness.

---

[//]: # (There are things &#40;and feelings&#41; that your mind wants, that it has learned to believe it cannot get without dehumanizing others. You instinctively judge this as _evil_, and so your subconscious is forced to dress it up in elaborate, obviously-righteous justifications. In a way, your evaluation is correct: it is the very essence of evil, and exactly what the "bad people" are doing. But at the same time, you really don't want to be doing it, and wouldn't, if you felt that there was another way.)

There is a parasite that has hijacked human minds, whose sole purpose is to create a kind of Hell on Earth. It accomplishes this by darkening our minds, so that we feel okay — or _positively righteous_ — about harming each other. In that darkened state, we license ourselves to get away with _all manner_ of nasty business that doesn't accord with our deepest values. If you look carefully — _and this is hard_ — you'll find that in that state, you're not just hating "bad people": you're angling to gain some advantage for yourself at the expense of the world; something that you feel you deserve but cannot get in any other way. 

Simply by allowing your mind to linger in that shadowy space, something remarkable happens: you _induce_ it in others. It makes the "bad people" feel increasingly justified in their selfish behavior — subconsciously relieved that their victims aren't so "innocent" after all — which in turn licenses the "good people" to feel even more self-righteous outrage to combat this newfound evil. It is a vicious cycle that we know all too well.

There's only one way out of this insane trap — and it's _not_ to be sweet and understanding in the face of evil, if that's what you thought I was going to say.

---

The deepest part of you is fiercely committed to a better, kinder world — whatever the personal cost. Fighting evil from this place feels _vastly_ different from doing it with the viciousness or "edge" described before — and it has a very different impact on everyone whose mind it touches, directly or indirectly, friend or foe. It doesn't induce the shadowy state in them; on the contrary, it robs their parasite of its justification, if only a little. This is the _only_ thing that genuinely dissolves evil instead of secretly reinforcing it.

It is difficult to describe this state, but the deepest part of you already knows it. It feels like an immensely powerful Love — not for your target, exactly, but not really excluding them, either. It is for _reality as a whole_ somehow, because you see that it is the very act of dividing the world into "people who deserve my compassion" and "people who deserve my contempt" that keeps the whole sordid game going. It comes from a mistaken understanding of what compassion really _is_. It's not a gentle or gooey thing: it can be as fierce (or potentially even _violent_) as necessary. Its only defining feature is that it doesn't fall prey to the darkness; to self-deception.

You see that the Darkness behaves like an impersonal force that nonetheless manifests itself through our individual psyches. It is what the ancients knew as the Devil: a distributed malevolent entity that flows freely between minds, signaling to itself beneath our conscious thresholds, defiling everything that it touches. It is why you feel the urge to attack "evil people": their parasite is _recruiting_ you to enter the shadowy space with them, so that you may both act as powerful beacons for the Darkness. It is such an obvious trap when you see it.

This is hard to describe, but people's minds really have been hijacked by the parasite. Even the ones who appear to want it are suffering from a kind of Stockholm Syndrome -- and being unkind to them is allying with their captor, because that very urge comes from your own. You couldn't possibly agree to do it if you could see this.



From this place, there cannot be even a trace of malice, contempt, or self-righteousness. Those are clearly and unmistakably signs of the parasite hijacking your mind.

It may not feel as immediately satisfying as a violent attack, but it actually works _toward_ the goal you most deeply desire: ridding the world of the parasite.

It doesn't have to be any softer or meeker, per se. It can be fierce, or possibly even violent. It's just that the vast majority of times that violence is involved, we're secretly obeying our _parasite_.

[^empathy]: In some people, this mechanism is so strong and automatic that it's simpler to say that they _have_ no empathy.


[//]: # (— even for you, the "good person," but exponentially more so for the "bad people." It's not that they don't know that they're being selfish &#40;or "evil"&#41;; it's that the full implications of this are carefully tucked away in the terrifying maze of their minds.)

---
---

We've all heard that "hate cannot drive out hate," but is it really true? How about something a little milder, like contempt? Surely when it's aimed at _bad people_ it can make the world a better place?



Viewing other people as _fundamentally inferior_ enables you to get away with something that you otherwise could not. It licenses you to behave in self-serving ways that you wouldn't be able to if you could perceive their full humanity. For some, this is about financial gain or the feeling of power, but very often it is (ironically) just to bolster our self-image as "good people."

The problem is that when you do this, other people know exactly what you're up to, because it's a variant of the thing that they are up to. They therefore won't tolerate contempt from the likes of you — regardless of any merit that your words may contain. Instead, you will reinforce the part of them that sees this world as a dark competition amongst self-serving hypocrites, making their selfish behavior feel even more justified. Unfortunately, _you_ do not know what you are up to, because that knowledge is being very carefully shielded from conscious self-reflection. You will therefore take their recalcitrance as proof that they really _are_ evil, thus licensing even more contempt. You will never notice your own complicity in this dark spiral.

Self-deception cannot drive out self-deception. It can only reinforce it. The deeper down this rabbit hole you go, the harder it gets to notice that you're lost, because the more cleverly your darkness hides it from you. Feeling contempt for people who are stuck in this way is secretly a desire to keep them trapped for your own benefit.

Your enemies are not actually fundamentally inferior to you; they are merely caught in a different version of the same trap that you are. If you do not see this, then every action you take "against" them will secretly be in service _to_ them — or more precisely, in service of the same dark goal that they may or may not realize they are fighting for: a darker world in which limitless contempt is justified; one in which none of us ever has to confront the unprocessed shadows of our own minds.

---

Darkness is an absence masquerading as a presence. The absence of what? Of a particular insight.

The ultimate truth is that you are everyone and everything. It is said that this is only fully revealed upon _enlightenment,_ but all of us can sense it at all times, if only subconsciously. 

---


You have _no idea_ how fiendishly clever our darkness is. It is that "evil global conspiracy" that some people fear exists: a covert entity responsible for all the world's ills, that hides itself so perfectly that nobody even suspects its existence, let alone that _they themselves are in on it_. They cannot even see it when it is clearly and explicitly pointed out. This is what we are all up against.

---

The only way out of this dark trap is _kindness_. It has nothing to do with being _nice._ The conflation of those two words is itself an artifact of our darkness.


---
---

Why are we unkind to people who we perceive as "bad"? The answer seems obvious: we do it to make the world a better place. But this is an insidious lie. It explains why we're not _nice_, but not why we're not _kind_. Nice is about being pleasant and agreeable, which are clearly unhelpful in some situations. But kindness is something much deeper. It is the right motivation in _every_ circumstance.

A healthy mind harbors no hostility under any circumstances. That's not because it is meek or even "tolerant" per se. It can be fierce or even violent in subduing evil. These can be kindness too. But it cannot feel even a _trace_ of malice, contempt, or self-righteousness, because it has seen something clearly.

It has seen that those sentiments are lies: they exist *only* to help us get away with something that we otherwise could not. We want to behave in some way that is self-serving, which we couldn't do if we could see the full humanity of the person we are attacking. So a dark aspect of our mind tricks us into perceiving them as somehow _fundamentally defective_. That way, we won't feel bad harming them. It might not even be obvious what we're getting out of it. For some, it is financial gain or feelings of power, but very often it is (ironically) just to bolster our self-image as "good people," who therefore deserve to get away with more. A deep part of us recognizes our hypocrisy, but we carefully hide it away from conscious self-reflection.

We feel like we are teaching the other person a lesson, but they may not even be (knowingly) doing anything wrong. They may be honestly doing the best they can, in which case we're harming an innocent person. But even if they _are_ knowingly doing wrong, it's only because they're under the sway of _precisely_ the same self-deception that we presently are. Either way, the only "lesson" they learn is that this world is indeed a dark and phony place; that the Light is just a myth. Whatever temporary benefit we may achieve — such as suppressing their (public) misbehavior — this powerfully reinforces their self-deception, making them appear _more_ evil. This in turn proves to _us_ that the world is a nasty place, thus requiring our "righteous" escalation.

You have _no idea_ how good your subconscious is at telegraphing your darkness to others while simultaneously hiding it from yourself. This combination sets up perfect feedback loop, in which you can trigger others while convincing yourself that it's their fault. And this is far from the only way that your darkness leaks out. As long as you are harboring any hardness or hostility in your heart, it _will_ find its way into the world, one way or another, without your conscious knowledge. Except it's not truly unconscious: it is always available to consciousness, if only we choose to look. The problem is that we _choose not to look_.

Here is the choice that confronts each one of us: become aware of having chosen to look away — and thereby discover that this is how _all_ evil works, and that our self-righteous judgement therefore has no basis whatsoever — or continue to delude ourselves, entering deeper and deeper layers of self-deception, darkening the world in increasingly "justified" ways.

Evil is an absence masquerading as a presence. The absence of what? Of a particular insight.

The ultimate truth is that you are everyone and everything. It is said that this is only fully revealed upon _enlightenment,_ but all of us can sense it at all times, if only subconsciously. It is only by overlooking this astonishing truth that anyone is able to harm anyone else. This is self-deception; the origin of all contempt; the root of all evil.

Yet although it is an absence, it behaves very convincingly like a presence. When you look in the eyes of someone in the grip of this deception, you see the _presence_ of evil. This is the moment of truth. If you choose profound honesty, you will be forced to admit that the same potential exists within you, and you will gain at least some insight in how to evict it, commensurate with your willingness; your deep compassion.

Your darkness, on the other hand, convinces you that you could never be like them; that you are _fundamentally_ superior. You perceive them as _intrinsically defective_, thus inspiring contempt. Their darkness instantly recognizes that you have taken the bait, and the game is on. Now, both yours and theirs are secretly _allied_, knowing that they can freely spread darkness in the world, unbeknownst to you, their hosts.

In fact, from a certain perspective, your darkness and theirs aren't truly separate. They behave more like outgrowths of a single, distributed, malevolent entity. If your darkness is the devil on your shoulder, then this entity is the _Devil._ It is that "evil global conspiracy" that some people fear exists: a covert body responsible for all the world's ills, that hides itself so perfectly that nobody even suspects its existence, let alone that it lives _in their own minds_. They cannot even see it when it is clearly and explicitly pointed out. It is the _primordial_ evil conspiracy; the one to which all the rest ultimately filter up, and to which they owe their existence.

It continually drives humanity toward various kinds of Armageddon: situations in which everyone is violently proving how _righteous_ they are. It is why the US is headed toward civil war without anyone suspecting their own complicity, and explains bitter [divorces](https://www.gottman.com/blog/this-one-thing-is-the-biggest-predictor-of-divorce/) in which each side feels like the exclusive victim / hero. Nearly the whole world is caught in its terrible sway, evil provoking "righteous" retribution at every turn, without anyone ever noticing the true source of it all. Every act of unkindness you've ever perpetrated on anyone; all the hardness you carry in your heart; has only ever been in its service.

It is said that the elites are playing us off each other to take attention off of them, but the Devil is playing a _much_ bigger game — one in which even the elites are merely pawns. It tricks you into hating them specifically so that you will empower it — and thereby empower _them_. It is the reason that nothing ever seems to change. It accomplishes this by convincing you that your compassion isn't powerful enough to combat their evil; that your darkness is required. It is the ultimate trap — and we keep falling for it.

---

The Light is not just a myth; it is your most fundamental nature. Whereas your devil is extrinsic, your compassion is _intrinsic._ It is the very root of who and what you are. When you discover this in its entirety, you see it in everyone else, too — because, in a profound and astonishing sense, they _are_ you. It is your most sacred duty as a human to remember this, so that you can share it freely with others (though paradoxically, if you still see them as "other," and yourself as their noble savior, then this isn't quite it yet.)

Your compassion is not weak — indeed, it is the most powerful force there is. It is the _only_ thing that can genuinely combat evil, for precisely the same reason that light is the only thing that can combat darkness: the latter is nothing but the _absence_ of the former. Yet treating it like a presence can be skillful, because then you will not underestimate its terrifying capacity to grip minds and bring the whole world to its knees. This compassion must be paired with _wisdom,_ which is the knowledge of how best to put it into fierce and powerful practice. That takes time to develop, and is beyond the scope of this piece.

Our enemy is never truly other people, but the darkness that has overtaken all of our minds. May we all remember this, and free this world of the illusion that has overtaken it.

But this devil doesn't just whisper obviously-bad ideas in your ear; no, it alters your very perception so that other people's devils appear to be _intrinsic_. You therefore perceive them as subtly &#40;or profoundly&#41; subhuman, so that contempt becomes self-evidently righteous.)

[//]: # (This is the first crucial step in every atrocity ever committed.

But please don't think I am making the silly mistake of claiming that hating Nazis makes you as bad as a Nazi. The point is to see that something in your mind is actively trying to find some way to make you feel _intrinsically superior_ to others — and that this is the "foot in the door" that opens your mind to going down a dark, dark path — one that you will not realize you've gone down until it is too late. You don't _need_ this crutch to fiercely combat Nazis.)

You never actually wanted to be malicious, but a bizarre "hall of mirrors" effect in your mind made the world appear in a way that seemed to require it. The "bad people" were merely trapped in a much more intricate version of the same. Seeing this clearly, how could you ever want to push them deeper in? Your sacred duty is — and always has been — is to help pull others _out_; to elicit their inner Light, instead of fruitlessly wrestling with their darkness, like two pigs in the mud. You see that this is a much more magnificent — and profoundly honest — vision of reality.)

Over time, we lose the ability to give people the benefit of the doubt. We stop seeing real people, and start pattern matching on their words, gestures, and general appearance. These patterns grow to match more and more people, enabling us to feel increasingly righteous even as the infection spreads. Soon even genuinely good faith efforts appear sinister. We think we're seeing their darkness when we're really seeing a reflection of our own.

This is how "the elites" are able to screw regular people without feeling remorse — and it is also how we secretly empower their misbehavior. We think that our contempt exists to fight them, but it is secretly designed to leak our darkness into the world, where it will ripple through minds, eventually finding its way back to theirs. Something in us _knows_ that it is doing this. In fact, it is doing it on purpose, to justify some feeling or behavior that we may not be conscious of yet. 

It would take a _profoundly_ wise person to help you confront this. If they did it gently, you could easily shrug them off. And if they did so with contempt, well, your mind is acutely sensitized to the game they're playing, and will violently return the favor.

This is _extremely hard_ to admit, but it must be done. If you — the "good person" — aren't able to confront your own self-deception, how much the less can you expect it of the "bad people"? 

[//]: # (The deeper down this rabbit hole we go, the less innocence we are able to see in others. More and more people appear "defective," until even their genuinely good faith appears sinister. Our mind is growing increasingly dark to support our "habit," yet we feel increasingly righteous, to cover our tracks.)
[//]: # (This is how our darkness masquerades as the Light. The more we fall for it, the less capable we are of noticing that we are, even when it is pointed out gently and kindly. Eventually people become frustrated and point it out with _contempt_. We know all too well what they're secretly up to — pretending to be helping while actually spreading darkness. Of course, we don't let them get away with it.)
[//]: # (People on opposite extremes of the political spectrum may disagree on the details, but they agree on one crucial thing: that _darkness is the way_. In this way, they are allies.)
[//]: # (This is how political ideologies overtake our humanity.)

This self-deception is caused by a kind of parasite in the mind. Think of it as that devil on our shoulders. It is _extrinsic_ to your mind. But unlike in the cartoons, it doesn't just whisper obviously-bad ideas in your ear; no, it alters your very perception so that other people's devils appear to be _intrinsic_. You therefore perceive them as subtly (or profoundly) subhuman — the first step in every atrocity ever perpetrated. Contempt becomes self-evidently righteous.

You and they may be enemies on the surface, but your devils are always _allied_; theirs triggering yours, which triggers theirs back, etc., resulting in an all-too-familiar descent into Hell. In fact, if you look carefully, you'll see that your devils aren't truly separate: they behave more like limbs of a single distributed malevolent entity — the _Devil_, if you will. It is that "evil global conspiracy" that some people fear exists: a covert entity responsible for all the world's ills, that hides itself so perfectly that nobody even suspects its existence, let alone that _they themselves are actively in on it_. They cannot even see it when it is clearly and explicitly pointed out. This is what we are up against. You have _no idea_ how clever it is.

It continually drives humanity toward various kinds of Armageddon: situations in which everyone is violently proving how _righteous_ they are. It is why the US is headed toward civil war without anyone suspecting their own complicity, and explains bitter [divorces](https://www.gottman.com/blog/this-one-thing-is-the-biggest-predictor-of-divorce/) in which each side feels like the exclusive victim / hero. Nearly the whole world is caught in its terrible sway, evil provoking "righteous" retribution at every turn, without anyone ever noticing the true source of it all. Every act of unkindness you've ever perpetrated on anyone; all the hardness you carry in your heart; has only ever been in its service.

It is said that the elites are playing us off each other to take attention off of them, but the Devil is playing a _much_ bigger game — one in which even the elites are merely pawns. Your hatred may help change the details of _who_ is in power, but not _what_ is in power. The only way to win is to stop playing its sordid game; to give up your "right" to harbor hostility. It isn't accomplishing what you most deeply want.

This has nothing to do with being nice, but _everything_ to do with being kind. Kindness is simply the absence self-deception. It can never be wrong. The more you are free of deception, the more you are able to recognize yourself in other people, no matter how "bad" they may be. You increasingly see the "great battles" that have led them down dark paths, which gives you insight into how to undo it instead of compounding it. Such behavior may look nothing like "kindness" from the outside — it can look fierce and violent; like mockery and shaming; like almost anything at all. But from the inside, you always know, for there is not even a *trace* of genuine malice, contempt, or self-righteousness. If you are still dividing the world into the fundamentally "good" and "bad," it is an unmistakable sign of self-deception operating.

The ultimate truth is that you _are_ everyone and everything. It is said that we only see this upon _enlightenment,_ but all of us can sense it to some degree at all times.

Contempt is intrinsically self-deceptive because it is the pretense that you are _fundamentally superior_ to your target. Then can sense that you're acting from self-deception, and part of them knows that this is what they are doing. They therefore feel that you do not have the moral authority to be judging them, which is why they dig in their heels. You, on the other hand, don't know that you're doing this, and so their recalcitrance just proves your point. It is the perfect trap. Contempt itself is not obviously-evil, especially when it's aimed at "bad people." But it reliably _induces_ evil — and anything that creates more evil can surely be called evil, especially when it pretends not to. So both you and your target walk away feeling increasingly justified.



---
---


When we encounter darkness in the world, we feel morally licensed — obliged, even — to sprinkle in a little of our own. We are just giving them a taste of their own medicine or... something.

We then complain when the world as a whole looks darker later, not connecting the dots to our own behavior. 


---

Why are we unkind to people who we perceive as "bad"? The obvious answer is that we do it to make the world a better place, but this is an insidious lie. It explains why we're not _nice_, but not why we're not _kind_. Nice means pleasant and agreeable, which people sometimes don't deserve. Kind means something much deeper, and it cannot be earned.

When you treat people with contempt, you _strengthen_ their capacity for self-deception. You are displaying a form of darkness yourself, and this triggers their defense mechanisms. They therefore appear even more evil, which convinces you that you were right about them all along. It is a self-fulfilling prophecy whose only purpose is to distance you further from your enemies.

[//]: # (Explain why contempt is a form of darkness. You are pretending to be intrinsically better. Can come later.)

Part of your mind knows perfectly well that you are creating more darkness, but it carefully hides this knowledge from conscious self-reflection. Sound familiar? You are doing to them precisely what you are viciously judging them for. In fact, this is what provokes their defenses in the first place: why would they tolerate contempt from a hypocrite?

It is worth lingering on this to appreciate its fiendish cleverness. Contempt itself doesn't seem obviously evil — but it secretly telegraphs a dark intent, which provokes _their_ darkness, and in this way  creates more evil. And anything that secretly creates evil can surely be called evil. Yet it provides you with the appearance that you are _fighting_ evil — and how could that ever be wrong?

This is how your darkness masquerades as Light; how it convinces you to do its bidding while making you feel utterly righteous. It is a kind of superpower: you are able to spread evil simply by intending it, and in a way that convincingly appears to be fighting it — except to those who have developed "the eyes to see." Our task is to develop these eyes.

Evil is ultimately an absence; the absence of a particular kind of introspective awareness. As such, it cannot be defeated by more absence. As MLK Jr sagely hinted:

> *Darkness cannot drive out darkness; only light can do that. Hate cannot drive out hate; only love can do that.*

But although it is an absence, it very convincingly _appears_ and _behaves_ like a terrifying presence. 

---

We can practically _see_ the evil in other people's eyes. It is what powerfully evokes our own darkness. 

---


If you were to suddenly be exposed to the full extent of your own complicity in the world's darkness, without the proper psychological safeguards, it would violently shatter your worldview. 

You intend to prove how _different_ you are, but it only proves how _similar_ you are. Your mind therefore pushes it even harder out of consciousness. It only takes a few cycles of this before we become incapable of seeing it, even when it's shown to us by wise people with considerable skill and patience. How much the less so when our noses are forcefully rubbed in it by those with "good intentions"; people who are hopelessly trapped themselves?

This is the terrible bind that humanity finds itself in now: everybody is busy trying to violently uproot the evil in others, not realizing the astonishing trick going on deep within their own minds.





[//]: # (You have the choice of treating such people either like they have the capacity for redemption or like they are fundamentally defective. The former is kind, and the latter is evil. Not just because it makes the world darker — which it does — but because it originates from an aspect of mind that is _trying_ to darken it.)




---
---

Humans have a nearly infinite capacity for self-deception. One of the clearest examples is when we pretend that we can make the world as a whole better by being unkind to individual people. The truth is that we are engaging in exactly the same self-deception that's driving their misbehavior in the first place.

"Kind" is not the same as nice. Nice means being pleasant and agreeable, and is obviously the wrong response in many situations. Kind means something much deeper. It is the right response to every situation. We will not get the more beautiful world our hearts desire until we see this clearly.

---

It is said that upon _enlightenment,_ you discover that you are literally everyone and everything. What would it be like to catch a glimpse of this realization?

You would see that evil is nothing but the _absence_ of this realization — and yet, despite it being an absence, it appears and behaves suspiciously like a _presence._

People are only able to cause (intentional) harm by objectifying others; seeing them as fundamentally subhuman or inferior. It is the cause of atrocities, and it is how corrupt politicians and CEOs justify harming others for their own benefit.

---



When we see this mechanism operating in others, we don't recognize a fellow human in the grip of a powerful illusion that we ourselves share; no, we see someone who is _fundamentally morally defective_ and thus completely unlike us.

Take a moment to reflect on what's wrong with the world, and bring to mind the people responsible: the greedy bankers; the hypocritical CEOs; the corrupt politicians (and all who support them), perhaps. Don't they seem _intrinsically bad_; fundamentally unlike you? This is a motivated misperception, designed to enable you to treat them in ways that you otherwise never could. If you could see that they have the capacity for redemption, you would instantly realize that your contempt is profoundly counterproductive.

The truth is that part of you _can_ see it. If you look carefully enough — and this is _hard_ — you'll see that part of you is just choosing to overlook it. This is self-deception, and the surprising part is that your "target" can subconsciously sense it too. It makes them perceive you as a hypocrite — viciously judging them for something that you yourself are doing _right now_ — and it makes them feel _more_ justified in their misbehavior. You, in turn, take this as a sign that they really are as bad as you feared, thus licensing escalation. The world is made darker as a result.

It is worth reflecting on the fiendish cleverness of this trap. Simply by showing contempt, you were telegraphing your own darkness — as though to hint to them what you are really capable of if pushed. This provoked _their_ darkness, strengthening both in the process. In other words, all that is required to create more darkness in the world is to subtly reveal your own capacity to do so — and this in turn requires nothing more than pretending that you are fundamentally better than other people.

One way or another, your inner darkness _always_ finds a way to leak into the world, usually undetected by you. From there, it spreads to the far corners of the globe, affecting events far enough away in space and time that you can plausibly disown any connection to them. The problem is that _part of you always knows._

We can practically _see_ the evil in the eyes of "bad people," and it provokes our own inner darkness. The way this works is _fiendishly_ clever.  It is as though we have discovered

It makes us want to violently attack them — if not physically, then at least emotionally. This urge is secretly designed to darken the world; to keep the illusion of separation alive. The way this works is _fiendishly_ clever.

The deepest part of you knows that you are not intrinsically better than anyone. Although this is not made fully conscious until enlightenment, part of you can always sense it. Therefore, contempt — the pretense that you are fundamentally better than someone — is always delusion. It betrays your own lack of insight — in other words, it makes you appear slightly evil. This allows them to see you as a hypocrite, which their darkness seizes on as an excuse to justify its presence in their minds. You, in turn, take this evidence that they really are as bad as you feared, thus compelling you to escalate.

This dance was secretly orchestrated by the darkness in both of your minds. Theirs triggered yours, knowing fully well that you would return the favor. Even if you are not in direct communication with your target (say, a corrupt politician), your contempt darkens the minds of those around you — "allies," enemies, and bystanders alike. One way or another, the darkness _always_ finds a way to leak out.

This whole process is unconscious — except that's not quite true. The horrifying discovery is that it was always fully accessible to consciousness, if only you _chose to look_. But you chose not to look. And it is precisely this "choosing not to look" that enabled your enemies to do what they did — and what you were violently blaming them for.




---

You would suddenly discover that evil is not intrinsic to any mind; that people are only able to cause intentional harm because they haven't seen the truth yet; that even the most evil person is therefore ultimately redeemable. They are _you_, after all — just having been exposed to a vastly different set of conditions.

You would see that the reason we forsake people (i.e., treat them as irredeemable) is to sow more division in the world. It is why we treat our enemies with contempt. We choose to perceive them as _fundamentally defective_ to remind ourselves how different we are. We mock and shame them knowing fully well that they will just dig in their heels, which proves how bad they are, which justifies more contempt. The way this works is fiendishly clever.

Deep down you know that you are not intrinsically better than anyone. Although this is not seen fully until enlightenment, a part of us can always sense it. Therefore, contempt (for people, not just their beliefs or behaviors) is always delusional. It serves only one purpose: to dehumanize others so that we can treat them in a way that we otherwise could not. But for this to work, we must not be fully aware that we're doing it. It is this self-deception that has enabled all the worst atrocities in history, and it is also responsible for how we treat "bad people."

By feeling contempt, you are telegraphing to them your inner darkness. It is as though you are trying to subdue their evil by displaying a little bit of yours; by hinting at what you are capable of. But this backfires miserably: the darkness in their mind now recognizes yours as an _ally_. Both are after only one thing: _more darkness._ Their darkness tells them: "Look, this supposedly-good person is secretly a nasty hypocrite. We are justified in our behavior after all!" Yours tells you: "See, they really are as evil as we feared. We must escalate our righteous wrath." The darkness thereby becomes more firmly entrenched in both minds.

The darkness in all of our minds is intimately connected. In fact, it behaves more like a single distributed malevolent entity. If our darkness is exemplified by that devil on our shoulders, then this entity is the _Devil_. It is said that "the elites" are playing us off each other to take attention away from themselves, but the Devil is playing a _much bigger game_; one in which even the elites are merely pawns. It convinces you to hate them specifically so that you will feel licensed to behave in dark ways — ways that will ultimately circle back to them and make them feel even more justified in their misbehavior, thus reinforcing the cycle.



You know that "evil global conspiracy" that some people fear exists — the one that's somehow responsible for all the world's ills, yet which hides itself so perfectly that people never even suspect its existence? Well, _this is it_ — the _primordial_ evil conspiracy; the one to which all the rest ultimately owe their existence, and to which they all filter up. The reason we can't pin it down "out there" is because it lives deep within the shadows of all of our own minds. From in there, it knows _exactly_ what buttons to press to prevent us from ever suspecting our own involvement.

If we could see that the "bad people" had the capacity for decency, we would immediately recognize that contempt is not a skillful way to encourage it. 


We tell ourselves that they are _fundamentally morally defective_ so that we can blame them for their reaction to our contempt. Being _nice_ to an "evil person" is clearly not an option, and if we are fierce, then of course they will see us as nasty hypocrites and dig in their heels. But this isn't true: it wasn't your fierceness that provoked this response, it was your _self-deception_; your _contempt_.

We tell ourselves that they're not shielding anything; that because they are _fundamentally morally defective,_ there is no conscience to shield anything _from_. But the "big reveal" is that we only believe this so that we don't have to confront the fact that we are, in fact, empowering their self-deception — that we are thereby _creating more evil_, and therefore have no leg to stand on when we contemptuously judge them for their misbehavior.



---


You would see that even the most evil person is fundamentally redeemable — because they are _you_, after all, just exposed to a vastly different set of causes and conditions. They're only able to cause harm because they haven't seen the truth yet. In fact, this is the only reason that _anybody_ is able to cause (intentional) harm. And this realization lies on a spectrum; it's not black and white. The more deeply you see it, the less willing you are to hurt others (or "the environment") — because you can perceive the astonishing network of causality by which harming "others" ultimately harms yourself.

You would see that hating people for not realizing this makes exactly as much sense as hating the mentally ill or retarded: if they could clearly see the distortion that has gripped their mind, they couldn't possibly want it. In fact, hating "bad people" is _worse_ than hating the mentally ill, because it is secretly designed to push them _deeper into the abyss_; to create more evil. The way this works is fascinating.

The deepest part of you can **always** sense your equality with all beings. Contempt is the pretense that you are _fundamentally better_. It is a manifestation of your own darkness; your own delusion. By displaying (genuine) contempt, you are wearing your darkness on your sleeve. Your target instinctively recognizes it (if only subconsciously), and it triggers their own darkness in turn. It makes them perceive you in exactly the way you perceive the "bad people": as _evil._ They therefore feel morally obligated to fight you.

Of course, their digging in their heels just further convinces you that they really are bad, which licenses you to escalate your righteous wrath. The "net enmity" in the world thus increases. But far from being an unfortunate side effect of your "good intentions," this is secretly _the whole point._ Something within you isn't yet ready to see your commonality with all beings, and it manufactures clever ways to keep that realization at bay. It creates and maintains enemies specifically so that you don't have to wake up.

Why is it not ready for you to wake up? Because if you were too suddenly exposed to the Truth, you would discover that all the contempt you heaped on them was every bit as "evil" as what you were violently blaming them for in the first place. It originated from the same misperception, and it perpetuated the same delusion in the world, in exactly the same way. Your enemies were _knowingly_ darkening the world at some level — but so were you. It is impossible to overstate the agony of being forced to confront this without the necessary psychological safety mechanisms in place.

Yes, (some of) your political enemies may indeed be dangerous hypocrites, voting for harmful policies out of spite while pretending to be righteous. And yes, at a deep level, part of them knows that they're doing this, though they are unable to admit it even to themselves. But if you could really see the full set of conditions that shaped them, you could never feel contempt. You could only feel compassion — if not for them, exactly, then for the human condition as a whole.

To be clear: this doesn't mean that you would be _nice._ Sometimes "tough love" may be necessary, as may be _apparent_ contempt. But if you still perceive other people as somehow _fundamentally morally defective_ (and thus completely unlike you), then you are still firmly in the grip of precisely the delusion that you think you are fighting — and you can only increase it, while being flawlessly convinced that you are helping. To be clear, this is a perception and not just a belief. If you can still feel contempt, malice, or self-righteousness, then it is still operating.



This is the hardest thing to describe. Evil never stays confined to your own mind; it always finds a way to leak out. By engaging in self-deception, you are sending ripples of darkness out into the world, where they will have far-ranging impacts on events distant in time and space. You will be able to convincingly disown any connection to them, but the connection always remains. Part of you can always perceive this, and one day it will be made fully conscious.

(US politics are similarly effective, but long-standing friendships were less likely to have formed across this boundary in the first place amongst Americans.)

There's a popular idea that if we just rounded up all the "evil people" and rid ourselves of them, the world would be better off. The problem with this idea is that it is generated by _precisely_ the same aspect of mind that it pretends to be fighting — and it is secretly designed to reinforce it.

All the darkness in the world is intimately connected, and part of it lives deep within your own mind. Its cleverest trick is to make you externalize it; perceive it as existing only "out there." In particular, it makes you perceive evil as being _intrinsic_ to some minds and not others. The latter deserve your compassion, while the former deserve only contempt. It is a lie.

If you want to destroy evil, you have to defeat this shielding; to expose the very deepest aspect of people's minds to what they're really doing. Yet if you simply rub people's noses in their misbehavior (e.g., by mocking or shaming them), it tends to backfire; they just dig in their heels. What's going on?

What's happening is that the part of you that's trying to rub their noses in it is _precisely_ the self-deceptive mechanism that you're contemptuously judging them for. Part of you _wants_ "bad people" to get worse; to dig in their heels. It wants to shove their minds deeper into the abyss; to _strengthen_ their capacity for self-deception. Why? Because it craves the feeling of self-righteousness — and the deeper in you push them, the more delicious (and justified) it will be when you violently defeat them.

This may sound extreme, but it's exactly why the US is headed toward civil war without anybody recognizing their own complicity. But it's not your fault, either — not exactly, anyway. We're all familiar with the idea that the elites are playing regular people off each other to take attention away from themselves, but the rabbit hole goes _so much deeper._

Self-deception is caused by a kind of parasite in the mind. It makes you feel different and special, whether based on physical characteristics (like skin color) or mental ones (such as being a "good person"). It uses your specialness to make you perceive certain people as _fundamentally defective._ Instead of recognizing "bad people" as being under the sway of a nasty parasite — one that you yourself share — you perceive them to be _fundamentally morally defective_; completely unlike you.

This makes you treat them with contempt — which is an unmistakable signal to their parasite that _you_ are infected. It serves as a kind of "secret handshake," activating both their parasite and those of anyone who witnesses your state — friends, enemies, and bystanders alike. In fact, your parasites are not truly separate. They behave more like outgrowths of a single malevolent distributed entity. If your parasite is the infamous devil on your shoulder, then this "entity" is the _Devil_ — and it "really exists."

That is to say, you can begin to perceive just how intimately connected all the evil in the world actually is — and how intertwined it is with your own mind. So much of you what you blame "out there" is the result of something that originated "in here." But there seems to be a powerful force actively preventing each one of us from confronting our full complicity in the world's ills — and it flows freely between us, beneath our conscious thresholds. This is very hard to describe, but maybe you've tasted it before.

Ultimately, it is this "entity" that is playing all of humanity against itself, to take attention off of _it_ — and we keep falling for it. Yes, there is great darkness in the world, and it must be fought relentlessly. But if you still perceive it as existing only "out there," then you are still acting as its minion — and you will feel _completely confident_ that you are not.

Why do we enjoy mocking and shaming our political enemies? Is it to help them (or others) "see the light" and to make the world a better place? Or is it to revel in our own superiority?

We don't get to see all the downstream effects of our behavior — such as a humiliated father venting his frustration on his children, who then grow up to become "bad people" themselves. And even if by some miracle we do, we easily avoid recognizing our own complicity. Sure, we may have provoked him, but it was _his_ responsibility to handle it with grace. The fact that he didn't is just more evidence that he's _bad_.

The truth is that there is an aspect of your mind that is more than willing to darken the world for its own (supposed) benefit — though it will never let you see the full extent of its misbehavior. Part of your mind knew perfectly well that your target was likely to dig in his heels and become a worse person. In fact, it _intended_ this. But this knowledge was carefully hidden from conscious self-reflection; from that part of you that _knew better_. All you could consciously hear were your own (very clever) justifications.

It is precisely this same self-deceptive mechanism that has enabled _all the evil there ever was_ — and every time you engage in it, you reinforce this tendency in others. Your contempt for "bad people" doesn't actually exist to fight evil; it is secretly designed to create _more_ of it while convincing you that it is righteous. It is not until you realize just how badly you've been fooled that you begin to appreciate what is going on in the minds of the "bad people" — and thereby become able to combat it.

To be clear: mockery and shaming can probably be helpful tools under the right circumstances. But to the degree that you're wielding them with self-righteousness (which is basically always, for most of us), you are subconsciously telegraphing to the world your secret intent to darken it — and others pick up on this, whether they're aware of it or not. It acts as an invitation for them to do the same, whether they're nominally friends or enemies.

This self-deception is caused by a kind of parasite in the mind. It makes you feel different and special, whether based on physical characteristics (like skin color) or mental ones (such as being a "good person"). It uses your specialness to make you perceive certain people as _fundamentally defective._ For example, instead of recognizing "bad people" as being under the sway of a nasty parasite — one that you yourself share — you perceive them to be _fundamentally morally defective_, and thus worthy of harm.

It is that little devil on your shoulder — but unlike in the cartoons, it doesn't identify itself as such. It doesn't whisper obviously-bad ideas in your ear. No, it masquerades as your angel, disguising its sinister plans as _impossibly righteous._

Your devil can recognize when other people are similarly afflicted, and it attracts you to them. It makes you fixate on how _bad_ they are, encouraging you to be nasty in ways that will provoke _their_ devils (and those of anyone else in your orbit). You may be enemies on the surface, but under the cover your devils are secretly allied. In fact, they're not truly separate: they behave more like outgrowths of a single "distributed malevolent entity" that has captured _all_ of our minds — the _Devil_, if you will.

We're all familiar with the idea that the elites are playing regular people off each other to take attention away from themselves, but the rabbit hole goes _so much deeper._ Ultimately, this entity is playing all of humanity against itself, to take attention off of _it_. It is playing a much bigger game than we can fathom — and we keep falling for its same old trap. Yes, there is great darkness in the world, and it must be fought relentlessly. But if we still perceive it as intrinsic to some minds and not others (most notably, not our own), then we are still acting as its minions — and we will feel _completely confident_ that we are not.

To be clear, there _are_ people who are so deeply infected that the label "evil" may indeed serve a useful purpose. Their parasites are _particularly_ clever at convincing you to perceive their evil as intrinsic.

Your true enemy is never actually other people, but this remarkable mind-virus that has infected all of our minds. The entire fight against evil comes down to seeing this clearly.

"Kindness" may be the most misunderstood word in the English language. It doesn't mean being nice, or sweet, or tolerant, or understanding. True kindness can be fierce, or possibly even violent, as the situation warrants. Understanding this requires noticing something about our minds — something that we often avoid looking at.

[//]: # (Have you noticed how quick we are to label others "bad people" and treat them with contempt? It feels like this is a sign of the good within us, but it's actually a sign of something much darker. Yes, there are people acting in profoundly harmful &#40;and frankly, evil&#41; ways out there, but it isn't for the reason we normally think — and our contempt makes it worse, not better. In fact, contempt is secretly _designed_ to make things worse.)

[//]: # (They seem completely unlike us. But this is a powerful illusion, and it's caused by precisely the same mechanism in your mind that's permitting their misbehavior in the first place. )

---

When we misbehave, do we tolerate contemptuous judgement from others? No. Whether they have a valid point or not, such behavior makes us see them as "bad people," which triggers our instinct to put them in _their_ place. But this plays perfectly into their hand, because it validates their perception of us as bad, licensing them to escalate. Part of us knows that this was actually the whole point of their contempt: they were _pretending_ to help the world by being nasty to a "bad person," but they were secretly just baiting us so that they could look good themselves.

Contempt is _always_ a form of self-deception; a way to enrich or otherwise elevate ourselves at the world's expense. When directed at "bad people," it is designed to push them further into the abyss while appearing righteous on the surface. We don't mock our political enemies to help them (or anyone else) "see the light" or make the world a better place; we do it to prove how _bad_ they are, so that we may escalate our righteous wrath. This makes the world darker: it encourages more contempt in our allies and bystanders, and more self-deception in our enemies, too.

This is an extremely difficult thing to admit, because underneath it is a horrifying truth: that we are doing _exactly_ the thing that we're contemptuously judging others for. We are _knowingly_ darkening the world while pretending not to know. This fact is always completely accessible to consciousness, but we actively ignore it. We have no leg to stand on while we are still doing this.

The point is not to compare you with the worst people. There are indeed those whose self-deception has penetrated so deeply that they no longer have any intention to be of service to the world — and this is quite unlike yourself. But until you see clearly the mechanism that is allowing them to thrive in that abyss — and how it lives within you, too — you cannot help the world be rid of it. Indeed, you can only _reinforce_ it while flawlessly convinced that you're helping. And it is only possible to understand that mechanism by seeing clearly how it operates in your own mind.

You will find that the self-deceptive mechanism is caused by a kind of mind-virus. It works by convincing you that you are different and special. If you are not the kind of person that feels special due to your race or gender, then it will leverage your identity as a "good person." It will actively prevent you from seeing that the "bad people" are infected by precisely the same virus, so that you will perceive them as _fundamentally defective_ and thus inferior. You will thus make them _worse_ people while convinced that you were helping, which will reinforce your identity of being one of the noble few. By needing to see yourself as a "good person," you will succeed in creating an endless supply of "bad people." It is completely inevitable. This is what the Buddhists know as the _ego._

You and the target of your contempt may be enemies on the surface, but the truth is that your parasites are secretly allied. Your contempt signals to them that you yourself are infected, and it acts like a kind of "secret handshake" — one that it knows they will accept, because all parasites are fundamentally the same. In fact, they aren't truly separate. They behave more like limbs of a single "distributed malevolent entity" that is continually manipulating _all_ of our minds, driving us toward various kinds of Armageddon; situations in which everyone is violently proving just how righteous they are. It is why the US is headed toward civil war without anyone suspecting their own complicity, and explains bitter [divorces](https://www.gottman.com/blog/this-one-thing-is-the-biggest-predictor-of-divorce/) in which each side feels like the exclusive victim / hero. If our individual parasites are that little devil on our shoulders, then this "distributed entity" is the _Devil._

It is said that the elites are playing regular people off each other to take attention away from themselves, but the Devil is playing a _much bigger game._ It is playing all of humanity against itself — and we keep falling for its same stupid trap. Yes, there is great darkness in the world, and it must be fought relentlessly. But if we still perceive it as _intrinsic_ to some minds and not others (most notably, not our own or our allies'), then we are still doing its bidding — and we will feel completely confident that we are not. This is precisely what it's tricking us into doing by hating the "bad people" seemingly behind the world's ills. By doing so, we never notice our own complicity.

You know how some people believe that there's an evil global conspiracy behind all the world's ills? Well, this is it: the _primordial_ evil conspiracy; the one to which all the rest ultimately owe their existence, and to which they all filter up. It hides itself from conscious awareness, lurking in the shadows of our minds, whispering in our thoughts, communicating with itself beneath our conscious thresholds. It keeps us perpetually fixated on the evil "out there," so that we never discover the astonishing depths of our own complicity. Yes, there is an evil global conspiracy — and we are its minions. 

But there is a way to give up your seat at the table: you must remember your own "inner Light." How will you know when you've found it? Because you will be unable to feel even a trace of malice, contempt, or self-righteousness. It is not that you will stop seeing evil, but you will stop seeing it as _intrinsic_ to anyone. It's not just a change in belief, but a change in your very perception — and it makes all the difference in the world. This is true kindness, and it doesn't mean being nice. Sometimes kindness must be fierce, or possibly even violent. It might look like mocking or shaming. It might even look like a bullet. But whatever form it takes, it will serve the purpose of _evicting_ the parasites from people's minds. I cannot tell you exactly how this works, but I know you have felt it before. Some people are much harder cases than others — but the feeling that anyone is _impossible_ is always our own parasite talking. It just means that we don't have the necessary skill yet (and ought to be extra careful).

All the darkness in the world is intimately connected, and part of it lives deep within your very own mind. Malice, contempt, and self-righteousness are its **unmistakable** signatures. Once you have glimpsed this, you can begin to uproot the core delusion and be of actual service. Your true enemy is not actually other people, but the horrifying parasite that has infected _all_ of our minds. May we remember this and join the fight against it — the only fight that ultimately matters.

Whether they have a valid point or not, such behavior makes it obvious that they don't have the moral authority to be judging anybody. You can practically _see_ the self-deception in their eyes, and it triggers the urge to put them in _their_ place — which they will take as evidence that they were right about you all along. They were baiting you, though they cannot admit it — and neither can you, when you are in their shoes.

When we encounter others in this state, we don't recognize them as being in the grip of a powerful delusion that we ourselves share; no, we perceive them to be _fundamentally morally defective,_ and thus worthy of only contempt. This is itself profound self-deception. The truth is that our contempt is secretly designed to push people further into the abyss; to _reinforce_ their capacity for self-deception. It encourages more contempt in our allies and bystanders, and invites our target to dig in their heels — which serves to convince us that they really are as bad as we feared, thus licensing righteous escalation. We may outwardly lament this outcome, but we secretly intended it.

The truth is that there is _always_ at least a sliver of goodness left in people, even when we — or even _they_ — can't consciously perceive it. Yet the very deepest aspect of your mind always can. Sooner or later you will have to confront this aspect — your conscience — and on that day you will discover that you were intentionally smothering the light in other people just to prove that you were "good" and they were "bad." You were _knowingly_ darkening the world for your own (supposed) benefit. You were doing _exactly_ the thing that you were viciously blaming others for. Ironically, you were doing it to prove just how different you were. It was always bound to fail.

The realization of your hypocrisy will hurt like Hell, but there will be a silver lining. You will see that you never wanted to cause harm; that indeed, you ultimately never _could_. And you will discover, to your great astonishment, that nobody else could, either. You and they only did it because you were badly confused. Your salvation lies not in confirming that you were one of the righteous few battling the hordes of evil, but in discovering your profound equality with all other beings; in deeply humbling yourself. As you discover your own primordial Goodness, you simultaneously discover it in everyone else — _especially_ those who you were convinced never had it.

---

We may scoff at this idea, telling ourselves that they _have_ no such part — or that even if they do, it's too deeply buried to matter — and that they therefore deserve only our contempt. But the truth is that _this is itself profound self-deception._

What may be less obvious is that treating people with contempt is exactly such an example. Contempt isn't actually there to help you fight evil; it only feels that way. It is actually designed to push people further into the abyss; to _reinforce_ their self-deceptive tendencies. You are trying to remind them that they have no "inner light," and by doing so, you are smothering it further. Again, this isn't by accident: a deep part of you knows perfectly well that this is what you are doing, if only you would listen.

We don't recognize that they're caught in the grip of a powerful spell; one that we ourselves are painfully susceptible to. We feel compelled to violently attack them (if only emotionally) — and it feels like this urge comes from our inner goodness. But this is a dark lie.

> _We judge ourselves by our intentions and others by their actions._

Self-deception is caused by an _insanely clever_ parasite in the mind. It makes you overlook the interconnectedness of reality; your deep commonality with other beings. 

Think about how it feels to be treated with contempt. It doesn't matter whether the person is right about your behavior: their contempt is an unmistakable sign that they are under the sway of their parasite. They're pretending to do the world a service but are really just virtue signaling. How in the world do they think that they have the moral authority to be judging you? This is flagrantly obvious from your perspective, but not from theirs. This shouldn't surprise us, because we do exactly the same thing.

We don't hate "bad people" to make the world a better place, _but to make it worse_. Our hatred is secretly a way to telegraph to them (and others) that the very same darkness lives within ourselves. Ostensibly, our "righteous wrath" is a way to strike fear into them; to show them what we're really capable of, so that they think twice. But while this may suppress their misbehavior for a time, what we've really accomplished is convincing their parasite that it _needs_ to exist, to combat ours. It has found exactly the excuse it needs to burrow deeper into their minds. They thus appear _more_ evil to us — evil that we think we have just uncovered, but have actually freshly created.

We tell ourselves that this isn't our fault: that we were only doing our best to "fight evil," and if this made them dig in their heels, it is just more evidence of their fundamental defectiveness. _But this is the deepest of lies._ If you look carefully enough into your mind in that moment — and this is the hardest part — you will see that something within you actually orchestrated this whole dance. And the thing that makes it hard for you to see this is _precisely_ the thing that makes it impossible for the "bad people" to confront their misbehavior in the first place. 

Your parasite's job is to make you feel special. 

It is impossible to free others of their darkness until this becomes painfully clear. Until then, we are only capable of spreading darkness while flawlessly convinced that we are helping.

Our parasites are continually driving us toward various kinds of Armageddon; situations in which everyone is violently proving just how righteous they are. It is why the US is headed toward civil war without anyone suspecting their own complicity, and explains bitter [divorces](https://www.gottman.com/blog/this-one-thing-is-the-biggest-predictor-of-divorce/) in which each side feels like the exclusive victim / hero. It is said that "the elites" are playing us off each other to take attention away from their devious activities, but the parasite is playing a _much_ bigger game: one that pits _all of humanity_ against itself — and we are continually falling for its sinister trap.

You know the "evil global conspiracy" that some people fear exists? This is what they are subconsciously sensing — the _primordial_ evil conspiracy; the one to which all the rest owe their existence, and to which they all ultimately report. Our parasites together behave like a "distributed malevolent entity," continually communicating with itself beneath our conscious thresholds. If the parasite is that devil on our shoulders, then this entity is the _Devil_. It hides itself perfectly in the shadows of our minds, whispering in our thoughts. It keeps us fixated on the evil "out there," where we can't help but violently attack it — not realizing that we are secretly doing its evil bidding. Except that part of us _does_ realize. We just pretend not to — again, _exactly_ the thing we contemptuously judge others for.

Yes, there are people out there _knowingly_ doing wrong; conspiring to bring great harm. But the "big reveal" is that we are secretly _feeding_ them through our very contempt. They are acting as reservoirs for the Darkness; magnets to which we feel irresistibly drawn. They are uniquely powerful at provoking our own inner darkness in a way that flawlessly convinces us that we're helping. It is the ultimate trap. Yes, they must be defeated — but doing so requires _much_ more precision and self-awareness than we have brought to bear so far.

This is why wise people urge compassion for evildoers. They're not telling us to be nice. They are warning us about this very trap. Compassion (aka kindness) can actually be fierce or even violent. It can _look_ like mocking or shaming. But to the degree that you're connected to your own "inner light" — i.e., not under the sway of your own darkness — you cannot feel even a _trace_ of malice, contempt, or self-righteousness. You do not perceive a _fundamentally defective person_. This makes all the difference in the world. I can't tell you exactly how this works, but you've felt it before. Their parasite comes face-to-face with what it fears most: that-which-is-incorruptible; genuine goodness. It is robbed of its excuse to burrow deeper into the mind of its host, and is thereby weakened.

Again, the outward behavior may look absolutely nothing like "kindness" in its conventional sense. It may even look like a bullet. But on the inside, you always know.


[//]: # (Contempt, malice, self-righteousness, etc. exist only to elevate yourself at the world's expense. This is the very thing you hate in others, but in the moment, you don't recognize this.)

[//]: # (Allies and bystanders alike.)

[//]: # (All the darkness in the world is intimately connected, and part of it lives deep within your own mind. But it hides itself with such astonishing cleverness that you never suspect it.)

What we don't realize is that hating such people only _deepens_ their capacity for self-deception; it makes them _worse_ people.

When we hate "bad people," we're ostensibly trying to force them to confront their misbehavior, but that's not what's actually happening. If you look carefully, you'll discover that hatred, malice, contempt, etc. are secretly designed to trigger their defense mechanisms; to make it _harder_ for them to confront their conscience. Their apparent recalcitrance "proves" that they really are as bad as we thought, which then "forces" us to escalate our righteous wrath.

Why do we do this? For those of us who fancy ourselves "good people," our subconscious works hard to maintain this pristine self-image. In addition to hiding our own self-deception from us, it ensures that we overlook any sliver of good left in the "bad people." We don't recognize others as being in the grip of a powerful self-deception that we ourselves share; no, we see people who are _fundamentally defective,_ and thus completely unlike us. This licenses us to shove them further into the abyss while calling it "righteous."

The grand irony is that this behavior is _itself_ the very deception that we're bitterly accusing others of. We are creating more evil in the name of good, while being profoundly unaware that we are doing so. This is itself the most clever and well-disguised form of evil. Our subconscious knows that we're doing this — indeed, it is doing it _on purpose_ — but it is exceedingly difficult to admit this to ourselves.

Yet admitting it is precisely what we must do in order to become of actual service. **It is not until we expose this deepest of deceptions — of being one of the noble few, battling the hordes of evil "out there" — that we fully comprehend the horrifying mechanism that enables the "bad people" to do what they do in the first place.** Until then, we are only capable of _amplifying_ evil while flawlessly convinced that we're fighting it.

What we eventually discover is that there is a kind of mind-virus that has overtaken all of humanity. It alters our very perception, so that we see others as fundamentally different from ourselves, and therefore okay (or even _righteous_) to harm. For the Nazis, it was the Jews; for the Hutus, the Tutsis; and for "good people," it is the "bad" — _whoever they are to you_. This parallel may sound offensive until you recognize what it is pointing to.

To be clear: treating everyone identically, and always being nice and understanding, would surely be naive. There indeed people for whom the infection has penetrated so deeply that they have no conscious awareness of any goodness within; no conscious intention to be of any help. In this case, the label "evil" may actually be of some use. But also notice that we have a strong tendency to call people "evil" even when they're far from it. This is the virus at work.

In either case, perceiving them as _fundamentally_ different is **always** a trap. It is never inspired by the goodness within you, but only ever by your own parasite. The goodness within you can always perceive the light in others (no matter how buried), and wants nothing more than to rekindle it; to _free_ them of their parasite — even if this requires being fierce, or possibly even violent. Your parasite — your darkness — only wants to further smother their light; to _reinforce_ their parasite, while convincing you that this is good and necessary. Everything comes down to telling these urges apart, which is far trickier than it seems. Sometimes, true kindness looks nothing like "kindness" on the outside — but deep within, you always know.

We're all familiar with the idea that the elites are playing regular people off each other to take attention away from themselves, but the rabbit hole goes _so much deeper._ Ultimately, the parasite is playing all of humanity against itself, to take attention off of it — and we keep falling for it, with gusto. It continually goads us into various forms of Armageddon; situations in which everyone is violently proving just how righteous they are. It is why the US is headed toward civil war without anyone suspecting their own complicity, and explains bitter [divorces](https://www.gottman.com/blog/this-one-thing-is-the-biggest-predictor-of-divorce/) in which each side feels like the exclusive victim / hero.

Yes, there is great darkness in the world, and it must be fought relentlessly. But if we still perceive it as having infected some people and not others (most conspicuously, not ourselves), we are still acting as its minions while convinced that we're nobly fighting it — and we will secretly invite others to "nobly" fight us in turn. There is just no way around this. That is its core trick.

All the darkness in the world is intimately connected, and part of it lives deep within your very own mind. Malice, contempt, and self-righteousness are its unmistakable signatures. It is only once you have glimpsed this that you can begin to uproot the delusion and be of actual service.

Your true enemy is not actually other people, but the horrifying parasite that has infected _all_ of us. May we all remember this before it is too late.

When wise people urge compassion for evildoers, they're not just being naive. They're not suggesting we be nice, or sweet, or forgiving, or even understanding. No; they see something that we don't. Namely, that our urge to be cruel to "bad people" comes from _exactly_ the same place that enables such people to be "bad" in the first place — and it accomplishes just as much good.

When you're nasty to a "bad person," part of you is secretly trying to make them _worse._ Or rather, it's trying to provoke a reaction that will prove to you that they're just as bad as you think they are. And the horror is, it works. Why? Because your nastiness is a clear giveaway that you're not someone with the moral authority to be scornfully judging anyone. They see in your eyes precisely the same failure that they're guilty of, and they're not going to let you get away with pretending that _yours_ is somehow noble.

From your perspective, this apparent recalcitrance proves that they really are beyond help, and licenses escalation. After all, any _decent_ person would have simply repented in the face of such righteous wrath. But this is exactly the lie: it is certainly possible to be fierce in a way that combats evil and forces introspection, but that's not what you were trying to do. You were trying to display contempt — not just for their behavior or beliefs, but for _them_. It is a look that says "you are fundamentally irredeemable — and I'm going to make sure you _know_ it."

You may be convinced that this person is literally incapable of any good, but you don't _know_ that. If there is even the tiniest sliver of "light" left in them; any possibility of redemption; your contempt is carefully designed to extinguish it. It is an act of profound violence, and it doesn't come from your inner goodness. While you're in its sinister grip, you don't consciously recognize this. You _think_ you're doing something good, but your eyes tell a different story — one that your "target" easily picks up on.

Your subconscious isn't actually trying to help the world in that moment; it's merely trying to prove you right. It's trying to reassure you that all the evil in the world exists only "out there," and that it is your righteous duty to violently smash it. It does this to distract you from the darkness "in here." But ironically, it is that very darkness "in here" that is acting through you at that very moment, enacting a very clever plot to create _more_ darkness in the world under the guise of good. Doing so will reinforce your worldview that you are one of the righteous few, battling the hordes of evil out there.



---


All the darkness in the world is intimately connected, and part of it lives firmly within your very own mind. It hides itself from your consciousness in _insanely_ clever ways. It constantly redirects your attention away from your own darkness, so that you're continually obsessed with the evil "out there." Whenever it can plausibly claim to have found some, it concocts a clever plot to make you _reinforce_ it under the guise of good, so that you never suspect what you're actually doing.

When we mock our political opponents and they just double down on their idiocy, we may act dismayed, but part of us secretly _wanted_ it. That's because the more obviously-evil they become, the more justified we will be when we are one day forced to "take the kid gloves off" and _really_ show them our teeth. Nothing feels quite as good as violently dismantling Evil. We will never notice all the tiny things we cumulatively did to push them into a position where such violence would become necessary. If someone gently points this out to us, we will just scoff and write them off as stupid or naive. Can't they see that we were "fighting evil"? What were _they_ doing?

If someone points it out _contemptuously_, we will perceive them as evil themselves. Think about how you feel when someone stands in contemptuous judgement of you. Whether they have a valid point or not, you can sense that they don't have your best interest at heart. In fact, they don't have _anyone's_ best interest at heart — except, perhaps, their own. They are doing to you exactly the thing I'm warning about above. They _want_ to get a rise out of you, because your recalcitrance will prove to them that they have indeed located one of the secret hiding places of evil, and thus are licensed to extinguish it by any means necessary. This is "evil," and it triggers your natural instinct to fight back.

What you can't see in that moment is that the Darkness is playing a horrific game through both of you. We're all familiar with the idea that the elites are playing regular people off each other to take attention away from themselves, but the rabbit hole goes _so much deeper._ There is a kind of parasite that has infected **all** of our minds, and it is playing all of humanity off itself to create a world of pure darkness. It presently seems to be winning that fight, in a positive feedback loop: the more we mindlessly play its game of "see evil, smash evil," the more evil we create.

Your true enemy isn't actually other people, but this astonishing virus that has captured all of our minds. The real fight against evil only begins once you see clearly how it operates.

The way it works is astonishingly simple. Think about what's "wrong with the world," and bring to mind the people responsible. Notice the feelings of malice, contempt, or self-righteousness that arise. Notice how it feels convincingly like this is your inner goodness responding. It's not. It is your darkness masquerading as your goodness. If you listen to it, you _will_ behave in some way that creates more darkness in the world, even as you are flawlessly convinced that you're helping. It is precisely this same illusion that has given rise to every atrocity that humans have ever perpetuated, even if the outer details differ considerably.

Those sentiments — malice, contempt, and self-righteousness — exist for _only_ one purpose: to blind you to what your subconscious is secretly doing. In fact, such blindness is the only way that anyone is ever able to (knowingly) cause harm. Part of them knows _perfectly well_ that they're doing wrong, but this knowledge is very carefully shielded from conscious self-reflection. Think about the political opponent example. Part of you knows that your cruelty will just create more enmity in the world, but you somehow can't get yourself to admit it in the moment. Something almost identical is happening in the minds of "evil people" to permit them to do what they do. They know _perfectly well,_ but that knowledge is cleverly hidden from the part of them that would put an end to it.

When you fight them or try to force them to confront their misbehavior _with contempt_, you're not actually trying to help. You are simply under the sway of the same illusion that they are. _Your_ darkness is secretly helping theirs hide itself from the tiny part of them that knows better; a part that they've (consciously) forgotten even exists. If you actually want to help, the "trick" is to _see_ that they are under the command of this mind-virus and don't ultimately want to be doing its bidding (the key word being _ultimately_). It's not enough to simply _believe_ this, or else you may end up just being _nice_ (which can be dangerous). You must actually gain direct insight into how the virus has ensnared their mind. This is the only way to evict it instead of empowering it. This is true kindness, and it is **not** about being nice.

Entire volumes could be written on how to gain such complete insight, and we don't have room for that here. But it all begins by realizing that all the evil that you hate "out there" exists in latent form "in here" — and that you are only capable of fighting it to the degree that you're not falling into its oldest trick yourself. A good litmus test is to ask yourself how easily you fall into malice, contempt, or self-righteousness when confronted with evil or injustice. Equivalently, check whether you see evil as _intrinsic_ to your enemies' minds. These are all unmistakable signs that the darkness is secretly operating in you, undetected. Until you see this clearly, you cannot help but unwittingly spread it.

Make no mistake: it is _extremely painful_ to discover that you yourself have been spreading evil — and that part of you always knew it perfectly well, even as you were doing it. This discovery knocks the sanctimonious wind right out of you, as you're brought to your knees with the horrifying realization that you're every bit as fallible as the people you've been contemptuously judging. Alas, this realization often only lasts a short while until you get right back on your high horse. This is something I know all too well.

Kindness and compassion (which we'll use interchangeably) may be the most misunderstood words in the English language. They don't mean being nice, or sweet, or tolerant, or understanding. The reason we _believe_ they mean these things is that part of our mind is trying to wriggle out of being kind even when deep down we know it's the right thing to do — and it is _always_ the right thing to do.

You see, there is an aspect within every one of us that is willing to harm the world for our own benefit. This is an extremely painful thing to admit — especially if we fancy ourselves "good people" — and so we avoid confronting it. 

[//]: # (This is what gives rise to the psychological tendency known as the _fundamental attribution error_ — briefly, that we judge ourselves by our intentions but others by their actions.)

We don't mock our political opponents to help them (or anyone else) "see the light," or to make the world a better place (like our conscious minds tell us). We do it to further distance ourselves from them; to remind ourselves of how much "better" we are. Part of us knows perfectly well that this will make them worse people — and not only are we okay with this; we're secretly trying to _create_ that outcome.

[//]: # (Our subconscious keeps this a secret even from ourselves — which is why you may not believe me when I tell you.)



What you can't see in that blinded state is that minds are infinitely flexible — including the ones you've written off. Deep down — perhaps beneath their conscious thresholds — they know this about themselves, too. They can feel you attempting to erase this knowledge; to convince them that they're irredeemable. This makes you appear _evil_ to them, which triggers their natural reflex to _fight evil_. This somehow doesn't alert you to the possibility that you might be doing something wrong, like it should. On the contrary, it serves as conclusive proof that _they_ are evil, licensing you to escalate. This is how your subconscious creates new evil in the world while enabling you to feel righteous about it.

All evil is ultimately enabled by a similar smokescreen. There is a mechanism in our minds that hides our misbehavior from ourselves. It's surely true that some people's misbehavior is much worse than our own, but the basic pattern is the same. Part of their mind is carefully hiding the knowledge of the _wrongness_ of their actions from conscious self-reflection. It is a self-deception that we all share. You have a sacred responsibility to help them undo it. And it begins with seeing that self-righteous judgement isn't actually an attempt to do that, even though it very convincingly feels that way.

Notice how it feels like some people know _perfectly well_ what they're doing and choose to do it anyway; thus they really _are_ irredeemable, and deserve only contempt. Here's the problem: you can know something _perfectly well_ and simultaneously hide it from consciousness. For example, you know "perfectly well" that mocking your political opponents makes the world a worse place, but you still can't get yourself to admit it when it counts. Until you see how brilliantly your own subconscious hides your own misbehavior from you, you will never understand the fiendish mechanism that enables "bad people" to do what they do — and thus never discover the secret key that undoes it.

What is this "secret key"? The fact that all minds are redeemable isn't just a belief; it is something that you can learn to perceive directly. In fact, part of you already perceives it. There is an astonishing sense in which you are everyone and everything, and deep down you've always known it. I know this sounds like a vague and woo-woo mystical fantasy, but it really is true. It is why acts of great kindness inspire you so powerfully, even when you gain no obvious personal benefit from them. Whatever benefits the Whole benefits you, because _you are the Whole_. You long most deeply to remember this.

The more thoroughly you remember this, the more you realize that forsaking anyone else is forsaking yourself. Some part of you doesn't yet feel worthy of remembering the full truth, and so it finds secret ways to intensify conflict in your world, and then blames it on the world, to keep the truth hidden. **This is in no way your fault.** More self-blame will not help. Only healing the inner conflict will. This is a gift that you can then offer others.

Kindness is any behavior that induces this remembrance in "others" — or really, in the Whole. It isn't always gentle or nice. Sometimes compassion must be fierce, or perhaps even violent. It may even require what appears to be mockery or shaming on the surface. But _under_ the surface, part of you always knows the difference — and your "target" does, too. They may still consciously perceive you as an enemy, but part of them slowly begins to remember what is really happening.

All the darkness in the world is connected, and part of it lives within your very own mind. Every time you feel the urge to externalize it, you're being given an opportunity to heal the part of it that you (and only you) have complete responsibility for. Don't turn away from that opportunity. It is the "secret key" that unlocks your potential to be of genuine service to the Whole. The worst possible place you can end up is fully externalizing evil, so that it exists only "out there" in loci that you perceive yourself to be valiantly defeating. This is the ultimate self-deception, masquerading as powerful "spiritual truth."

How would you behave if you knew that you are everyone, and everyone is you? All the victims, all the perpetrators — everyone. How would you treat "others" upon realizing this? In particular, how would you treat the _difficult_ people, the _bad_ people, the _evil_ people?

You would recognize the part of yourself that lives within them, and vice versa. You could not possibly feel any contempt, or malice, or animosity. Don't get me wrong: you would still oppose them — possibly fiercely or even violently — but you would be free of the illusion that your contemptuous judgement or self-righteous outrage was in any way benefiting the world.

You would see clearly that these sentiments exist **only** to push people _further_ from the truth; _away_ from recognition of our (surprising) commonality. **We hate "bad people" not to help them (or anyone else) see the Light, but to shove them further into the abyss**. We do this to make them _worse_ people, so that we can feel better by comparison; to continue pretending that we're fundamentally separate and superior. But there's one small problem.

This makes the world worse for our own (supposed) benefit, and part of us knows it. To avoid consciously confronting this horrifying fact, we hide it from ourselves, convincing ourselves that we are just "fighting evil." But now we're in an even bigger mess: not only are we darkening the world, we are lying to ourselves about it. Far from helping us distance ourselves from the "bad people," this subconsciously reminds us of our deep similarity — which we are now forced to hide even harder, resulting in a horrifying feedback loop from which it is _extremely_ difficult to escape.

This is the trap that (nearly) the whole world is caught in. We are all so busy hating the "bad people" out there that we don't realize what is going on in here; what we ourselves are contributing to the madness. In fact, that is _why_ we are doing it: to avoid confronting the darkness within.

Contempt **always** makes the world darker. This is a difficult thing to admit, but necessary. The mechanism that allows us to hide this truth from ourselves is _precisely_ the same one that allows the "bad people" to do what _they_ do without remorse. And the more we engage in this self-deception, the more we encourage them to do the same. It is inevitable. This is **exactly** the wrong thing to do if you want to see a more beautiful world, which you — _we_ — ultimately do.

Your enemy is not truly other people, but the darkness that has ensnared all of our minds. I don't mean this in an abstract sense. You can actually learn to perceive this "dark entity," communicating with itself beneath our conscious thresholds. The "evil" in other people's minds is reaching out to the latent evil within yours, encouraging you to mindlessly obey it in the name of "good." It is a kind of secret handshake, which we often unconsciously accept. It is the oldest trick in the book, and it somehow continues to fool us to this day.

People sometimes fear that there is an "evil conspiracy" behind all the world's ills, secretly pulling the strings. They are not crazy: they are sensing something authentic, and this is it. There _is_ a kind of evil conspiracy, and every last one of us is in on it. Every act of unkindness toward _anybody_ empowers it — and a deep part of us knows this. Being _kind_ doesn't mean being _nice._ It just means being awake to this trap.

Until we have seen the brilliant ruse by which the darkness seduces our own minds, it is impossible to understand what is going on in the minds of the "bad people" — and thus to do anything genuinely useful about it. That is why everything comes down to deeply knowing yourself. If there is any self-righteousness or contempt left, it is an unmistakable sign that your mind is still hiding something _big_ from you. Please find out what it is.

Your Light is capable of accomplishing everything you think you need your darkness for — and so much more. The world does not need more of our contempt. It needs our fierce, uncompromising Love — whatever form it must take. Let's help each other — _ourselves_ — remember this.

What if it were really true that you are literally everyone? All the victims, all the perpetrators — everyone. What would it be like to come back from discovering that?

The more deeply you saw it, the less able you would be to hate anyone. You would see that even the _worst_ person is only suffering from a kind of amnesia — and that hating them can only ever _deepen_ it. In fact, hatred is itself a manifestation of that very same amnesia.

Hating the "bad people" feels unmistakably righteous, but this is exactly the illusion that must be penetrated to understand how they are able to do what they do in the first place. They are under a kind of spell that makes their misbehavior feel okay — and our hatred is designed to make us behave in a way that makes them feel _more_ justified.

In other words, our malice does not _accidentally_ make the world a darker place; it is explicitly _designed_ to do that. There is a kind of parasite that lives in our minds, tricking us into pushing each other further into the dark while convincing us that it's _good_. When we cannot see the light in others, we feel impossibly _righteous_ for hating them — when in actuality this is the surest sign of our parasite controlling us.

We really don't want to be doing this — and the more you remember that you don't, the more your very way of being begins to remind "others" that they don't, either.

What if I told you that all the darkness in the world is connected — and that part of it lives deep within your own mind?

This might be the hardest thing for humans to accept, but it's the truth. There is unkindness deep within each of us that we hide from consciousness, and by letting it fester, we increase the chances of heartbreaking events occurring _somewhere_ on the planet — events that we then wring our hands at, not recognizing our own profound connection to them.

We don't recognize our own darkness because it always feels perfectly justified — or even _righteous_. The mechanism that is hiding yours from you is **exactly** the same one that prevents the "bad people" from consciously confronting the wrongness of _their_ behaviors. This mechanism exists within all of us, and it actively shields us from the full implications of our words and actions.

That's why it may not be obvious that being cruel to "bad people" — whoever you think they are — is itself a form of evil. This isn't a moral judgement, but something that you can learn to directly perceive. Such behavior increases the "net darkness" in the world. I can't tell you how it's possible to perceive such a thing, but it is.

It doesn't even require overt cruelty: simply by harboring contempt, malice, etc., you are lowering the bar for darkness to manifest itself somewhere. And the most horrifying discovery is that this isn't an accident. We don't hate bad people to make the world better, like our conscious minds tell us: we do it to distance ourselves from them by pushing them _further_ into the dark. This creates new evil, and a deep part of us knows this. We can't admit it to ourselves for exactly the same reason that they can't face what they are doing.

When we hide this fact from ourselves — by pretending that our animosity is _righteous_ — we are subconsciously inviting those around us to do the same. Whether they are "allies" or "enemies," their minds are made darker as a result. 
This causes a ripple effect out into the world, eventually causing horrors to materialize _somewhere_; often in a location distant enough in space and time that you will never consciously register their existence, let alone your connection to them. In fact, they are likely to induce _more_ outrage in you, causing you to pile on even *more* animosity. This is the vicious cycle that we see unfolding across the planet today.

When this is all made conscious, confronting evil feels entirely different. You see that our true enemy isn't actually other people, but the darkness that has ensnared all of our minds. You then behave in ways that help others become conscious of their shadows — whether that requires being _nice_ or _fierce_ (or possibly even violent). Either way, it is true kindness. It is completely absent of contempt, malice, and self-righteousness — and this makes all the difference.

It is not something you can fake or calculate your way to. If you are trying to *force* others to see it, there is almost certainly an element of contempt (and thus your own shadow) still operating. Nor is it binary. Rather, the more you clean up your own darkness, the more your very way of being begins to expose others to theirs.

This is the only path toward the "more beautiful world" your heart most deeply longs for — and it all begins with you.

[//]: # (Part of your mind enters that shadowy space that Carl Jung called the collective unconscious, and injects its own unique signature of darkness.)
[//]: # (If you'd like to think of it in less mystical terms, those sentiments subconsciously telegraph a secret intention to do something dark while pretending that it's okay — and inviting others to do the same. )

There's something inside us that loves to obsess over the faults of others — in particular, how _bad_ they are, and how if only they'd change, the world would be so much better. But one "big reveal" that both psychedelics and meditation offer is that this obsession is _always_ a cover for something going on inside of _us_, even though it so convincingly seems to be about others.

It's not that we're entirely _wrong_ about them, per se (though often we are). It's that the _contempt_ and _malice_ we feel are always in proportion to how much "inner work" we still have left to do. As we heal the darkness within, something astonishing happens: we increasingly discover that the "bad" we see in others is invisible to them in exactly the same way that ours was to us — and that our contempt existed only to make it _harder_ for them to notice and heal it.

The truth is that we are all hypocrites — especially those of us who are sure we're not. Part of what this means is that our minds hide certain unpleasant things about ourselves from ourselves. One of the most effective ways to do this is to keep our attention fixated outwards, on the flaws of others — and then to treat them in ways that _appear_ to be helpful, but are secretly designed to push them further into the abyss, so that we look better by comparison.

As this tendency subsides, 

The reason that _kindness_ is such a hard concept to define is that it's simply the _absence_ of this kind of self-deception.

By adulthood, most of us have realized that "hurt people hurt people" — and thus that kindness is sometimes the right approach when dealing with bad behavior. Such kindness doesn't have to be sweet and gentle — it can be fierce (or perhaps even violent) while still being firmly rooted in a fundamentally benevolent intent. It may be "tough love," but it is still love — not necessarily directed at the person specifically, but at the world as a whole, of which they are a part.

On the other hand, sometimes misbehavior seemingly cannot be explained by any kind of pain or "great battle." The person seems _fundamentally bad_. In such cases, compassion evaporates and is replaced by contempt or malice. We may still tell ourselves that it's for the "greater good," but the heartfelt benevolence is gone. Something much darker has taken its place.

It is easy to convince ourselves that these two are the same; that "tough love" and malicious harm can both be for the greater good.

A secret part of you knows perfectly well that treating _anyone_ with contempt just pushes them further into the dark — and it _enjoys doing so_. But given your self-image as a "good person," it can't do this to just anybody. That would reveal its presence to you. So it keeps a lookout for people who it can convince you _have_ no "inner light," so that contempt becomes the only option.

It is exactly the same mechanism that is responsible for their misbehavior in the first place. The details may differ, but its function is essentially the same: to make some (or even all) people appear deserving of contempt, so that certain self-serving tendencies may manifest.

Please know that I am not accusing you of anything. In fact, it is only by becoming aware of and then _deeply forgiving_ this part of yourself that you will understand _why_ it is misbehaving — at which point it will not only stop, but it will help you perceive the "great battles" in others that you previously could not see. Situations will shift from the "contempt" category into the "tough love" category, and your arsenal of tough love will grow.

There's a mechanism within our minds that actively blinds us to the far-ranging implications of our words and behaviors.

Consider a power- and money-hungry politician. He may start a war, which he will justify with noble-sounding motives. Whatever good comes of the war (if any), it will create a lot of needless suffering in the service of enriching him.

Does he _know_ this? Yes and no. Part of him knows _perfectly well_, but his mind is able to shield that knowledge behind an impenetrable wall of justifications. This is self-deception. We all know what this is like. Maybe not on that scale, but we have all overridden our conscience before. Part of us _definitely knows_ — but it's very hard to get us to look that knowledge in the eye.

When we watch a slimy politician in this state, we tend to feel contempt. And that contempt feels righteous; like it's there to help us fight his evil. But something much more interesting and insidious is actually going on.

Part of you knows that you have a tremendous capacity for self-deception. You subconsciously see something of yourself in his eyes. So your mind does something very clever: it treats him with cruelty.

When you are in a state of self-deception, and someone tries to point it out in a nasty way, what happens? You see them as a bad person — because you subconsciously know that they can only do this from a place of self-deception. It inspires you to be nasty in return. It justifies and reinforces your self-deception.

When we see that slimy politician, we tend to feel contempt. And that contempt feels righteous; like it's there to help us fight his evil. But something much more interesting and insidious is actually going on.

Your mind knows that by treating him with contempt, he will see _you_ as someone worthy of contempt, which will convince him that what he is doing is righteous after all. And that recalcitrance will in turn convince you that what you are doing is righteous. Hopefully you see where this is going.

Something within us enjoys fighting with the "bad people" and generally watching them be harmed or humiliated. Pause and see if that's true. We think this is a sign of the good within us, but it's actually a sign of something much darker.

We know that this behavior will make them worse. We may tell ourselves that it won't, or that it's their fault if it does, or that the benefits outweigh the drawbacks, but deep down we know that these are just lame excuses for malicious behavior. And it isn't just a side effect of otherwise-noble behavior: something in us _wants_ them to get worse, because the worse they get, the more vindicated we feel, and the more licensed we are to escalate our righteous wrath.

This idea may be threatening or offensive to our egos, but if we introspect deeply enough, we will find some truth in it.

We behave this way to reinforce our self-image as "good people," but there's a slight problem: deep down, we know that genuinely good people don't shove others further into the dark while calling it righteous. So not only are we acting from self-deception, but this knowledge forces us to suppress our awareness of it even harder, resulting in more powerful self-deception. We quickly become completely unable to consciously acknowledge that this is what we're really doing.

But this isn't something to feel guilty about. That just drives it further out of consciousness. It's actually caused by a kind of mind-virus; one that we all harbor. It's what the Buddhists know as the ego, and it's also commonly depicted as a devil on your shoulder. But what that image gets wrong is that the devil is actually extrinsic to your mind, while the angel represents your deepest nature.

Your devil's job is to make certain people appear _fundamentally defective_ and therefore subhuman, so that harming them becomes not just okay, but positively righteous. This is the trick that enables genocides, but it is operating in every one of us. (Ironically, the people most likely to slide down the path toward atrocities are those who are most convinced that they couldn't — for their devil has already bypassed their mind's most important safety checks. These are also the people who display the most contempt for "bad people.")

Your devil knows that "bad people" are only able to misbehave because they're under the sway of _their_ devil, but it hides this fact from you. It makes you perceive their evil as _intrinsic_, so that you'll viciously attack the person instead of their parasite. It knows that this will just drive the person further into its dark clutches, and it _wants_ this. Although you and they may be enemies on the surface, your devils are secretly _allied._

(It is worth pausing to appreciate how clever this is. When you enter the space of self-deception — which happens whenever you feel contempt — others can subconsciously sense this. This makes them perceive _you_ as "bad" for precisely the same reason that you see _them_ that way. They then feel compelled to attack you and/or justified in mistreating you. So all that is required to create evil is to _feel contempt_ — and it is easy to convince yourself that you haven't done anything wrong.)

Any time you hate someone, your devils are exchanging a kind of "secret handshake." In fact, they're not really separate. If you look carefully, you'll see that they behave more like outgrowths of a single distributed malevolent entity; the _Devil_, if you will. This sinister entity continually communicates with itself beneath our conscious thresholds, tricking us into empowering it while flawlessly convinced that we're fighting it.

It is the primordial "evil conspiracy"; the one to which all the rest ultimately filter up. Every time we feel malice, contempt, or even self-righteousness toward _anyone_ for _any reason_, we are secretly feeding the Beast. Every act of unkindness ripples through its terrible body, lowering the threshold for more acts of evil to erupt in distant locations — for which we will feel absolutely no complicity. But part of us always knows.

It is the perfect trap: a network of evil to which everyone contributes but for which nobody accepts responsibility. It is why the US is headed toward civil war while nobody recognizes their own part. It's not that we're all equally complicit. We're certainly not. But we're lying to ourselves if we believe that our contempt for the people most responsible is actually helping.

So then what are we supposed to do? After all, the only thing required for evil to thrive is for the good to do nothing. On the other hand, the only thing worse than letting evil win is secretly joining forces with it. I can't give a complete solution, but here's a start.

We must each become deeply aware of this darkness within. Otherwise, _every single thing_ we do to "fight" evil secretly just strengthens it, despite our conviction that we're helping. This rabbit hole goes deep — and the deeper we go, the more we perceive something curious: nobody _else_ wants to be infected by their parasite either, despite (what appears to be) compelling evidence to the contrary. Even those who _say_ they enjoy cruelty — the ones we classically think of as "evil" — are suffering from a kind of Stockholm Syndrome.

The more free we become of our parasite, the more we begin to perceive the "great battles" that are tricking other people into protecting theirs — even when they're not aware of these battles themselves. There is always an aspect of people's minds that doesn't want to be under its sway. This isn't just a belief; it is something you begin to _perceive._

Seeing this clearly enables us to behave in ways that help people evict their parasites — the only thing that genuinely removes evil from the world. (We may think that straight-up murdering evil people does too — but when it is done maliciously, it amplifies the darkness in others' minds, resulting in a net gain. Don't ask me how this works, but it is something you can learn to see. There is no "free lunch" here. We cannot bypass the hard inner work.)

[//]: # (Smothering their light. Extremely difficult to confront the full extent of our complicity. Inner Light. We also project badness when there is none.)

Such behavior is _compassion_ or _kindness_, and it doesn't mean being nice. Sometimes it must be fierce or even violent. But it comes from a completely different aspect of mind, and your "target" can sense this difference, even if only subconsciously. Their devil cannot find the slightest "hook" in your mind by which to justify itself, and so it is weakened, even if only imperceptibly. If you feel even a trace of self-righteousness — no matter how well hidden — you are giving it this hook.

In fact, if you even perceive the other person as "other," then there is still work left to be done. This is the hardest part to talk about. Reality is actually one seamless interconnected whole, and our separation is only apparent. This truth isn't unveiled fully until _enlightenment_, but we can all sense it to one degree or another at all times. The less a person senses this, the more "evil" they appear — and our cruelty is an attempt to make them sense it less. It is _exactly_ the wrong thing to do.

To be clear, compassion does not always tell you what the most helpful behavior _is_. That requires wisdom, which is a separate but related skill. Compassion just ensures that you are acting in accordance with your deepest values; that you are not falling victim to your self-deception. Before it is firmly in place, our strategies to defeat evil are actually no such thing. They always secretly contain an element meant to elevate or enrich us at the world's expense, unbeknownst to us.

Our true enemy is not actually other people. It is the powerful darkness that has captivated all of our minds. We each have a role to play in dispelling it, and it begins with ourselves. When we cannot see the Light in others — or worse, when we are convinced that it does not exist — this means we still have work to do. This is what we must remember if humanity is to survive.

What if nearly everything you're doing to "fight evil" is actually strengthening it — and moreover, what if part of you already knows this but is actively concealing it from your conscious mind?

There's an insidious mechanism in the minds of "bad people" that shields them from confronting the full implications of their misbehavior. It's not that they _don't_ know that they're doing wrong. Part of them knows perfectly well — but the visceral _wrongness_ is very cleverly shielded from conscious self-reflection. It is this same dark state that has enabled _all the evil there ever was_ — and it has enabled our own misbehavior too, if we're honest. Every one of us has skirted our conscience before, pretending that we either couldn't hear it or didn't have to listen.

It's the same thing that's happening when you feel contempt for those very people — or, indeed, perceive them as (fundamentally) bad in the first place. This sentiment feels totally righteous; like it's there to help you _fight_ their evil. But this is a sinister lie. Contempt (for people) exists **only** to shield you from what your subconscious is secretly doing: preparing to justify behaviors that will elevate or otherwise enrich you at the world's expense — and make you feel _good_ about it.

I cannot convince you of this, for precisely the same reason that you cannot force the "bad people" to confront what they are doing: the more aggressively you try, the harder their mind will shield it from them — and thus the more "evil" they will appear to you. Now for the kicker: _this isn't by accident._ It's not just an unfortunate side-effect of your otherwise noble intentions, like your mind tries to make you believe. _It's secretly the whole point._

Something in us delights in shoving the "bad people" further into the abyss, but it cannot make this too obvious, so it comes up with a fiendish plan. It alters our very perception, so that we don't see a fellow human in the grip of a terrible mechanism that we ourselves share — indeed, that is controlling our minds _at this very moment_. No, we see someone who is _fundamentally defective_; totally unlike us. They therefore cannot be helped; they must be punished.

This part of you knows that by simply harboring this malevolent intention, you will appear to _them_ as fundamentally defective — because their subconscious recognizes that you're in the grip of self-deception. Far from seeing you as someone with the moral authority to be judging them, they will perceive you as someone who needs to be put in your place; someone for whom harm is justified. You will in turn take this as proof of their defectiveness, closing the loop on the sinister plot.

Before we continue, let's pause to appreciate the elegant beauty of this ploy. You didn't have to do anything overtly evil. All that was required was to _harbor a dark intention_. That's what contempt *is*. This is something that is easy to lie to yourself about, and even easier to hide from others — at least, consciously. But we are all subconsciously sensitive to it, which is what allows it to work.

But we're only scratching the surface of the true depths of the horror.

This is all enabled by a kind of mind-virus. The Buddhists know it as the _ego_, and it's also commonly depicted as the devil on your shoulder. It is the thing in you that needs you to be _special_; to elevate yourself above the world somehow. In some people, it manifests as a desire for wealth; in others, the need to look and feel like a "good person."

However it manifests, it will achieve its aim in one way or another — even if it requires stomping on others. For the "bad people," this is straightforward: it just needs to convince them that harming people is okay. For the "good people," it is a bit trickier. We know that cruelty is generally wrong, so we need to be clever about it. We thus divide the world into (fundamentally) good and bad people; those who deserve our compassion and those who do not. The latter are worthy of harm.

Despite our differences, there is one thing all of our devils have in common: whenever we obey their seductive voices, we induce others to do the same. The "greedy banker" _invites_ our contempt; we accept this invitation by nastily judging them for it, which just convinces them that the idiots they're harming deserve it, which convinces us that... etc. They get to have more wealth, and we get to feel more self-righteous. Win-win.

Our devils are _always_ subconsciously coordinating like this. In fact, they're not really independent. From a certain perspective, they behave more like outgrowths of a single malevolent distributed entity: the _Devil_, if you will. **This is the hardest thing to describe, but the most important thing for humanity to become aware of.** We are all harboring a piece of our true nemesis, and protecting it to the death.

This "dark entity" continually drives humanity toward various kinds of Armageddon: situations in which everyone is violently defeating the evil "others." It is why the US is headed toward civil war without anyone suspecting their own complicity, and explains bitter [divorces](https://www.gottman.com/blog/this-one-thing-is-the-biggest-predictor-of-divorce/) in which each side feels like the exclusive victim / hero. Nearly the whole world is caught in its terrible sway, evil provoking "righteous" retribution at every turn, without anyone ever noticing the true source of it all.

You know how people sometimes suspect that there's an "evil global conspiracy" lurking in the shadows, secretly running the show behind the scenes? They are not crazy. _This_ is what they are subconsciously sensing. 

To be clear: there are certainly groups of especially-infected people who conspire to cause great harm, but even they are ultimately subordinate to the _primordial_ conspiracy; one that we are _all_ secretly members of. Every time we feel malice, contempt, or even self-righteousness toward _anyone_; every single time we are unkind, we are strengthening the Beast; reinforcing the conditions that effectively _compel_ the existence of our enemies. And the craziest thing is that _part of us already knows this._

It is impossible to overstate the shock of discovering, for the first time, that you have _always_ been in on the "evil global conspiracy." It is terrifying, heartbreaking, and humbling all at once. We realize all at once what utter hypocrites we are; that we have no leg to stand on if we're still contemptuously judging others.

I keep using the word "subconscious" to describe this behavior, but that's not quite accurate. **It is completely accessible to consciousness, if you know how to look.**

[//]: # (If we suddenly became consciously aware that we've been creating more evil, we would go insane from the shock of discovering our hypocrisy.  )

Its greatest trick is to prevent us from suspecting, let alone detecting, our own role in keeping it alive. We only ever see the aspects of it that live "out there," which we then feel compelled to violently attack — but this just makes it stronger. We never notice that it is the aspect "in here" that initiated this perception and behavior in the first place. We are tilting at windmills. Any time we feel contempt, malice, or even self-righteousness toward _anybody,_ we are just feeding the Beast.

It's not that we're _not_ supposed to fight the evil out there. But to the degree that we are not yet free of our own self-deception, we are only capable of strengthening it in others. We pat ourselves on the back for "fighting evil" and then lament the increasingly sorry state of the world — which we then must "unfortunately" fight even harder. We never suspect that something within us _wants_ this.

It is what the Buddhists know as the "ego" — the part of us that needs to feel special. For some people this may be about accumulating wealth, and in others it is about being "good people." It makes us perceive other people in whatever way necessary to justify behavior that will bolster our self-image. For "good people," our subconscious is on the prowl for anyone we can plausibly see as "bad," so that we can make them _worse_ — via behaviors that appear righteous on the surface.

To be clear: there are surely groups of particularly "endarkened" people who consciously conspire to cause great harm, and **we must hold such people accountable** — but when we do so with contempt, we are secretly (and on a subconscious level, _knowingly_) reinforcing the very conditions that effectively compel their existence. All such "conspiracies" ultimately filter up to the primordial conspiracy that we ourselves are members of. They cannot be defeated without our seeing this.

This is not just a wacky theory or

If you manage to take your own egoic mechanism offline for even a moment, it feels exactly like you'd imagine feeling if you were suddenly freed from a demonic possession. You clearly perceive how this "demon" has very cleverly commandeered people's minds.

Seeing this all clearly turns your whole world upside-down. We are hating people for their susceptibility to the world's most fiendish mind-virus — the one responsible for our very hatred. And this hatred exists for no other reason than to push them further _into_ its evil clutches.

(To be fair, there does seem to be a tiny percentage of people who have consciously welcomed the demon in, for whom the description "evil" really does capture something important. Such people pose a unique challenge. Being "kind" to them in the conventional sense can indeed be dangerous. And yet the very _deepest_ aspect of their mind does not want it. Again, it is only once you see exactly what "it" is that you understand why _nobody_ ultimately could. Think of it like a form of Stockholm syndrome. If you want to defeat evil, you must want them to be free of it, too.)

What lies beneath the ego is something like a boundless love for all of reality. You see that you aren't really fundamentally separate from it. Any harm you cause to the world is ultimately done to yourself. The recognition of this "absolute good" within is what slowly brings the process of self-deception to an end.

This "absolute good" is something that we cannot take any credit for. Instead, we can only feel profound gratitude for whatever grace allowed us to discover it, and heartbreak that it still remains so deeply hidden in others. The hardest part is watching the whole world being casually cruel to each other, unaware of which "team" they are secretly fighting for. It inspires a fierce determination to end the "possession" that has captured people's minds, instead of deepening it like we've unwittingly been doing. We clearly see the face of our true nemesis for the first time.

This doesn't mean that you will suddenly become nice or lovey-dovey toward evildoers. You may still need to be fierce, or perhaps even violent[^dalai-lama-gun]. Mockery, shaming, or even _apparent_ contempt might still be useful tools in your arsenal. But these will be in the service of _freeing_ people from the darkness, not pushing them further in. It is a kind of "tough love," and feels _nothing_ like the self-righteous antagonism that we normally feel when "fighting evil." You are still "connected to your heart." **That is what is most crucial.** Others can sense the profoundly benevolent intent (even if only subconsciously), and it makes _all the difference in the world_.

---

In every interaction you have two options: to either encourage the Light in others, or to fight their darkness with yours. Again: **encouraging their Light has nothing to do with being _nice_**. It is about being completely unwilling to abandon your own Light under _any circumstances_ — including the one that their darkness is presently testing you with. Their darkness is looking for a "hook" in your mind that it can use to justify itself — some sign that even you, the "good person," are weak to its seduction. If you refuse to abandon your integrity even then, the fierceness of your Light subjugates their darkness. They subconsciously remember that _the Light_ isn't just a myth.

This is authentic kindness (aka compassion). It is "radical" for two reasons. First, it contradicts our usual intuition that some people "deserve" it while others don't. It could never be the case that some people deserve to be shoved further into the abyss while others deserve to be freed from it. Second, it need not look anything like "kindness" in the conventional sense (though most often, it will). It certainly doesn't have to be soft or weak.

I know it feels like some people don't _have_ an inner Light to encourage, but this is just an illusion that our darkness uses to get its foot in the door. By the time it has tricked us into dividing the world into fundamentally "good" and "bad" people — which feels like the most natural thing in the world — it has already infected the deepest aspect of our minds. Then, it can bide its time fostering conditions that will get us to commit unspeakable horror in the name of "good."[^genocide]

There are so many people in the world for whom it is natural to feel contempt — the hypocrites; the downright evil; the aggressively stupid; the willfully ignorant — and there seem to be more by the day. We probably know that we're not "supposed" to feel contempt, but that seems like an unreasonable and increasingly outmoded religious idea. How _else_ are we supposed to deal with such despicable people?

The truth is that we don't actually feel contempt to help anyone or anything: that's just a story we tell ourselves to maintain our self-image. We do it for a much less noble reason; one that will take a minute to unpack.

If you could actually see other people's minds in their full complexity, you would discover that the very deepest aspect of them doesn't — indeed _couldn't_ — want to be any of the aforementioned things. Certainly _some_ part of them does — and that's the part we imagine we're directing our contempt at. But what happens is that their defense mechanisms just kick in and intercept our attack, causing them to dig in their heels. We then get to feel contempt for this incorrigibility, too.

What we can't see — or admit — is that our behavior was subconsciously _designed_ to trigger those very defense mechanisms _so that_ we could feel licensed to escalate our disdain. We _want_ "bad people" to get worse, so that we can continue to gloat over them. It doesn't matter how "bad" someone is, or in what sense they are "bad": contempt is _only ever_ designed to trigger this reaction for the sake of our egos.

With training, it is actually possible to see — and communicate with — the part of people that doesn't want to be deplorable; the very deepest aspect of their minds. This is called _compassion,_ and it is profoundly misunderstood. It doesn't mean being _nice._ Such "communication" may _look_ like contempt — or even violence — from the outside, but feels nothing like it from the inside. The recipient can sense the profoundly benevolent intent (even if only subconsciously), and it makes _all the difference in the world._ This may not be immediately evident — and it doesn't provide us with the satisfying hit of self-righteousness that actual contempt does — but it is of genuine benefit.



---
---

Do it to hide our similarity.

It is why our faith in humanity is restored when we witness acts of kindness, and why we sometimes thank others for being generous with strangers even when no (apparent) benefit comes to us. It is why certain literature speaks to us so deeply, despite making very little _rational_ sense.

[^child]: Not that there will be familial love, or indeed "love" in the conventional sense of the word.

Pause and reflect on what's wrong with the world, and bring to mind the people responsible — the "bad people." Don't they know that they're being evil — and if they don't, then _shouldn't_ they? Either way, they seem fundamentally morally defective and thus deserving of contempt.

It turns out that _contempt_ can only be generated from within this state. Why?

The reason that "bad people" need to rely on self-deception is that some part of them _doesn't want to be doing wrong._ This means that they are not "fundamentally" morally defective. They are far more like us than we are willing to admit.

Something in your mind is actively shielding you from seeing this. It does this by making you feel contempt — a toxic emotion that you would otherwise never feel. That in turn causes you to act in ways that provoke your target into doing things that justify your contempt, thus licensing more righteous wrath — the most delicious feeling of all.

When you do this, others can tell — even if only subconsciously, and even if you cannot — that you are acting maliciously, and not for the benefit of the world. This appears evil to them for precisely the same reason that they do to you. They know that you are trying to push them further into the dark and calling this "righteous." They thus perceive you as someone lacking the moral authority to be scornfully judging anyone, and feel the urge to put you in _your_ place.

Part of you _knew_ this would happen, and _wanted_ it, because it "proves" that you were right about them. After all, any decent person would have simply repented in the face of such noble fury.

Contempt is a self-reinforcing delusion whose only purpose is to prevent you from discovering our shared humanity, by encouraging others not to. It is a way to keep people trapped in darkness while feeling good about it. It is _evil._ Full stop.

This can be incredibly difficult to admit to ourselves, but it's also necessary. If we don't see this, it means that we're still immersed in self-deception — and in this state, we cannot _reduce_ the self-deception of others; we can only amplify it. In other words, we can only inspire more evil, despite what we may consciously tell ourselves.

Perhaps MLK said it best:

> *Darkness cannot drive out darkness; only light can do that. Hate cannot drive out hate; only love can do that.*

Evil is not actually a _presence_ (like it seems), but an _absence_. The absence of what? Of the perception of the profound interconnectedness of all life. This absence cannot be "extinguished"; it can only be dispelled through illumination. This may sound like spiritual mumbo-jumbo, but part of you knows exactly what I mean. Everything comes down to remembering this. The more you do, the more you remember how to banish evil.

This is called _compassion_ (or what MLK called "love") — but it doesn't mean being _nice_ or lovey-dovey. Sometimes it must be fierce, or perhaps even violent, as we will later see.

---

Although evil is an absence, there _is_ a terrifying way in which it behaves like a presence.



---
---


This feeling is a lie. Part of you knows that you are not "fundamentally" better than anyone. Contempt exists only to maintain this lie: it causes you to provoke them into behaving in ways that _prove_ their "badness," thus licensing even more contempt. That is its _only_ purpose.

This behavior makes the world darker — something a "good person" isn't supposed to do. So your subconscious hides this fact from you, making you perceive your behavior as _righteous._ Any increased darkness can be blamed entirely on them. This is a form of self-deception.

It turns out that self-deception is also how the "bad people" are able to do what _they_ do without remorse. They know perfectly well when what they are doing is wrong, but the _wrongness_ is cleverly hidden from conscious self-reflection.

This wouldn't be necessary unless _some_ part of them didn't want to be doing it. Consciously, you may not believe this, but subconsciously, you can perceive it. But now you're in an even bigger pickle: your attempt to prove how different you were just proves how similar you are.

---
---

Something deep within us knows that there's no _intrinsic_ difference between us and them; that we ourselves are capable of almost anything under the right circumstances. Our subconscious uses contempt to help this fact stay hidden from consciousness. It does its job well, which is why you may not believe me when I say that you already know this.

To take an everyday example: consider what happens when we mock our political opponents. Don't they just dig in their heels, see _us_ as evil, and vow to fight harder? We tell ourselves that we had "good intentions" (to shut them up; force them to introspect; convince others not to join them, etc.), but the truth is that something in us is _trying_ to maintain the polarization.

This ultimately harms the world, and part of us knows it. But "good people" don't do such things, and so we must hide this fact from consciousness. But wait a minute: what if the "bad people" are doing exactly the same thing? What if they're hiding _their_ misbehavior from conscious self-reflection, too — which would only be necessary if there's some part of them that doesn't want to be doing it, which means that... oh, sh*t, maybe our cruelty isn't so noble after all. Maybe we're just shoving that part of them further into the abyss. That would be _evil._

It's not that they don't know that what they're doing is wrong. The worst people will even openly _admit_ that it is, and that they enjoy it. But even then, this knowledge must remain cleverly hidden 

I'm not speaking hypothetically. If you look carefully enough at your mind while feeling contempt — and this is _hard_ — you will find that part of you can actually perceive this about people, and is searching for clever ways to gleefully push them further into the dark and then hiding this from yourself, just to bolster your own self-image. Not to put too fine a point on it, but this is _evil_ — and this is true _regardless_ of how bad they are or what they've done.

But you don't do this because you're a "bad person": that very notion is the problem. You do this because of a strange quirk of human psychology — one that is best described in mythopoetic terms.




---

But just pause and reflect on how much more viscerally satisfying it is to watch a bad person "get owned" than to have a change of heart. The latter would rob us of the unspeakably gratifying pleasure of seeing evil get "destroyed."

Our contempt naturally leads to malice, which is a very effective way to help "bad people" stay bad. Even if there is a tiny part of them that wishes to be free of their darkness — a possibility that we flatly refuse to countenance — we ensure that it stays suppressed. In the same way that witnessing acts of kindness can restore your faith in humanity, your malicious intent is (secretly) designed to produce the opposite effect in your target and all others who witness it. Your "allies" will subconsciously reframe this as a "necessary evil," and thus noble.

Keeping people trapped in the dark is hardly the mark of a "good person," and so this drive must remain subconscious.


---
---

Why is it so hard to eradicate evil? Could it be that something within us is secretly fighting to keep it alive?

That might sound absurd to you, or even offensive. Yet it is the truth — and without seeing this clearly, we have no hope of winning the fight.

---

When you think about the "bad people" of the world — whoever they are — it's hard not to feel at least a little contempt. But this emotion isn't merely counterproductive: it's a sign of something much darker.

If you look carefully enough into your mind while you are feeling contempt, you will discover that something in you is secretly plotting a way to create _more hostility_ in the world. Of course, it will not tell you this: instead, you will feel like you are doing something _righteous._

To take a simple example, consider what happens when we mock our political opponents. Don't they just dig in their heels, see _us_ as evil, and vow to fight harder? We tell ourselves that we had "good intentions" (to shut them up; force them to introspect; convince others not to join them, etc.), but the truth is that something in us _wants_ more polarization, because it allows us to feel self-righteous — as delicious a feeling as they come.

As a more extreme example, didn't the architects of the "War on Terror" _know_ that indiscriminately bombing the sh*t out of people would just inspire a new wave of "terrorists" who they would then "unfortunately" have to destroy too? The answer is both yes and no: a part of them certainly knew, but they were only able to justify it to themselves by shielding the immense _wrongness_ from conscious self-reflection; from the part of them that would put an end to it if forced to confront it.

We can see this in their eyes when they speak: they are clearly lying through their teeth when they pretend they did it for noble reasons. But if this inspires contempt in you, then what you're not seeing is that _your eyes are taking on precisely the same look!_

It is completely inevitable: any time you feel contempt, your mind is secretly trying to increase the enmity in the world while finding a way to convince you that it is good — and it _will_ find a way.

Why is it so hard to eradicate evil? Could it be that something within us is secretly fighting to keep it alive?

That might sound absurd to you, or even offensive. Yet it is the truth — and without seeing this clearly, we have no hope of winning the fight.

---

Let's start with an obvious example: why do we enjoy mocking our political opponents? The first thing to acknowledge is that we _do_ enjoy it. We can come up with numerous reasons why it's helpful (it shuts them up; it forces them to introspect; it convinces others not to join them, etc.), but there's a much darker reason for our enjoyment.

Part of us knows that it will lead to increased polarization, and we _want_ this. Why? Because there is something uniquely gratifying about violently defeating evil — and the more clearly we highlight theirs, the exponentially more satisfying it will be when we finally extinguish it once and for all. We need their evil to be unmistakable so that we can feel completely righteous about the profound violence that we intend to visit upon it.

Part of us believes that we are merely honing in on the evil that is already there, but another part of us knows that we are also _provoking_ it. We may believe that such provocation wouldn't work if they had any decency, and so the fact that it _does_ is proof that they are intrinsically bad — but we don't realize just how outrageously clever we are at pushing people's buttons. Something in us _needs_ people to be fundamentally broken, and will stop at nothing to "prove" it.

We may be aware of this dark tendency in ourselves, and evey try to avoid it, but it goes far deeper than we realize. And mockery is far from the only tool that we use: any time we perceive someone as _fundamentally morally defective_ — evil, in short — _something_ about our behavior will be secretly designed to provoke it, whether we are conscious of this or not. It is completely inevitable. It might be as subtle as stoking outrage in others, to lay the groundwork for future action.

So what's the solution then? To just let evil win? No. The trick is to understand how it works.

We've all had the experience of skirting our conscience, either by pretending that we couldn't hear it, or that we could safely ignore it. Try to remember what that state is like. It is a kind of self-deception. This is the secret mechanism behind _all the evil there ever was._ People know perfectly well when they're doing something wrong, but the _wrongness_ is carefully shielded from conscious self-reflection. 

Their subconscious shielding is so clever that it convinces us (and often even them) that _no_ part of them knows — which could only mean that they are, indeed, fundamentally defective. Thus begins our righteous assault.

Here's the thing: as we saw, our attack is surreptitiously designed to provoke more evil. If you inspect your mind carefully enough while this is happening — and this is hard — you'll discover a horrifying truth: that part of you _knows_ this is wrong, but you are carefully shielding this fact from yourself. In other words, you are being self-deceptive — and this will make _you_ appear evil in _their_ eyes. And this isn't by accident: it is precisely what enables your provocation to work. Of _course_ they are going to react poorly to what they perceive as evil! This was the secret plan all along!

This can be extremely hard to admit to ourselves, for obvious reasons. But until we do, we can never understand what drives other people's evil, and are thus incapable of healing it. 

Our behavior isn't nearly as bad as that of people who commit atrocities — and our self-deception is correspondingly much weaker. Yet despite this, we _still_ struggle to confront it. It is always painful to discover that we've been deceiving ourselves, and this is only _more_ true for the "bad people." That's what prevents them from confronting the full wrongness. We think that their misbehavior should be _more_ obvious to them, but we've got it exactly backward — and we are _motivated_ to.

If you want the "bad people" to confront their misbehavior — which is the only way to end it — you _must_ understand how their self-deception works. This is not an intellectual thing that you can get from a book. It requires seeing how it operates in your own mind. You will know you've succeeded when you stop seeing "evil people," and no longer feel even a trace of malice or self-righteousness toward anyone. These are unmistakable signs that it is still operating in you.

---

If you had instead perceived them not as "fundamentally defective" but as engaged in profound self-deception — which is the truth — then you would have behaved very differently. You might still have leveraged mockery (or perhaps even violence), but there would have been no trace of self-righteousness to it — and others can subconsciously detect this. It prevents their "evil" from finding the hook that it needs to justify itself.



There is obviously something very different about what we are doing and what the "evil people" are, but there is also something very much the same — and as long as we harbor that part of ourselves, we are always at risk of becoming them, whether like to admit this or not.

[^armageddon] We also know that this "Armageddon" that we are trying to provoke — the day when our Good violently prevails over their Evil — will not lead to lasting peace. It is just another form of escalation itself.


---
---

What if nearly everything you're doing to "fight evil" is actually strengthening it — and moreover, what if part of you already knows this, but is carefully hiding it from your conscious mind? What if the difficulty admitting this to yourself is caused by precisely the same mechanism that prevents the "bad people" from fully realizing what _they_ are doing?

These are provocative questions, but they point at an astonishing truth. The Devil hides in the very last place you would ever look.

---
---

Why is it so hard to eradicate evil? What if the tools we've been using to fight it are secretly weapons _of_ it?

Take a moment to think about what's "wrong with the world" and bring to mind the people responsible. Do this until you can really feel some animosity. They obviously know that what they're doing is wrong, and deserve to be punished for it.

We all know that we're not "supposed" to hate people (even bad ones), and that it's "right" to show them compassion. But these admonishments have little impact on us until we see exactly _why._ There's something truly astonishing to see here.

When you feel animosity, your mind is secretly gearing up to harm the world in some way that you won't consciously recognize as harmful. A simple example is when we mock our political opponents. We may describe it as "fighting evil," but part of us knows that we're only doing it to provoke them into behavior that will justify even more mockery — or worse.

It's not that mockery has no place in the fight against evil. Sometimes it may indeed be a helpful tool. But when we wield it with animosity, we're not actually _trying_ to help anyone — certainly not them, but not even the world. We're just justifying our vengeful instincts by dressing them up as righteous. This may be a hard pill to swallow, but it's crucial that we see this clearly.

There is a bizarre state that our minds occupy, in which we hide our true intentions from even ourselves. We know perfectly well that what we're doing is wrong, but that _wrongness_ is carefully hidden from conscious self-reflection. This is precisely the state that the "bad people" are in, and until we see clearly how it operates in ourselves, we have no hope of defeating the evil "out there."

This state is caused by a kind of mind-virus, and an especially clever one. It makes us do its bidding without ever realizing that we are infected. One of its greatest tricks is to make us search for other "infectees" and then behave in ways that will _deepen_ their infection: we find the "bad people" and then provoke them into becoming _worse._ The way this works is fascinating.

By activating our malice, it makes us appear evil to them (and to everyone else, whether they are consciously aware of it or not. Our "allies" are mostly not, for obvious reasons). This serves as a signal to _their_ viruses that we too are infected. The parasites then perform a kind of "secret handshake," in which they agree to empower each other while convincing us, their hosts, that we are fighting.

Think back to the "mocking your political opponents" example. Consciously, you feel like enemies, but if you introspect carefully enough, you'll find that your darkness is secretly _allied_ with theirs. Your parasites have a common goal: to increase the animosity in the world, while convincing you that this is _righteous_ and _necessary_. Evil never actually _fights_ evil; it is always on the same team.

If you zoom out, you wil discover that _all_ of our parasites are secretly allied in this way. In fact, if you are perceptive enough, you will notice that they behave more like outgrowths of a single malevolent "distributed organism" that is manipulating _all_ of our minds. This isn't some abstract theory: as best I can tell, everyone who pays careful enough attention eventually discovers this.

Every time you feel hatred, malice, contempt, or even just self-righteousness, you are secretly feeding the Beast. It is completely inevitable. If you think you've found an exception — some uniquely evil person who _requires_ your malice — it just means that you are being manipulated especially hard. Alas, I won't be able to talk you out of it any more than you can simply talk them out of _their_ infection.

Even before you feel malice, there is an easy way to detect your infection. If you perceive the world as being comprised by "good people" and "bad people," the parasite has already accomplished most of its work. There is no actually dividing line; there are only those of us who are presently more and less infected. 

---


This doesn't mean we're "bad people." In fact, the very root of the problem is dividing the world into "good people" and "bad people"; those who deserve our compassion and those who deserve our animosity. That division exists for only one purpose: to provide you with people who it feels _right_ to mistreat.

In the same way that we dress up certain misbehavior as "righteous," the "bad people" do too. It is a kind of self-deception, and everything comes down to seeing how it works. 


---
---

People are only able to misbehave while under the sway of a particular mind-virus. People who are frequently under its sway we call "bad people," and those who are most deeply infected we call "evil people."

You are infected by this virus, too. It's mostly dormant, but it gets triggered when you encounter "bad people." It makes you want to be cruel to them — even if it's just light cruelty, such as mocking.

You may think that there's nothing wrong with mocking bad people, but that's the whole point: while under the sway of the virus, you never feel like you are. Misbehavior somehow just feels... _right._ That's why the "bad people" are able to do what they do.

Part of you knows perfectly well that you don't mock your enemies to help them "see the light," but mostly to provoke them into behaving in ways that will justify more mockery... or worse. But it is _so hard_ to admit this to yourself while you're doing it. It feels so convincingly like you're "fighting evil."

While possessed by the virus, there is always a part of you that _knows_ — but that part gets smaller and smaller the worse the infection gets. Even in "evil people," there is a tiny part that knows — their "inner light," so to speak — but this part is very hard for them to access.

We cannot tell when we are under the sway of our virus, but other people can. In fact, we _want_ them to. Why? Because the same way that other infected people look "evil" to us, we look (slightly) evil to others while in its grip. That's what makes mocking our enemies so effective: they feel like they're being judged by a _bad person,_ which is something they won't tolerate. Who would?

If you look carefully, you will discover that the desire to be cruel to "evil people" is secretly a desire to push their "inner light" deeper into the abyss; to deepen their infection. This is _malevolent._ That doesn't make you a "bad person" — if I thought so, I'd just be making the same mistake. What's happening is that their virus is triggering yours, as if through resonance.

If you "listen" carefully, you can hear all of our viruses resonating together. It is like a background hum of evil. At any given moment, mine is ready to trigger yours, and vice versa. They only need the right conditions.


To be clear, it's not that mockery is always wrong. Sometimes it can be a helpful tool.

What is the best way to fight evil? The obvious answer is to find the "evil people" and defeat them, but there is a very good reason that this plan hasn't been working: it's actually not meant to.

Evil behaves like a parasite that infects people's minds and alters their very perception. It makes the "infectee" see certain other people as subhuman, and thus fair game for cruelty. They know perfectly well that this is wrong at _some_ level, but the parasite cleverly shields that "wrongness" from conscious self-reflection. It is a form of self-deception.

We are all familiar with this schism of mind. We've all had the experience of skirting our conscience, either by pretending that we couldn't hear it, or that we could get away with overriding it. It is a kind of self-deception, and it is precisely this mechanism that enables _all_ evil.

When the parasite infects someone who considers themselves a "good person" — like you or me — it does something especially clever: the "certain other people" who it makes look subhuman are the "bad people." Think about it: doesn't it feel positively _righteous_ to treat those people with cruelty? It may be hard to admit this to yourself, but part of you knows that this is a dangerous lie.

When we viciously attack a "bad person," part of them can sense that we are under the sway of exactly the same parasite that they are. Therefore, we have no moral authority by which to judge them. So, far from simply repenting, they now see _us_ as evil, and include us in their group of "people who deserve cruelty." We take this as confirmation that they, likewise, belong in _ours._

This plan _can't_ work to end evil, because it was designed by the parasite _not_ to work. On the contrary, it is specifically designed to _strengthen_ the grip of the parasite in all of our minds — and it is working astonishingly well. Somehow, after thousands of years, we haven't caught on to its trick.

So is the solution to _not_ fight "evil people"? Not exactly. The trick is to see that there _are_ no "evil people"; only people who are more and less infected by the parasite. Once you see this — really _see_, and not just _believe_ — you no longer feel like you are fighting _people_. You are only ever fighting the parasite that has infected _all_ of our minds.

Sometimes, fighting the parasite certainly takes the _form_ of fighting people. So then what's the difference? You never feel _malice_, the sinister pleasure of watching people be harmed. You're not gleefully shoving the "bad people" further into the dark, like you were when under the sway of your parasite. You feel no _self-righteousness_; the sense that you are fundamentally better than anyone else. You can now see clearly that you are not; that this idea has **always** been the parasite talking.

This is called _compassion,_ and other people can sense it. There is no particular form that it must take. It can be fierce or even violent if necessary. But your fundamental benevolence prevents their parasites from using your evil as justification to further infect their minds. This makes **all** the difference in the world. It is the only way to actually fight evil instead of unwittingly spreading it.

That is why the fight against evil _must_ begin with doing everything in your power to find and evict the parasite that has secretly commandeered your mind.

There is something uniquely pleasurable about violently punishing evil, so our subconscious does something very clever: it seeks out "evil people" and then makes us behave in ways that provoke them, so that we feel licensed to escalate our righteous wrath. Part of us would be disappointed if they were to instead "see the light" and repent — even though that would be far better for the world. It is more satisfying to watch them suffer.

The really clever part is _how_ we provoke them. The mere _intention_ to provoke evil is itself evil — and their subconscious can sense this. It makes them perceive _us_ as evil, which they then feel compelled to fight. But because we are convinced that we are behaving righteously, we take this as confirmation that they are indeed evil — precisely what we needed to license escalation.

Our subconscious secretly orchestrated this, but it hid the plan from our conscious minds. This is self-deception. As it turns out, this is precisely the mechanism behind _all_ forms of evil: people know perfectly well when what they are doing is wrong, but the _wrongness_ is carefully hidden from conscious self-reflection.

This behavior is caused by a kind of parasite that lives in our minds. It manipulates our very perception so that we literally _see_ some people as deserving of malice. For you, it is the "bad people" — those who are fundamentally morally defective. But the thing is, they're not _fundamentally_ defective; they're actually under the sway of the very same parasite.

Your parasite is tricking you into overlooking the parasite in others, so that you behave in ways that give _their_ parasite the ammo it needs to trick them into doing the same right back at us. Don't you see? Your parasite and theirs aren't enemies — they are _allies!_ **All** of our parasites are allied, getting us to behave in ways that strengthen each other's at every turn.

This is that secret "evil global conspiracy" that everyone fears exists — and part of it lives within your very own mind. While under its terrible sway, every single thing you do to "fight" evil out there only amplifies it.

Its greatest trick is to convince you that it does not live in your mind, but only "out there." Maybe you think that okay, fine, you have a _tiny_ role to play in the world's ills, but still, the evil people are the real problem. But the truth is, once you are totally free of your parasite, that illusion falls apart — because you now directly perceive their parasites.

This has the effect of driving their darkness deeper into their minds, making it appear even more surely intrinsic, which inspires even more righteous violence from us, in a downward spiral. We act dismayed by their recalcitrance, but our darkness actually orchestrated this descent. We may not be conscious of this, but our "victim" is certain that we are, again for the same reason that we are sure that _their_ evil is fully volitional.

Our darkness tricks us into behaving in ways that will convince others that ours is intrinsic, because it knows exactly how theirs operates and will respond — _because ours and theirs are identical_. In fact, they are not just identical, but are more like outgrowths of a single shared "shadowy presence" that continually manipulates all of our minds; the _Devil_, if you will.

This is not just a wacky religious idea: it seems that everyone who introspects carefully enough eventually perceives this "distributed malevolent entity" which has a kind of intelligence and volition of its own that, even if not _literally_ true, explain its seemingly-coordinated behavior far more accurately than if ours were independent.

Contempt is its most insidious tool precisely because it appears to be the most unmistakably righteous.

There may well be groups of particularly darkened people who conspire to cause great harm, but their existence wouldn't be possible if the rest of us weren't feeding the source — and conversely, it is _inevitable_ given that we are. **We must hold such people accountable**, but when we do this with contempt, we are injecting more evil into the world. It _will_ find a way to manifest somewhere, though we will disown all complicity for it.

The only way for humanity to defeat the Devil is to stop falling for its tricks. Any time you feel malice, hatred, contempt, or even self-righteousness toward another being; any time you see them as fundamentally defective or inferior; you are being manipulated, and this _will_ create more evil. As you begin to clear up this misperception in your own mind, you discover what is causing it in others'. Only then can you do anything genuinely useful about it.

The topic of what such "useful" behavior looks like is vast and is beyond our scope. Such behavior depends entirely on circumstances, and is impossible to reduce to principles, except for one: the more deeply it is rooted in compassion — i.e., free of the above misperception — the more beneficial it tends to be. Being _entirely_ free is enlightenment; perception of our fundamental unity. (Note that this profound unity is also what allows the Devil to exist.) Rest assured that compassionate action _can_ be outwardly violent.
