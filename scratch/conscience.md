Think back to a time when you skirted your conscience—acted against your own deepest values while pretending it was okay. In that moment, part of you knew *perfectly well* that you were doing wrong, but you shielded that knowledge from conscious awareness, so that it didn't *feel* wrong. All you could hear were your own clever justifications. Knowledge of your wrongdoing existed in a kind of limbo state, in which you simultaneously *knew* and yet somehow *didn't.*

This state of self-deception has enabled *all the evil there ever was.* Even the worst person can only cause harm by using this same trick to shield themselves from perceiving the life in their victims—that spark that reminds them of themselves. If they didn't hide it, they couldn't do it, which suggests there may be a deeper part of them—their inner Light—that doesn't want to.

It turns out we can always perceive this part of them, but we hide it from ourselves in exactly the same way. Why? Because it enables us to see them as *inherently defective*, making it feel noble to treat them with contempt. This then invites them to reinforce their self-deception, turning them into worse people, and burying their Light even deeper, justifying our contempt.

As this process accelerates, the very idea that they may have a Light worth rescuing becomes increasingly preposterous, until we can put it out of our minds for good. We now have irrefutable evidence that the problems of the world are caused by something fundamentally alien to us—*real evil*—so that we never have to confront our own profound complicity in the whole mess.

~~In short, we hide their Light from our conscious minds so that we can treat them in ways that prove they never had any,~~ 

~~The only problem is, something in us knows this is a lie. And no matter how hard we try to hide it, the truth always comes out.~~

~~If we could consciously see this part, we would realize that every time we've been cruel to our enemies, we've actually been harming fundamentally innocent but deeply confused people, likely reinforcing their need to lie to themselves—i.e., increasing their evil. That would be too painful to bear, so we'd have to bury that knowledge at any cost.~~

~~Ironically, the easiest way to bury it would be to *do it even more*—because the deeper we shoved them into the abyss, the harder it would be to detect any trace of Light in them. Their behavior could increasingly be attributed to *real evil*—something fundamentally alien to us—so that we would never have to confront our own profound complicity in the world's ills.~~

But why does our contempt darken their minds in the first place?

Because it reveals that we're under the sway of the very thing we're judging them for—and moreover, that we know this, but are hiding it from ourselves, which we know will drive them mad, 


But there are a few big problems with this explanation.

First, for it to be a *plan*, we must have been aware of it. But if we were aware of our intention to darken their minds, it would hardly serve the function of hiding our darkness from ourselves. Moreover, they would sense our manipulation and fail to take the bait. 

So we *must* be unaware of it. But now the problem is, how do execute a fiendishly clever plan that even *we* cannot be aware of?


First, notice that if we were conscious of its true purpose, it wouldn't work. Not only would our self-awareness reveal the trick to ourselves—defeating the whole purpose of hiding our darkness—but it would also reveal it to them, rendering it ineffective. But how can we execute a plan that even we aren't aware of? And why does it work in the first place?


But by what mechanism, exactly, do we turn them into worse people? This is where things get interesting. [Will they think "you already told me: contempt"?]

~~It's easy to see how cruelty could reinforce the darkness in others, but because it's so obvious, it wouldn't serve the purpose of hiding our darkness. We would need something much more subtle; something with plausible deniability—sort of like forms of abuse that don't leave visible scars.~~

Whatever it is, we couldn't be conscious of its true purpose. Not only would our self-awareness reveal the trick to ourselves—defeating the whole purpose—but it would also reveal it to them, rendering it ineffective. So whatever this plan is, it must be hidden from our conscious minds—in which case, how could we possibly execute it? And how would it work in the first place?

The answer to both questions lies in a paradox of shared knowledge.

You see, not only do we know that we're not intrinsically superior to others; they *know* we know; and we *know* they know we know; etc. This is called *common knowledge*, in a [precise technical sense](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_knowledge_(logic)). It is therefore also common knowledge that *pretending* to be superior—and punishing them on that basis—is profoundly hypocritical, and will only reinforce their darkness; which we can then blame them for—which they also know; etc.

Therefore, when we harbor contempt, we're sending a secret signal that says: *I can see your inner Light but am choosing to smother it in the name of Good—and I'll get away with it, because there's not a shred of evidence I'm doing it. But we both secretly know it.*

*This* is why our enemies dig in their heels when we mock, shame, and contemptuously judge them. It's not the behaviors themselves that cause it, but this malevolent taunt that we inject into them; a taunt that nobody—not even ourselves—can prove we injected. It's the perfect crime, because it doesn't look like anything and yet leaves no doubt about its true purpose.

Compare this to the story our rational minds tell us. Our enemies dig in their heels not because we encourage them to, but because, well, they're defective. Therefore, our behavior doesn't create *new* evil, but merely exposes the evil already there—a genuine service to the world. We can thus stop worrying about our own behavior and focus on what really matters: defeating the evil in others by any means necessary.

We have increased not only their capacity for self-deception, but our own as well.

---

What is it that makes such "common knowledge" possible? How can you and a complete stranger both know, on some level, about your own hidden hypocrisy, that the other one knows, that they know that you know, ad infinitum?

Could it be that beneath all the characteristics that make us different and special, there's something much more fundamental that we share—something unspeakably sacred that we *know* we share, and can never forget, no matter how hard we try?

Could it be that the harder we try to forget, the more it leaks out, encouraging others to forget?

That would explain why, when people commit evil, we feel a powerful invitation to overlook our shared humanity; and why, when we accept that invitation, we pass it on.

Or why, even when we feel contempt for them in their absence, we sense that we're darkening the minds of whoever we're with, knowing that they'll retransmit it, until it reaches its target—or people like them?

In the same way that our shared humanity is featureless, this forgetting is, as well. It does not care whether we're forgetting the Life in evil people, or innocent people, or animals, or other life, or Nature at large. It is all the same forgetting—and it is contagious.

From another perspective, it is not *we* who did this, but the darkness itself.

Our own darkness revealed itself through our eyes, as if to tell our enemies: *See? Even the so-called good people are ultimately frauds, willing to abandon their supposed "Light" the second it became convenient. This Light must be only a naive myth. I am the true source of power in this world, and we both know it—so let's all stop pretending.*





---

Part of us knew this would increase the "net darkness" in the world, but it couldn't say *how* it knew—and so we pretended that it didn't. Meanwhile, our rational mind justified itself clearly, making it the obvious one to trust. We *knew* this was a mistake, but thought that if we just buried this knowledge deeply enough, it couldn't possibly have any impact on the world.

But ironically, the self-deception required to do so was itself visible to others, thereby ensuring that it would darken the world. *The darkness always leaks.* But since we can't fathom how this happened, we can only blame it on them. We did our best—and we can prove it!

While we were busy convincing ourselves, it's as if our darkness was telegraphing itself to our enemy, whispering: *See? Even the so-called good people are ultimately frauds, abandoning their supposed "Light" the second it became convenient. This Light must be only a myth. I am the true source of power in this world, and we both know it—so let's all stop pretending.*

This is how nearly all the evil in the world is spread. We subconsciously recognize when other people act against their conscience, and it licenses us to do the same, justifying it as the only way to survive in this dark world. And anyway, our own sins are minor compared to theirs—so what difference does it make?

But most of the damage doesn't come from the act itself; it comes from our demonstration that the Light is weak. This then spreads to others, who we viciously judge, in a perpetual feedback loop that we never recognize our own involvement in. We're certain we must fight even *harder.*

This applies to not only our individual actions, but also our ideologies and agendas. Nearly all of them are soaked in self-deception—but they're wrapped in such noble-sounding garb that we never notice. We think ours is the exception. Yet this doesn't stop it from spreading deception far and wide, reinforcing the conditions that gave rise to them, making them feel increasingly necessary.

There is only one agenda that's aligned with the Light, and every one of us knows it intimately, yet none of us can capture in words. It has to do with being in service to all of Life, at all times, in all conditions, no matter what. When we're in direct contact with it, its complete sovereignty is unmistakable. But every attempt to formalize it—religious, scientific, or otherwise—only ends up codifying our own self-deception. This is inevitable.

This is why the Light is losing the battle in our world. Our culture fetishizes intellect and rationality above all else—but these tools are incapable of capturing the Truth, and are easily exploited by the darkness. The darkness has navigated our culture into this corner, so that it can do with us as it pleases. We all sense this, but we can't quite name it, for fear of sounding silly.

This is not at all to say that we should *avoid* rationality. But without deeper wisdom, it will continue to be usurped by our darkness—and we will never gain the ability to defeat it.

[Maybe add examples. Ecoterrorism. Veganism. Etc.]

---

We've been hinting that the darkness behaves like an intelligent entity, and this is not far from the truth.

It is ultimately nothing but the absence of our own Light; our willingness to hide from it. But it is an absence that behaves curiously like a presence.

[Acts like a force that is devouring Life.]

[It doesn't feel like a foreign entity; it feels like *you.*]

- What about justified contempt for genuinely harmful ideologies?
- Isn't some degree of judgment necessary for moral boundaries?
- How do we distinguish between healthy discernment and malicious contempt?

[In so doing, it has distanced us from our authentic Light, usurping that throne for itself.]

[Any time we feel superior]

We want to make it harder for them to confront their self-deception—because the harder it gets, the more *inherently* evil they appear. That way, the problems of the world will always seem to be caused by something fundamentally alien to us—not just the self-deception we're all familiar with, but true evil—making it easier for us to overlook our *own* contribution to the mess. 

So the goal is to hide our own darkness from ourselves, and the technique is to make it harder for others to confront their own.

But *how* do we reinforce it in others? Simply *intending* to shouldn't be enough—and yet, astonishingly, it is. That's because harboring this dark intent requires *us* to engage in self-deception, which is subconsciously visible to them, thus licensing them to engage in theirs.

Moreover, we must have known this would happen—or else why do it?—and yet hidden it from ourselves, or else it would defeat the whole purpose of making us look good. This is yet another layer of self-deception, which they can also see—and we know that, too. 

The full story involves a recursive paradox that we will unpack later, but in effect, we're sending them a secret message that goes something like this:

> *I can see the Light in you, but I'm pretending not to, so that I can smother it in the name of Good—and I'll get away with it, because there's not a shred of evidence that I'm doing it. But we both know it.*

Meanwhile, here's the story we tell ourselves: we're only flashing them our darkness to show them what we're really capable of if pushed. We're not trying to *reinforce* their evil, but to fight it. And if it *does* reinforce it, well, that only proves how bad they are—a genuine service to the world. It also, incidentally, licenses us to escalate our righteous wrath.

From one perspective, we're subconsciously using our self-deception to hide from ourselves the fact that we are. But from another perspective, *the darkness* is using *us* as vehicles to spread itself, while making us believe that we're the ones in control. We didn't flash them our darkness to make them stop; it flashed itself as a way to awaken theirs.

Think back to a time when you skirted your conscience—acted against your own deepest values while pretending it was okay. In that moment, part of you knew *perfectly well* that you were doing wrong, but you shielded that knowledge from conscious awareness, so that it didn't *feel* wrong. All you could hear were your own clever justifications. Knowledge of your wrongdoing existed in a kind of limbo state, in which you simultaneously *knew* and yet somehow *didn't.*

This state of self-deception has enabled *all the evil there ever was.* Even the worst person can only cause harm by using this same trick to shield themselves from perceiving the life in their victims—that spark that would remind them of themselves. It's not that they lack a conscience—it's that they currently can't hear it.

We all have a conscience. It warns us when our behavior will cause harm—but it can't explain itself, and so we feel safe overriding it.

This is a tragic mistake.

We mock and shame our enemies, knowing *perfectly well* that this will only make them double down and fight back harder, thus increasing the "net animosity" in the world. But our rational mind produces the perfect justification: we're only doing it to prove how evil they are—a genuine service to the world which, incidentally, will license us to escalate.

~~by proving they're beyond redemption, we will be licensed to escalate our righteous wrath, so that we may defeat them once and for all—a genuine service to the world.~~

We *know* this is a self-serving lie, but we don't know *how* we know—and so we pretend that we don't, and that it therefore couldn't possibly affect the outcome.

~~our intention is pure. And even if it's not, how could that matter? Only the *outcome* does—and we just proved it will be a net good.~~

But ironically, this self-deception—this willingness to override our conscience in order to believe what we want—is itself visible to them. It licenses them to ignore theirs, making them seem even more obviously defective. We pretend that we're simply revealing the evil already latent in their minds, but we're actually creating *new* evil—and part of us knows it.

We knew that our deception would invite theirs, even as we did it. We also knew that by hiding this from ourselves—another layer of deception—we could blame it on them. And we knew that they would sense this, too, making them even *more* likely to embrace their own darkness.

The full process involves a recursive paradox that we'll unpack later, but the upshot is that it's not our behavior itself—the mocking or shaming—that caused the harm. It was a subtle signal that we injected into the interaction—one that we hid *even from ourselves*. Roughly speaking, it said: *I am nothing like you.* In so doing, it only proved that we are—which, again, was the point.

This is why "the road to hell is paved with good intentions"—because we're rarely aware of our *true* intentions. We usually become aware of them only long after they've been filtered through our rational minds, by which point they're mangled beyond recognition. We're sure we're doing all the right things, and yet nothing seems to be improving.

But *are* we doing the right things? Or are we just telling ourselves that we are?

Mocking and shaming—and even physical violence—*can* sometimes help. But the truth is that we weren't really trying to help. We were secretly trying to cause harm while appearing helpful. It's difficult to overstate just how many of our actions suffer from this same basic confusion.

The point isn't to shame us for it—or else we'd again be falling into the same trap. Yes, there's a sense in which we knew this, but also a very real sense in which we didn't—that maddening paradox again. And until we get to the root of our own self-deception, we'll forever be confused about the true reason that other people cause harm, and just what we can do about it.

Conversely, the better we get at detecting our own subterfuge, the more ability we have to detect it in others, and thereby help free them from it.

This is how we learn to fight the evil in our world without secretly creating more.

~~It's as though our self-deception spread itself to them, like an infection.~~



Whether we're able to stop them depends entirely on which aspect of their mind we choose to engage.

The more we do this, the less we're able to hear it, until eventually we're completely unaware that such a thing exists in us.

Here's how the story looks from the part of us that *does* know. By harboring contempt, we're secretly signaling:

> *I can see your inner Light—the part of you that exists beneath your self-deception—but I'm pretending not to, so that I can smother it in the name of Good. We both know I'm doing the same thing you are, but I'm going to get away with it while shoving you deeper into the abyss—and there's not a damn thing you can do about it, because there's not a shred of evidence. See? Even my conscious mind doesn't know.*
