## Conscience / limbo state / self-deception

**L0** - I cannot knowingly cause harm without turning away.

**L0** - Your conscience doesn't try to justify itself. The thing producing justifications isn't there to convince it; it's there to convince you that you can't hear it; that it's just one more voice among the noise.

L1 - We don't disobey conscience because of the justifications. We do it because we **choose to follow** the justifications. We don't have to. We follow the ones that give us plausible deniability. That's the origin.

L1 - Doesn't it feel like wise people aren't hiding anything from themselves? The hiding is the revealing.

L1 - Limbo state / self-deception is the secret mechanism behind all evil.

**L1** - There's this subtle sense of getting away with something. I know my plan / agenda / business / ideology is secretly meant to be self-serving, but I can also prove that it will accomplish good. Therefore, it must _be_ good—and if I just suppress knowledge of its true purpose hard enough, that will no longer be its "true" purpose. Like a magic trick, I will hide it from reality (my mind) so well that it magically vanishes. What I can't see is that the self-deception required to maintain this illusion ensures that it will sully the world in exactly the way my conscience warned me would happen if I acted selfishly. I think I'm hiding it from God, but I can't, because God is the thing looking out my eyes, even as I form this ridiculous plan. He was always lurking back there, smiling, not judging.

**L1** - Every time we skirt our conscience, we feel a little thrill—as though we're "pulling a fast one" over the world. But the joke is ultimately on us, because every such act only darkens our reality further—which on one hand, we get to use as justification for even _more_ self-serving behavior, but on the other, inevitably dead-ends in a planet unfit for our survival.

## Contempt

L0: As long as that subtle trace of contempt exists anywhere in my field of experience, directed at anything—and this is often very hard to detect—it means that I'm not actually acting in service to whatever I *think* I am. My actions are subtly degrading the whole, and even worse, they're secretly *meant* to, so that I can justify more subtle contempt.

L1: When I am shoving another person into the dark while trying to look righteous, part of them knows what I'm doing, and I know that, and they know I know that, ad infinitum. That's what makes it so effective. This is called "common knowledge" in game theory. This mutual knowing operated beneath words, yet landed with perfect precision.

**L0** - We make others feel unsafe (through contempt) precisely so they can never look closely enough to see their darkness isn't them. On one level we know we're doing this. On deeper level: it's not "us" doing it—it's the pattern using us.

**L1** - We spread contempt even without direct contact: outrage parties, sharing contemptuous posts. Each raises the background contempt level in the collective field. The darkness doesn't care who you hate, as long as you hate.

**L2** - Most common subtle contempt: being unwilling to truly hear someone's experience. "That person is stupid for feeling that way." Dismissing their inner life as alien shuts down dialogue, keeps both trapped in certainty.

L2:
"But how can something as simple as *contempt* have such a profound effect? After all, it's only conveying:

> *I am inherently superior to you.*

But somehow, what comes across is closer to:

> *See? Even the so-called "good people" are ultimately frauds, and their supposed "Light" a naive myth. When push comes to shove, even they must rely on the real source of power in this world—the darkness. Give up the struggle and join us.*"


**L1** - This mechanism is very difficult to recognize in ourselves, but very easy to see in our enemies. This makes us treat them with contempt, convinced that we're helping the world.


---
## Shielding

L1 - Shielding takes effort to maintain.

**L1** - The progression from shielding to evil: Evil people don't do a *different* thing than the rest of us; they just have a stronger version of the same thing. We instinctively recoil from harming people when we can see their Light. The more we shield ourselves from it, the easier it becomes to cause harm. Shield it completely? The guardrails come off. You would know what it's like to *be evil.*

**L0**: Evil is the *result* of shielding, not its cause. Even if we suspect evil people are just shielding, we still suspect it's because they *are* evil. Beyond a certain point, it starts feeling like the cause.

---
## Calculating your way to goodness

L0 - When you're acting from contempt, notice how *sure* you are it's good.

**L0** - The belief that metrics can tell you whether we're on the right track is the externalization of the belief that thoughts can tell you whether you're doing good.

L0: If there were really an inner Light, we'd be able to prove it, right? And since we can't prove it, there's no point looking for it.

**L0** - The crucial thing is to stay aligned with your heart. Find that part of you that longs for nothing more than to be of service to all of Life. You can feel it when you're connected to it. That slowly devolves into an *idea* of serving life ("oh, the best way to serve Life is to violently murder XYZ, and here's a proof.") The feeling of "righteous" transforms beneath your notice.

L1 - "I'll just try to be a better person" doesn't work (because "good person" is an idea. See moral escape hatch. Also, the parasite lies dormant.)

L1: The Moral Escape Hatch: We like to think rules and moral systems exist to make us good people—but we actually build them to offload our moral responsibility. It’s easier to follow a rule than to stay fully aware in the moment. Rules let us say “I did the right thing” without feeling the full weight of conscience. Real conscience isn’t a list of dos and don’ts. It’s full, unflinching awareness. It's refusing to escape into limbo. It demands that we see everything we’re doing, everything it touches, and act honestly from that seeing. That’s hard. It hurts. So we build moral systems to take the edge off. They let us feel righteous while keeping us half-asleep. That is why genuine goodness cannot be formalized."

**L1** - Good and evil _cannot_ be formalized. Any attempt to do so is only your mind trying to squirm out of its responsibility to be deeply sensitive to what your present situation requires of you. Your ideologies can serve as guidelines, but nothing more.

**L1** - If you really want to know whether your behavior is good or evil, you must turn to a place that's deeper than thought; a place that can never be hijacked. There is a part of you that knows when you're lying to yourself. It sees how this will darken the world even when there's no objective evidence; even when no one is watching. Modern society fetishizes thinking and rationality precisely because they enable us to overlook this part, relegating it to the spiritual or mystical. Organized religion, on the other hand, instructs us to rely on an external authority for the same reason. Both give rise to a massive blind spot that allows our darkness to thrive.

**L1** - If you want to know whether you're really doing good, the first thing you must learn to check is whether you're deceiving yourself in some way. It is by far our most common mode of operation. Calculations can obviously be helpful, but only if they're in service of our Light. They must come "after" (not temporally after, necessarily.)

**L1** - If you have some grand narrative about how to save the world, it's crucial to check whether it's causing (or even requiring!) you to have contempt for what's right here, right now. If so, it probably isn't rooted in authentic goodness, and probably won't have the effect you think (or can even prove!) it will. A common example of this is "I'll hoard as much wealth and resources as possible so that I can one day deploy it in service of good." (see: FTX). Or eugenics projects. Maybe give other examples.

**L2** - One of the key insights that kicked off this whole work for me was that when we go into work, we're usually lying to ourselves about how it's going to impact the world. Either it's really to enrich us or we are caught in the materialism trap etc. And so the most important thing we can bring to our work is our connection to the light. And not just work, all of life. The most important thing we can offer the world is our connection to our light, our integrity. If we're trying to follow our thoughts to tell us what the impact of our behavior will be, we're probably lost.

---
## Parasite

L1 - Identifying it as a parasite is what releases the shame that was preventing me from looking directly at it.

**L1**: The parasite's job is to make us confuse the person with their darkness. This alone ensures we will strengthen it.

---
## Devil / conspiracy

**L1** - The line between those who deserve our compassion and those who deserve our contempt exists only for the Devil to keep its foot in the door.

**L0** - Our parasites aren't fighting—they're collaborating. My darkness gives theirs evidence they're persecuted; their darkness gives mine evidence they're irredeemable. Both avoid looking at own darkness while feeling righteous. Perfect closed loop. Secret alliance beneath conscious awareness.

**L1** - The background hum of casual cruelty: The darkness doesn't just spread through dramatic confrontations. It spreads through the constant background hum of casual contempt—YouTube comments, Reddit threads, Twitter pile-ons, Facebook snark. "Darwin award," "FAFO," "play stupid games" etc. Each instance seems tiny, meaningless, but they're cumulative. They act like radiation, creating an atmosphere where everyone's baseline cynicism rises slightly, where everyone's default assumption about strangers becomes darker. This is what feeds the great evils. The oil executive making his harmful choice, the politician telling her lie—they're swimming in this sea of casual cruelty. It's made the world just dark enough that their self-deception becomes easier to justify. Every contemptuous comment you don't make turns down the volume on that hum, making the atmosphere less hospitable for darkness to spread.

**L1** - two actions can be made to look nearly-identical on the outside and yet produce drastically different long-term effects.

L1: The devil is in the details. How nearly any agenda (e.g., political) can be implemented with compassion or contempt. How people can sense what the intention of the originator is, and how it influences their implementation. Thus how it can create great harm or great good. But people are too busy arguing about the outward, overt goals (the provable stuff).

---
## Evil people

**L1** - "Bad people" are just those on whom we feel righteous unleashing our darkness.

**L2** - Part of me is constantly SENSING who it's "okay" to push how hard. The "evil" line is when I realize I can go completely dark on them myself. This makes "evil people" humanity's collective dumping ground—where we can all unleash without guilt. We actually deliver this message to them when hating them: "sorry, someone has to be the fall guy here. And if I trap you in the abyss, I will know that my darkness is safe."

---
## Compassion / The Light

**L1** - Directly perceiving the full interconnectedness and "oneness" of reality is what contemplative traditions would call enlightenment, but all of us can taste it to some degree or another long before then. That's why literature like the following speaks to us so powerfully. It is also why we sometimes thank people for acts of charity that don't seem to benefit us directly. We can sense that whatever happens to the world ultimately happens to us.

L1: the Dalai Lama says if someone's trying to shoot you and you have a gun, shoot back—but never out of malice.

L1: It is not until you realize just how badly you've been fooled that you begin to appreciate what is going on in the minds of the "bad people" — and thereby become able to combat it.

**L0** - A major punchline: goodness is simply what remains in the absence of self-deception, not something you have to add. (The classic angel and devil on shoulders is almost correct, but the angel is actually your true nature and the devil is your capacity for self-deception—a parasite that can be evicted. They are not equals.)

**L2** - Realizing this in its entirety is known as _enlightenment_, but all of us can sense it to some degree or another at all times. It is only by turning away from this ultimate truth that we are able to feel contempt, and thereby willingly cause harm.

**L2** - We lost contact with our absolute goodness, and so we went out searching for our goodness relatively — that is, by making other people bad. How ironic that our faint memory of our goodness ended up causing so much harm.

**L2** - At the ultimate level, we find that there _are_ no "others." This is the hardest level to describe, being what spiritual traditions call "enlightenment." Reality itself is a radiant singularity, whose essential nature is something like infinite Love. Again, this is not something soft and mushy—or at least, not _only_ those things. It is beyond all mental categories, and yet we recognize it as the ultimate source of our heroic capacity to defend Life and the innocent at any cost. That is what you most ultimately _are._

**L0** - The very definition of good is that which brings us all closer to remembering our common true nature, and that can only be done by remembering yours. Evil is the opposite of this. That is why it is often said that the greatest gift you can give to the world is your own Awakening. Until then, some part of you will always be reinforcing evil, even as another part is confident that you're fighting it. It is completely inevitable.

**L1** - At the very deepest level, you _are_ the Light. So is everybody else. In fact, you _are_ everybody and everything else, just pretending that you're not. One consciousness, dreaming countless perspectives.

**L1** - What you ultimately are is a Light so vast that it defies description; a profound Love for all of reality that excludes nothing and forsakes no-one — including the targets of its fearsome wrath, should that be necessary.

**L0** - The big reveal was: "Oh, this is not me!" It was layers of pain and confusion that had agglomerated into a complex (in the Jungian sense?). I was shown what I was when that complex lifted (which felt like being freed of a demonic possession). There was no mistaking the fact that the complex was extrinsic to my mind, whereas the Light underneath it was intrinsic. In fact, not just intrinsic, but somehow what I actually _was_. That Light is completely featureless (though its true nature is Love). Then: "Oh, this is not him either!" It cannot possibly be someone's true self. Malice is not inherent to the nature of mind—just like the Buddhists say.

**L3** - Notice how the word "right" is a synonym for both "good" and "correct." This is not an accident: something in you knows that what is good is what is most correct.

**L0** - Compassion being weak is only a lie that the darkness tells to prevent us from recognizing the true power of our Light.

**L0** - Counterintuitive: you can lift people up even as you viciously combat their evil.

**L2** - It has become a common trope that we are how the Universe looks at itself. But what if it were possible to know this not as a mere concept, but as a direct experiential realization? You would feel the visceral impact of knowing that all of it is ultimately different parts of You.

---

L1 - Thus what I had wasn't real darkness, but only the strategic kind—the kind that all good people must harbor to keep real evil in check. What a crock.

## NEW FRAMING DEVICES

**L1** - The "three strikes" mechanism

**L1** - When on the receiving end of contempt, you can tell they're not coming from a good place. How?

L0: On one level, we're fighting. On the second level, my darkness is provoking yours. Third level: oh shit, they're using us!

## CONTENT NOTES

**L2** - "At the very ultimate level, there is nothing special about any one of us—no cleanliness of soul—that would have ensured we would turn out differently. We simply haven't been subjected to the same forces. And even this knowledge—'I could have been them'—must be held carefully, because it can become another form of self-righteousness ('Look how humble I am for recognizing this')."

L1: "The things you do when nobody's watching—they don't fail to matter." (What other deep truths do people feel? Which ones are hopeful? This one is validated by showing that our inner knowing is reliable.)

L1: You can only choose the false one by forgetting what the real one is like. Exactly like how people can only choose junk food by never having been offered real food, porn over intimacy, etc.

L2: Have you ever felt gratitude when someone helps strangers you'll never meet or donates to charities you'll never benefit from directly? There's a reason for that.


### Need to be placed into the doc somewhere:

**L0** - I could only see my darkness clearly because the medicine held me in the Light while revealing it. When darkness is exposed non-lovingly, we feel threatened and can't look. When held in unconditional Love, we can see: it's not even part of me—it's completely extrinsic. This is the only way the parasite can be evicted.

**L1** - When we see darkness in the world, we use it to justify our own ("I've been hurt, so I'm licensed"). Then feel guilty, so never look closely enough to see it's not us. The darkness wants to stay in limbo.


**L0** - Fourth wall: "The knowledge had never been absent. Not in me. And not in you, reading this right now." You already know this—you've felt it when thanking people for charity that won't benefit you, when stories like The Egg resonate.

**L1** - You were not looking at an enemy. The Light was only ever looking at the Light. It can never actually forget itself, only pretend to. That's why part of you knows it's phony when you claim others are nothing like you. The message contains seeds of its own failure.

## META-POINTS

- We try to expose people's darkness violently. The way that works is compassionately (though not nicely). That's what the trip did for me—it was fierce and unrelenting, but always cradled it within the context of the Light. That's what this essay is attempting to do for the reader. Maybe even make this point explicit?
    
- An ironic trap I fall into a lot: contempt for people who still express contempt / haven't seen through it.
    
- Tools for working through it (shadow work, meditation, psychedelics, etc.). It's nowhere near as simple as "I read it, I got it." There are levels and levels and levels...
    
- The shift in mindset: we are rescuing people (badly confused versions of ourselves?) from our primordial nemesis.

**L1**: We shave off a little or there for ourselves, telling ourselves we deserve it, and that it's not nearly as awful as what the "bad people" do—but we *know* it will subtly darken the world further, which we want, because it will give cover to our own. We tell ourselves it won't matter in the grand scheme of things, but part of us knows it's contributing to the degradation of the social fabric.

**L1**: It's ultimately not possible to hide anything, so why try?

**L3**: Normally, we have an aversion to harming people because we perceive their innocence—their Light—and instinctively recoil from the thought of extinguishing it. But if they have no such Light? The guardrails come off—and this comes across in our behavior via countless subtle tells, whether we're aware of it or not. We give people the benefit of the doubt until they cross a particular line, then we see them as evil, and at that point not just our strategy changes, but we realize we can pull of this ruse.

**L1**: This is why it is worth staying committed to our light at literally any cost. Not just our idea of the light, which are always sullied by self-deception. It is the ONLY thing that moves this whole thing in the direction we most deeply desire.

L1: In one sentence: darkness perpetuates itself by pretending to fight itself.



**L1**: This is why, if you want to end evil, it is necessary and sufficient to end the limbo state in humanity—and the only way to help with that is to end it in yourself. Otherwise, part of you will always be secretly reinforcing it in others. Now listen for some part of you is fearful: "what if, underneath the self-deception, some people (maybe even me) might STILL do the wrong thing." That fear exists ONLY to give that part of you an excuse to push others deeper in; for your own darkness to continue hiding.

L1: The purpose of conveying "I am nothing like you" is to increase that perception in the Whole, which we do because it is too painful to confront that what lives in you does, indeed, live in me.

---
## 2. SELF-DECEPTION AS THE CORE MECHANISM

**L1** - We like to believe that our innermost intentions have no effect on the world; that they remain confined to our skulls, and only our actions have consequences — but this is precisely how our darkness gets us to look away for long enough to infuse itself _into_ those very actions, thereby escaping our skulls and weaving itself into the fabric of our reality. A deep part of us knows when our actions are not fully aligned with the Light, but with our own self-interest instead. This knowledge subtly taints those actions, so that even the most noble-sounding project only induces more self-serving behavior in everyone it touches, even as they're convinced that they're doing good.



**L1** - We are all intimately connected in a way that transcends all attempts to describe it. We have relegated this truth to the "spiritual," where we can safely lock it away—because we know that if we opened that box, we would be forced to confront our own profound complicity in the world's ills. Every act of conscience-skirting and every unkindness we have ever perpetrated on _anyone_ still remains "out there," waiting patiently for us to clean it up. The atrocities we see halfway across the globe are not disconnected from us, like we imagine; nor are they excuses to pump even _more_ darkness in the world in the form of contempt for their perpetrators.

**L1** - We like to believe that the things we do when nobody is watching don't matter; that our intentions are irrelevant. That they remain confined to our minds...

**L1** - On the contrary, every bit of darkness we see in the world is an invitation for us to clean up the darkness in ourselves. This is completely counterintuitive, which is why it's so hard to figure out—but when we finally do, something astonishing happens. We begin to perceive the _reasons_ that other people are unable to give up their own darkness; and rather than make the horrifying mistake of shoving them deeper into the abyss for it, we start to sense our role in pulling them _out_ of it.


**L2** - How much harm we're able to inject into the world via subtle channels.

**L2** - How many things we believe only because they secretly serve us in some way.

**L2** - It's difficult to overstate how much of our behavior is secretly self-serving. How easy and natural-feeling it is to lie to ourselves about our true intentions.

**L1** - The reason the road to hell is paved with good intentions is that we're rarely aware of our _true_ intentions.

**L2** - The vast majority of human activity takes place beneath our conscious thresholds.

**L2** - We overlook the self-deception in people whose own hidden agendas align with our own, and exaggerate it in those whose are anti-aligned.

**L2** - Suppose a politician says we should go to war with country X to save their people or bring them democracy or whatever. In the back of their mind, suppose their primary goal is actually to get oil, or get re-elected, or whatever — knowing fully well that it will bring great harm not only to the country's citizens, but to the world at large. But the knowledge of this deception can be hidden even from their own conscious minds. In one sense, they're not "bad people," because they "really are" trying to help — as far as they can tell. And yet, part of them secretly knows, and — surprisingly — it is possible to tell this from the outside. It can never be completely hidden.

**L2** - This capacity for self-deception exists in everyone, but along a continuum. The further along it they are (and the smarter they are), the better they are able to hide it behind agendas that look exciting and helpful and shiny from the outside, but are secretly rotten from the inside — eating away at the world in ways that can be hard to detect until it's too late.

**L2** - The more free your own mind is from self-deception, the better you get at detecting it in others, and the less you fall for this trap. Now of course everybody believes that they're free of it, and this is something only "bad people" do — because by its very nature, it's not something we can (normally) perceive in ourselves. But it turns out that this belief is _itself_ the surest sign that it's operating in us.

**L1** - The Darkness _needs_ us to believe this, because then it can execute its most insidious operation: it gets us to behave in subtly dark ways — such as maliciously mocking and shaming our enemies — that actually drive the darkness deeper _into_ their minds while convincing us that there was no malice involved; or, even if there was, that it's for the greater good. But part of us secretly knows the truth, and we lock this truth away in a hidden compartment in our minds.

**L2** - But there can come a turning point in life where the whole storehouse of self-deception is unveiled, and we see how much harm it has caused. It is impossibly painful. After this, you don't magically become a "good person," but your own self-deception actually becomes painful, so that you're forced to acknowledge it when it arises, and to clean it up bit by bit.

**L3** - How could there be a part of you that knows when your behavior will darken the world, when you yourself can prove otherwise? There couldn't—and you can _prove_ it!

**L3** - Part of them knows _perfectly well_ that they are doing wrong, but the full implications of their behavior are carefully shielded from conscious self-reflection.

**L0** - This is why our culture fetishizes rationality and intellect above all else: those aspect of mind are fundamentally incapable of detecting the spreading infection until _after_ it has physically manifested, by which point it is too late. We trust our thinking minds to tell us when they're lying to us, and then use more thoughts to prove that thinking is all we have. If there really were an "inner Light," we would be able to prove it; and since we can't, there's no point in looking for it.

**L1** - It is astonishingly easy to prove _beyond any doubt_ that an agenda, philosophy, or ideology is good—to marshal all the evidence, convince brilliant minds—only to watch it wreak havoc. When the damage is done (often after we've profited), we look back and say: "How were we supposed to know?" But we _could_ have known, if only we'd looked at what we were hiding from ourselves instead of trusting our calculations.

**L2** - We often feel that an action serves a dual purpose: helping ourselves while also genuinely helping the world. We can even feel the balance: "Yes, this benefits me, but it _also_ helps others!" This always feels like a comfortable compromise. But a deeper part of us knows this is a lie—that the "helping the world" part is a fig leaf for what we're really doing (serving ourselves), with the world's benefit being secondary at best, and often pure fiction.

**L2** - How much of our behavior is secretly self-serving (requiring us to hide this fact from ourselves): our grand visions, agendas, philosophies, morality, ideologies. The most noble-sounding agenda can lead to catastrophe precisely because it's rooted in self-deception. We trust our intellect's calculations about how it will help the world, and that trust is exactly the problem—our intellect is the very thing providing justifications to avoid looking at what we already know.

**L0** - It is impossible to communicate just how subtle our contempt can be while still accomplishing its dark mission.

**L1** - One subtle form of contempt: being unwilling to hear someone else's experience.

**L0** - We think of contempt as an emotion—something we feel toward specific people who've done specific things. But the pattern operates at a much deeper level than that. **Simply by _perceiving reality as an intrinsically lifeless collection of "stuff" over which humanity has dominion_, we unwittingly reinforce every system of exploitation and destruction on Earth.** This is not a small point. This may be _the_ point. Our entire modern worldview—the one we consider enlightened, rational, scientific—rests on a foundational contempt so deep we don't even recognize it as contempt. We see the world as dead matter. Resources to extract. Objects to manipulate. A mechanical universe of purposeless atoms following meaningless laws.

## 3. THE NATURE OF THE PARASITE/DARKNESS


**L0** - Indeed, all the darkness in the world is conspiring; together behaving like a *singular distributed malevolent entity*, manipulating all of humanity from beneath our conscious thresholds. The Christians call it the Devil, and the Buddhists know it as the Ego. It is the *primordial* evil conspiracy; the one to which all the rest owe their existence, and to which they ultimately filter up. Every attempt to destroy it without being free of it ourselves only ends up reinforcing it, because that confused impulse is only ever generated *by* it. It is an *impossibly* clever trap.

**L0** - The shadow feeds on our pain, confusion, insecurity.

**L1** - The darkness is caused by a kind of parasite in the mind — but yours and mine aren't truly separate.

**L1** - When we do, something astonishing happens. We discover that this capacity for self-deception is caused by a kind of mental parasite. While we were under its sway, it felt like it _was_ us. We _wanted_ to shove other people into the abyss, and it felt impossibly righteous to do so. But now we see that this was only ever the parasite cleverly masquerading _as_ us. It fed on our weaknesses, exploiting our fear and pride, enabling us to engage in myriad self-serving behaviors that we couldn't recognize as such, and that we would never tolerate in our enemies.

**L1** - It does this by hiding itself perfectly from our own minds—so that we don't realize we're infected—while making us perceive it as _intrinsic_ to others, so that we see them as inherently evil. We don't recognize that they're under the sway of a parasite that we ourselves share. It manipulates our perception at such a fundamental level that we cannot even fathom that we're being fooled. We're certain we're seeing the truth—and anyone who sees it otherwise must be crazy, stupid, or evil themselves. This makes us feel morally compelled to shove them deeper into its malevolent clutches, convinced we're helping.

**L1** - The darkness does not ultimately have its own existence; it is merely our willingness to look away from our inner Light for long enough to be distracted by a counterfeit, which we then take as our new North Star. The longer we follow it, the less we are able to tell the two apart — until finally, they are indistinguishable. It is not that they look at all the same; it is that we have been lured into a trance. We have completely forgotten that there _was_ (and still is) a blazing Light whose authority is completely beyond question.

**L1** - It is by looking away from our Light that the darkness creeps in. Indeed, the darkness is _nothing but_ our willingness to look away. The result of this decision is **always** evil, and yet the _decision itself_ is not evil. It is a form of profound confusion. Your decision to hate bad people is not evil, but any action you take from this place _will_ darken the world, one way or another, without your conscious knowledge.

**L1** - It keeps our attention fixated perpetually outward, on the evil "out there," to prevent us from looking closely enough "in here," at the one place where we can actually defeat it, and thereby be of genuine service to others. Every act of unkindness we have ever perpetrated on _anyone_ has secretly been in its service — and part of us has always known this.

L1 - Doesn't just whisper ideas in your ear; it alters your very perception of reality.

**L1** - All the casual cruelty we see around us (Facebook, Youtube comments, etc.) is the "background hum" that feeds the great evils, keeping them alive.

**L2** - It doesn't feel like a foreign entity; it feels like _you._

**L2** - It acts like a force that is devouring Life.

**L2** - But this knowledge rarely reaches conscious awareness. We only hear the part of our mind that cleverly calculates how our behavior was a net good. The knowledge of our darkness exists in a kind of limbo state, but we _can_ learn to become fully conscious of it. When we do, something astonishing happens.

**L2** - The deeper our infection, the more situations there seem to be in which unkindness is justified or even righteous — yet we become increasingly unable to recognize that we're being manipulated. We progressively confuse the darkness for our inner Light, not realizing that we're following a counterfeit. Eventually, it completely usurps the throne.

**L3** - In this shadowy state, we license ourselves to get away with things that we otherwise could not — and that we would never tolerate in our enemies.

**L0** - There are layers to how the darkness operates: (1) Surface level: I think I have no darkness. (2) Partial awareness: I'm hiding my darkness from myself because it's too horrible to face (I catch glimpses, but think I'm using it strategically to fight evil). (3) The deepest trap: The darkness is convincing me it's too horrible to face—making me believe I may be inherently defective (just look at how evil my message is!)—so that I will hide it from myself. And it knows that this will cause me to spread it to others. **It's using me as a vehicle to spread itself!** The way it prevents me from noticing (3) is by giving me partial access to (2)—letting me think _I'm_ the one using _it_ strategically. The only resolution is to see (4): I am pure Light at my core, and the darkness is not intrinsic to me.

## 4. THE NATURE OF EVIL AND "BAD PEOPLE"

**L0** - At the very deepest level, nobody could possibly want it. Yet the more deeply it has ensnared their minds, the less able they are to recognize it. The only reason we perceive evil as being _intrinsic_ to their minds is because our own parasite has ensnared _us._ Its whole trick is to alter our perception at such a deep level that certain people appear _fundamentally defective_, thus making contempt feel not only justified, but positively righteous.

**L0** - The only reason we perceive evil as _intrinsic_ to other minds is so that we will feel morally licensed to viciously attack them for it.

**L0** - As long as we feel like "good people," we believe in the existence of inherently "bad people," which justifies us harboring contempt somewhere in our minds. This is how the darkness keeps its foot in the door.

**L1** - You simply cannot fathom the full extent of pain and distortion that the Light must undergo in order to become "evil." Your heart would break a billion times over, and then a billion more. By the time a person becomes someone who apparently chooses evil, an unthinkable amount of horror has already ravaged their mindstream. None of this is to suggest that we should feel _sympathy_ for them, because by this point, softness would indeed make things worse, both for them and others. But if you really saw it all, you could never again feel that malicious urge to shove them deeper into the abyss. You would immediately recognize it as the very essence of evil. At the very ultimate level, there is nothing special about any one of us — no cleanliness of soul — that would have ensured we would turn out differently. Seeing this, one truly understands "there but for the grace of God go I."

**L1** - The way evil works is by making us _perceive_ it as intrinsic...

**L1** - Therefore, if you want to defeat evil, you must end humanity's capacity for self-deception. And that's only possible to the degree you've overcome your own.

**L1** - If you really wish to defeat evil instead of mindlessly adding more to the world, you must develop the capacity to perceive — not just believe, but perceive — that evil is not intrinsic to any mind.

**L1** - The deepest part of us knows that we're not intrinsically superior to anyone — including the "bad people" — but our self-deceptive capacity tricks us into believing that we are.

**L1** - The deepest part of us _knows_ that we are not intrinsically superior to anyone, including the "bad people" — and that nothing positive is gained by pretending that we are. Again, this has nothing to do with tolerating their behavior, and everything to do with seeing how our own darkness manipulates us in precisely the same way that theirs does them.

**L2** - The truth is, every misbehavior, from the slightest skirting of conscience to the most horrific war crime, is enabled by precisely the same mechanism — and every time anyone engages in it for any reason whatsoever, they induce the same tendency in others.

**L2** - This is where the "bad people" are trapped — and our desire to contemptuously judge them for it is nothing but our own parasite seducing us. Its whole trick is to make us feel _intrinsically_ superior to others, so that it feels deliciously righteous to shove them deeper into the abyss. We don't recognize that they're in the grips of a parasite, and that we're shoving them deeper into its clutches.

**L2** - The darkness that exists in them exists within us, too, even if it feeds on a different set of psychological motivations. Theirs may be related to money or power, while ours is simply about the need to feel like "good people." Yet no matter how seemingly-innocent our motivation, the net effect is ultimately the same. By engaging in **any** form of self-deception, we induce the same tendency in others. It is _infectious_.

**L3** - We don't see what vengeance and cruelty really are.

**L3** - Forsaking others only ever forsakes yourself.

**L3** - Looking at precisely the same entity...

## 5. CONTEMPT AND ITS EFFECTS

**L0** - My contempt was, in a sense, trying to make them forget our fundamental connection—to push them deeper into the illusion of separation. And because this worked—because contempt does make people forget, does drive them deeper into isolation—it became a self-fulfilling prophecy. They became more trapped, more "evil," which then proved I'd been right about them all along.

**L0** - Seeing that my hatred shoved people deeper in (and that I knew it) was extremely painful.

**L0** - Contempt = trying to make you forget that we are One, and as a result, you do, which explains why you become more evil. My desire to create more separation is a self-fulfilling prophecy.

**L0** - We don't mock and shame our enemies _despite_ it making them dig in their heels, but _because_ of it. If you look carefully enough into your mind in that moment, here's what you will find: something in you _wants_ to flash your capacity for darkness to your enemies, hoping that it will subdue theirs.

**L1** - "Contempt is an _unloving_ way of exposing the truth. It feels like coercion, not invitation. To preserve dignity, they run into denial, which means deeper darkness."

**L1** - When we contemptuously judge our enemies, it may feel like we're rubbing their noses in their _badness_ so that they will be forced to confront it (and then when they don't, we assume it's because they're bad), but we're actually trying to make it harder to confront.

**L1** - By making us perceive certain people as _fundamentally defective_ — in other words, with contempt — it secretly telegraphs our own self-deception to them. This causes them to perceive _us_ as defective, making them feel more justified in their misbehavior, which proves to us that they are indeed defective. This _increases_ the self-deception in the world.

**L1** - Contempt is the secret handshake our parasites use to provoke each other while making us feel noble for doing so.

**L1** - There is a part of us that would rather see our enemies remain in delusion than be healed, so that we can justify our anger and hierarchy of blame. So it does something fiendishly clever: it dehumanizes them, inviting them to see _us_ as evil, in hopes of getting them to overstep their moral bounds, thus proving us right. They see this as evil _because it is_. This is _why_ they are overstepping their moral bounds. We _know_ that people license themselves to do this when confronted with evil, because it is what we are doing _right now_. But we must never admit this, even to ourselves.

**L2** - But another part knows that this is a sham: it's not actually meant to _suppress_ their darkness, but to _provoke_ it in a way that will force you to unleash more righteous fury.

**L2** - This knowledge exists in a kind of limbo state. On one level, it feels completely noble: you're not _provoking_ their darkness, but merely exposing it for the world to see. Besides, cruelty _can_ suppress other people's misbehavior — at least, their _public_ misbehavior, and for a time. Thus, we easily convince ourselves that it "works." But another part of you secretly knows that it will only _increase_ the net darkness in the world.

**L2** - This has the effect of driving their darkness deeper into their minds, making it appear even more surely intrinsic, which inspires even more righteous violence from us, in a downward spiral. We act dismayed by their recalcitrance, but our darkness actually orchestrated this descent.

**L2** - Something in you wants them to become worse people so that you can be right about them.

**L2** - It is impossible to communicate just how subtle our contempt can be while still accomplishing its dark mission. Simply by _perceiving reality as an intrinsically lifeless collection of "stuff" over which humanity has dominion_, we unwittingly reinforce the systems that permit corporations to plunder nature for profit; factory farms to brutalize helpless creatures; prisons to dehumanize inmates in ways that guarantee recidivism; and governments to send our young off to wars that only enrich the pockets of the rich. All of this and more is the _inevitable result_ of a broken worldview that blinds us to the infinite beauty of life, reducing it to mere stuff to be exploited—in other words, that encourages a subtle contempt for _reality as a whole_.

**L1** - Look of compassion, malevolence, and looking at others like NPCs (which is actually a mild contempt).

**L3** - The desire to shove others into the abyss only makes them _embrace_ their captor, and part of you know this. The deeper into delusion we go, the more certain we are that we're seeing clearly.

**L3** - Oh yeah, in addition to "how can we have common knowledge with complete strangers": "why does contempt land so deep?" It's a threat to an extremely deep level of mind. What does that level of mind know that we may not consciously? (Find ways to better word this that will evoke their recognition even before I point it out.)

---

## 6. ANGER VS CONTEMPT / JUDGMENT

**L1** - Anger is a completely natural, and even healthy, response to such misbehavior. But it is almost always accompanied by malice, contempt, or self-righteousness. These may feel healthy, too, but they are only manifestations of our parasite.

**L1** - The darkness tricks us into closing our hearts precisely when they are needed the most.

**L1** - If judgment means wise discernment, it's helpful. It's contemptuous judgment that's the problem. Same with outrage. At one level these are easy to confuse, but at a deeper level the distinction is obvious. It's only our darkness that makes it feel hard.

**L2** - We therefore allocate more of our attention to _their_ unmistakable evil and less to what is occurring inside us.

**L3** - Anger vs contempt; contempt for behaviors and beliefs.

---

## 7. HOW DARKNESS SPREADS (Collective Dynamics)

**L0** - The darkest idea of all is that if we were to round up all the "bad people" and exterminate them, the rest of us would live in harmony. The very self-deception required to harbor this thought guarantees that the darkness would remain behind, in full force; changing only its shape. The very desire to divide the world into the fundamentally good and bad; those who deserve our compassion and those who deserve our contempt, is how our darkness keeps its foot in the door, biding its time, waiting for the right conditions, so that it may manifest as full-blown evil. This is the root cause of every atrocity that has ever been committed.

**L0** - On the surface, we and they may be enemies, but under the covers, our darkness is secretly allied. This is the trick by which the darkness spreads nearly unchecked, getting each of us to strengthen it while flawlessly convinced that we're fighting it. And the darker the world becomes, the harder it gets to see that this is what we're actually doing.

**L0** - It is only by seeing how thoroughly we—the "good people"—been tricked that we begin to appreciate just how terrifyingly clever the darkness is, just how deeply the "bad people" are trapped, and our profound responsibility in "saving" them.

**L1** - The more we forget this, the more we feel like fundamentally separate beings at constant war with intrinsically defective "others." From this confused perspective, we are capable only of spreading more confusion, while feeling flawlessly convinced that we are "fighting evil." The more people fall victim to this darkness, the more we as a society believe its lies — that humans are _fundamentally_ selfish and greedy, and that some people must be forsaken for the benefit of all. By believing these dark lies, we license our own darkness to keep operating, mistaking it for our inner Light, not recognizing it as a counterfeit merely pretending to _be_ us.

**L1** - It is precisely the same trick that has enabled every atrocity ever committed. Every time any one of us accedes to this misperception — no matter who our target is — we reinforce the same tendency in others. This is how the darkness spreads without anyone being aware of their own complicity.

**L1** - It is said that "the elites" are playing us regular folks against each other to take our attention off of them, but the darkness is playing a much bigger game. It doesn't care _who_ we hate, as long as we hate. The effect is always the same: to foment a constant atmosphere of contempt, providing exactly the cover it needs to remain hidden in the shadows.

**L1** - It continually drives humanity toward various kinds of Armageddon: situations in which everyone is violently proving how _righteous_ they are. It is why the US is headed toward civil war without anyone suspecting their own complicity, and explains bitter [divorces](https://www.gottman.com/blog/this-one-thing-is-the-biggest-predictor-of-divorce/) in which each side feels like the exclusive victim / hero. Nearly the whole world is caught in its terrible sway, evil provoking "righteous" retribution at every turn, without anyone ever noticing the true source of it all.

**L1** - This is why it's impossible to fight darkness with darkness: darkness never actually _tries_ to fight itself; it is only ever on its own team, and all it has to do to win is convince us to use it as a tool to further our supposedly noble agendas.

**L1** - The deeper we go into this realization, the more our standard view of reality begins to fall apart—but not in a bad way. We discover our profound and surprising inseparability with others, and with the world itself. We see _why_ we could never "pull a fast one" over the world: because ultimately, we _are_ the world. Exploiting nature cannot possibly work, no matter how cleverly it is done, because we _are_ nature. The only way we can exploit anything or anyone is by hiding knowledge of the truth from ourselves—and this act of hiding is _itself_ what darkens our reality.

**L2** - The more darkness there is "out there," the more justified every one of us feels in acting selfishly. Yet it never feels selfish; it just feels like what we _must_ do. The self-serving aspects of our own agendas and behaviors become much harder to consciously recognize in this state, while those of others become _easier_ to see. This is not an accident. The way the darkness works is by cleverly hiding itself from our own minds while loudly announcing it to others, so that each of us is flawlessly convinced that we're fighting evil while we're really just strengthening it.

**L2** - Going forward, you will be less likely to notice the insidious presence of darkness in your own mind, as you grow increasingly obsessed with the "real threat" out there. You will justify more self-serving behaviors of your own without any awareness that you're doing so, because they will seem _irrefutably necessary_. The darkness has hijacked not only your perception—making others appear evil—but your _entire cognitive apparatus_, preventing you from even suspecting that you're being manipulated. You believe you are _helping_.

**L2** - We lie to ourselves in a million tiny ways all the time; our mind angling to gain subtle advantages for ourselves, but of course never letting us know that it is doing so. Our unconscious desires weave themselves into the very fabric of our reality, manipulating it in nearly-visible ways that supposedly benefit us while gradually degrading the whole. Yet degrading the whole can never ultimately benefit us — a fact that we are slowly waking up to as a species. We are aware that "bad people" are destroying our very biosphere to line their own pockets, but we haven't yet made the connection between our own behavior and theirs. We still believe that our hatred for them is a sign of the good within us, but only because we are still not looking too carefully.

**L0** - The devastation we see in the world is literally a mirror image of the sickness within. The collapse of the biosphere IS our self-deception externalized.

**L1** - It is a Faustian bargain: our agendas get furthered while the darkness gets a tighter grip on the world.

---

## 8. THE FEELING OF RIGHTEOUSNESS

**L0** - The feeling of being the noble one fighting the evil conspiracy IS the conspiracy. When you are _actually_ fighting it, it doesn't feel like fighting; it feels like profound love; like rescuing people from the darkness that they unwittingly harbor — even when it is entirely "witting."

**L0** - "One thing Charles has done a good job of explaining — but which people somehow don't yet see -- is that the contempt we feel for the evil people out there is a symptom of our own evil. He's not just trying to get people to be nice by saying this. It really is the truth. Evil is insanely clever, and its most brilliant trick is to convince you that it doesn't live in your own mind. If you really want to defeat evil instead of mindlessly adding more to the world, you must develop the capacity to perceive -- not just believe, but perceive -- that evil is not intrinsic to any mind. It's a parasite, and like any parasite, it can be destroyed. Wanting to destroy the host only strengthens the parasite. That's what genuine "spiritual warfare" is about: freeing minds from the parasite of evil, without being taken in by its illusion."

**L1** - It is a story as old as humanity itself, and the only reason it persists is that we have told ourselves that we are uniquely immune. We could never be _those people_ — after all, look at how much we hate and judge them. But the truth is that as long as we endorse any distinction whatsoever between _fundamentally good_ and _fundamentally bad_ people; those who deserve our compassion and those who deserve only contempt, it means that we are _already_ those people in fledgling form. For we do not yet recognize that this distinction exists _only_ as a way for our darkness to keep its foot in the door, waiting for the right conditions, to manifest in its full sinister glory. We may believe that we can maintain a "proper balance," reserving our spite for those who genuinely deserve it — but if so, it only means that we're not yet aware of just how much damage we're already doing. This only proves that we are _especially_ susceptible.

**L2** - That's why revenge fantasy films like _The Equalizer_ are so popular: they exist only to keep us firmly ensconced in this warm delusion where we are the immaculate "good guys" fighting the hordes of pure evil "out there." Think of them as physical manifestations of our collective shadow.

**L3** - Ironically, the only people who _are_ superior — and thus have any right to feel contempt — are those who have seen through this most insidious trap, and are therefore incapable of feeling genuine contempt.

---

## 9. DEHUMANIZATION AND ATROCITY

**L1** - Every genocide begins with the perpetrators seeing their victims as fundamentally other. As less than human. As objects to be eliminated rather than beings to be recognized. The Nazis saw Jews as "vermin." During Rwanda, Tutsis were "cockroaches." This dehumanization isn't just rhetoric—it's psychologically _necessary_. Without it, the perpetrators couldn't do what they do. They need to perceive their victims as dead matter to be disposed of, not living beings to be acknowledged.

**L3** - Maybe give another 2 or 3 examples in bullet form to round that out.

---

## 10. TRUE COMPASSION/KINDNESS (The Solution)

**L0** - Kindness has nothing to do with being nice. It can be fierce or even violent if necessary. It can take on almost any form whatsoever. Its only defining characteristic is that it is utterly free of self-deception. It does not misperceive evil as intrinsic to any mind, and this seemingly-subtle change makes all the difference. It is therefore incapable of _genuine_ malice, contempt, or self-righteousness. It surgically targets the parasite in people's minds, instead of the confused being who unwittingly harbors it. The profound integrity of this act prevents their darkness from using our own as an excuse to justify itself, allowing our message to bypass their defense mechanisms. The aspect of mind _underneath_ their parasite is confronted directly — something it is not accustomed to. It begins to sense that the _real_ fight isn't between the two of you, but between both of you and humanity's ultimate nemesis. You may remain enemies on the surface for a good long while, but underneath, something much more profound is taking place.

**L0** - "Compassion has nothing to do with being nice, or gentle, or tolerant, or even understanding. It has everything to do with seeing that the contempt we feel for other people—including the "bad people"—is a symptom of our own darkness. When we perceive another person as _fundamentally defective_—as though the "badness" is somehow inherent to their mind—we cannot help but feel the urge to shove them deeper _into_ the abyss. Something in us wants them to become worse people so that we can be right about them. We need to see evil as existing only outside of ourselves in order to maintain a coherent self-image."

**L0** - We like to believe that our outer actions are what drive the fate of the world, but in truth, everything comes down to our innermost commitments. When you stay entirely true to your inner Light, people can sense this, and it inoculates them against the darkness. This is called "compassion," and it has nothing to do with being nice. 

**L1** - Cruelty feels like we're "teaching them a lesson," but the only lesson we're teaching is that _darkness is the way._ Thus it is that an action that appears unerringly noble to our conscious minds may secretly be a vector for the darkness, and vice versa.

**L2** - It is nowhere near as viscerally satisfying as unleashing our darkness on them, but infinitely more valuable to the world.

**L1** - Make no mistake: executing this well can require great skill, commensurate with the depth of their infection. The deeper it goes, the more they feel like it _is_ them, and thus the harder it is to evict. Simply pretending or assuming that they're fundamentally good can certainly backfire. But the more clearly you perceive your _own_ inner Light, the less you have to pretend with others. The more directly you are able to cut through their delusion, without falling into the fatal trap of allowing their darkness to unknowingly provoke your own.

**L1** - Just like the darkness can handshake with itself in others, our Light can, too. When we're compassionate with evil people—even fiercely, violently—it's as though our Light is reminding theirs that it has a partner in the fight against our shared nemesis. We can still do this while fighting the human.

**L1** - If we only learn to see this one thing, we will understand the secret mechanism behind _all the evil there ever was_—and we will finally be effective in ending it, instead of mindlessly perpetuating it. Your enemy is infected by a mind-virus that lives within you, too. Heal yourself, and you will automatically learn how to heal them. This is what you most deeply desire, whether you know it yet or not. It is the _only_ path toward healing our broken world.

**L3** - If you want to defeat evil, defeat self-deception. We think that's what we're doing when we contemptuously judge our enemies.

**L3** - We think we're rubbing their noses in their darkness, giving them a chance to see it and repent. But we add a particular charge that says "no matter what you do, I'm going to interpret it in light of my existing knowledge that you're beyond redemption."

---

## 11. THE ROLE OF INTENTIONS AND SUBTLE IMPACT

**L0** - Everything you do makes a difference, in ways that you can hardly fathom. Your deepest intentions always find a way to weave themselves into the very fabric of your reality, nudging it toward either the darkness or the Light. This happens via vast and subtle networks of causality that our conscious minds are not yet ready to perceive, but that ultimately shift our world in much larger ways than the big flashy activity that normally captivates our attention. It is thus that two actions that appear nearly identical from the outside can ultimately result in radically different outcomes. The darkness relies on our willingness to listen to that little voice in our head that tells us whether we're doing right or wrong, instead of simply looking toward the Light within us that always knows.

**L0** - Any action you take from recognition of our Oneness (and which thus nudges us all toward remembering) is by definition good, and the converse is also true. There are infinitely many ways it can manifest.

**L1** - Thus, two behaviors that look nearly identical from the outside can have _profoundly_ different results — and it is exactly this difficulty in telling them apart that our darkness uses to trick us into following it.

**L0** - Every act of integrity, every decision to choose Love even when no one is looking, doesn't cease to matter. It reverberates through the Whole, invisibly mending the torn fabric of our collective psyche; healing the wounds that would otherwise serve as infiltration points for the darkness. Each such act makes our shared reality less hospitable for evil to thrive—but its most profound effect is one of silent solidarity. **Your private integrity invisibly bolsters the resolve of strangers halfway across the world just at the moment they are about to break, lending them the strength to hold the line when they feel they can no longer do so alone.**

---

## 12. PERSONAL EXPERIENCE AND TRANSFORMATION

**L1** - Our vision opens out to the countless ways in which our behavior caused harm, resulting in far-ranging consequences that we never suspected. We feel profound contrition for having fallen victim to this trap, but simultaneously redeemed, because we see that we never really wanted to behave this way; that it was only a kind of infection, and could be healed. In a flash, we see that the same is true of others — and this isn't just a belief, but somehow a _direct perception._

**L1** - With this clarity comes an unshakable commitment to stop perpetuating the darkness, to no longer allow it to masquerade as righteousness. We are free to act from our true Light — not by shoving others into the abyss, but by helping them find their way out of it.

**L2** - An experience of the one person who saw the good in you, when even you couldn't see it in yourself. Their light touching yours. Being led out of the dark. That's what you can be for others. "Evil people" are hopelessly lost. Don't shove them deeper in. It's not coming from your goodness.

---

## 13. CALCULATIONS VS. DEEPER KNOWING

**L0** - You cannot calculate your way to goodness. The reason being that you'll never know whether your calculation is based on self-deception. Humanism as an example.

**L2** - Clever calculations can go arbitrarily far off the rails.

**L2** - We only hear the part of our mind that cleverly calculates how our behavior is somehow a net good.

**L2** - Aspect of your mind that always knows, in each moment, whether your behavior is brightening the world or darkening it for your own supposed benefit.

---

## 14. PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS


**L2** - How genuinely compassionate intent can lead to harm: we love animals, become vegan and then judge everyone who's not. Or we love trees and become ecoterrorists. Maybe give another 2 or 3 examples in bullet form to round that out.

**L2** - It is impossible to overstate just how much of our world is built on self-deception. Some examples are obvious, like when politicians start wars on thinly-veiled excuses. Others are much harder to see — in particular, the ones that benefit us in some way. But the truth is that it's never actually possible to benefit ourselves at the world's expense.

**L2** - This can be _extremely_ hard to admit to ourselves, but it is only by seeing just how cleverly the darkness has seduced our own mind that we begin to understand how to free other people of it. The darkness is a kind of mental parasite, and not intrinsic to any mind.

---

## KEY MISCELLANEOUS POINTS

**L1** - Being free of self-deception doesn't mean that you will necessarily know what behavior is best for the world. It only means that you will act with complete honesty and clean intention. You still need to learn what is helpful and harmful in which situations. This is wisdom, which compassion must be paired with to be truly effective.

**L2** - While it is surely true that "evil wins when good people do nothing," even worse would be to secretly join forces with it.

**L2** - Moral self-licensing says that when we do good things, we license ourselves to do bad/selfish things. But perhaps the reverse is even more true: much of the "good" we do is to hide the subconscious recognition of our dark behavior.

**L1** - The battle between good and evil is not symmetrical. The angel and devil on the shoulder are not equals (one is your nature; one is a parasite). Nor does the devil just whisper obviously-evil ideas in your ear. It speaks using your own voice. The further you drift from your Light, the more easily you confuse the devil's voice for your own, and the harder it is for anyone to convince you otherwise.

**L0** - It actually IS dangerously naive to pretend that an evil person has Light. They WILL use it against you. Both overlooking their Light and pretending to see it when we can't are dangerous, in different ways. That is why it is crucial to learn to _actually_ see it (and the mass that's covering it). That is what inoculates us against the possibility of it being used against us.

**L0** - Nobody could blame us for "picking the wrong one" not because they _can't_ see the difference, but because they're hiding it from themselves so that they can preserve the part of them that wants to be justified in making the same mistake. This is how our darkness colludes. This is why our culture still thinks that contempt for evil people is "righteous." Individuals may know better, but we haven't been able to communicate this as a culture. That's what this piece is attempting to do: put it into language; a framework that people can point to and say: "this."

- The visceral experience of being shown what it was like to become progressively more confused, further from the Light, trusting the voice of the darkness (Stockholm syndrome). And having the meta-perspective (through the mushrooms) of seeing how most people became increasingly contemptuous toward me. When I was closer to the Light, they "loved" me, and the further I drifted, the more they started to hate me (just as I had done in their shoes). But a tiny handful of people always telegraphed through their eyes and behaviors that although what I was doing was unacceptable (and they would stop it), they would never forsake me to the enemy of the Light. They weren't just refusing to let me misbehave; they were refusing to let the darkness claim another soul. And it wasn't a personal decision on their behalf; it was the Light acting through them. Those people had done the work of excising all traces of darkness, and all that remained was the one Light.

L1 - The darkness needs us to see certain people as irredeemable. This way we feel righteous forsaking them; ensuring they never find their way back to the Light.

Fundamental attribution error (Covey quote)

Analogy of making them lose faith in humanity vs restoring faith (charity is one example, but not forsaking evil people is another one that everyone powerfully feels, whether they know it or not.)

L1: Even if we were given the option of our enemy completely reforming (and joining the Light) vs being eternally punished for their sins, a dark part of us would prefer the second.

L1: "Every bone in my body had needed to believe that the problems of the world were caused by something fundamentally alien to me—the result of inherently defective people whom I could never hope to understand; only viciously fight. Sure, we may sometimes commit little misdeeds here or there, but they're of a fundamentally different nature than the _real_ darkness that plagues our world, and so cleaning up our own behavior ranks way down in the list of problems to solve. So what did I do? I created them. I kept them trapped there. All while patting myself on the back for how *righteous* I was being. And it didn't even require overt cruelty. I could make it look nearly identical to genuine righteousness while still getting the job done. All I had to do was harbor *contempt*. Then I could point at what I had created and know, with absolute certainty, that evil was real and that it wasn't me."

**L0** - Why would part of us knowingly reinforce their evil? _See if you can answer this for yourself._

It's so that we can continue to believe that all the problems of the world are caused by something fundamentally alien to us—the result of _inherently defective_ people whom we could never hope to understand, let alone help. Sure, we may sometimes commit little misdeeds here or there, but they're of a fundamentally different nature than the _real_ darkness that plagues our world, and so cleaning up our own behavior ranks way down in the list of problems to solve.

To put it bluntly: we subtly but continually reinforce the evil "out there" to hide our own from ourselves. That is why we fail to defeat the evil in the world. Part of our minds is actively working against this goal—and as we shall soon see, these parts of our minds are not working independently, but somehow collaborating to keep this whole ruse hidden from us.

Their evil is _not_ of a different nature. The subconscious message we deliver to the "bad people" is made of **exactly** the same "stuff" that enables their misbehavior in the first place. Not only do they know this, but we know this, and we know they know this—which is why we know it will work. We are revealing our darkness because we know how they will receive it: as license to embrace theirs.
