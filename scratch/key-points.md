One thing Charles has done a good job of explaining -- but which people somehow don't yet see -- is that the contempt we feel for the evil people out there is a symptom of our own evil. He's not just trying to get people to be nice by saying this. It really is the truth. Evil is insanely clever, and its most brilliant trick is to convince you that it doesn't live in your own mind. If you really want to defeat evil instead of mindlessly adding more to the world, you must develop the capacity to perceive -- not just believe, but perceive -- that evil is not intrinsic to any mind. It's a parasite, and like any parasite, it can be destroyed. Wanting to destroy the host only strengthens the parasite. That's what genuine "spiritual warfare" is about: freeing minds from the parasite of evil, without being taken in by its illusion.

Compassion for evildoers has nothing to do with being nice, or gentle, or tolerant, or even understanding. It has everything to do with seeing that the contempt we feel for other people — including the "bad people" — is a symptom of our own evil. The truth is, when we perceive another person as _fundamentally defective_ — as though the "badness" is not merely incidental to their mind but somehow inherent to it — we cannot help but feel the urge to shove them deeper _into_ the abyss. Something in us wants them to become worse people so that we can be right about them. We need to see evil as existing only outside of ourselves in order to maintain a coherent self-image. 

Something in you wants them to become worse people so that you can be right about them.

- The way it works is by making us _perceive_ it as intrinsic... 

- You simply cannot fathom the full extent of pain and distortion that the Light must undergo in order to become "evil." Your heart would break a billion times over, and then a billion more. By the time a person becomes someone who apparently chooses evil, an unthinkable amount of horror has already ravaged their mindstream. None of this is to suggest that we should feel _sympathy_ for them, because by this point, softness would indeed make things worse, both for them and others. But if you really saw it all, you could never again feel that malicious urge to shove them deeper into the abyss. You would immediately recognize it as the very essence of evil. At the very ultimate level, there is nothing special about any one of us — no cleanliness of soul — that would have ensured we would turn out differently. Seeing this, one truly understands "there but for the grace of God go I."

- How many things we believe only because they secretly serve us in some way.

- How much harm we're able to inject into the world via subtle channels.

- Anger vs contempt; contempt for behaviors and beliefs.


- We therefore allocate more of our attention to _their_ unmistakable evil and less to what is occurring inside us


- Anger is a completely natural, and even healthy, response to such misbehavior. But it is almost always accompanied by malice, contempt, or self-righteousness. These may feel healthy, too, but they are only manifestations of our parasite.
- The darkness tricks us into closing our hearts precisely when they are needed the most.

- The more we forget this, the more we feel like fundamentally separate beings at constant war with intrinsically defective "others." From this confused perspective, we are capable only of spreading more confusion, while feeling flawlessly convinced that we are "fighting evil." The more people fall victim to this darkness, the more we as a society believe its lies — that humans are _fundamentally_ selfish and greedy, and that some people must be forsaken for the benefit of all. By believing these dark lies, we license our own darkness to keep operating, mistaking it for our inner Light, not recognizing it as a counterfeit merely pretending to _be_ us.

- Everything you do makes a difference, in ways that you can hardly fathom. Your deepest intentions always find a way to weave themselves into the very fabric of your reality, nudging it toward either the darkness or the Light. This happens via vast and subtle networks of causality that our conscious minds are not yet ready to perceive, but that ultimately shift our world in much larger ways than the big flashy activity that normally captivates our attention. It is thus that two actions that appear nearly identical from the outside can ultimately result in radically different outcomes. The darkness relies on our willingness to listen to that little voice in our head that tells us whether we're doing right or wrong, instead of simply looking toward the Light within us that always knows.

- It is said that "the elites" are playing us regular folks against each other to take our attention off of them, but the darkness is playing a much bigger game. It doesn't care _who_ we hate, as long as we hate. The effect is always the same: to foment a constant atmosphere of contempt, providing exactly the cover it needs to remain hidden in the shadows. The darkest idea of all is that if we were to round up all the "bad people" and exterminate them, the rest of us would live in harmony. The very self-deception required to harbor this thought guarantees that the darkness would remain behind, in full force; changing only its shape. The very desire to divide the world into the fundamentally good and bad; those who deserve our compassion and those who deserve our contempt, is how our darkness keeps its foot in the door, biding its time, waiting for the right conditions, so that it may manifest as full-blown evil. This is the root cause of every atrocity that has ever been committed.

- It continually drives humanity toward various kinds of Armageddon: situations in which everyone is violently proving how _righteous_ they are. It is why the US is headed toward civil war without anyone suspecting their own complicity, and explains bitter [divorces](https://www.gottman.com/blog/this-one-thing-is-the-biggest-predictor-of-divorce/) in which each side feels like the exclusive victim / hero. Nearly the whole world is caught in its terrible sway, evil provoking "righteous" retribution at every turn, without anyone ever noticing the true source of it all.

- It is only by seeing how thoroughly we — the "good people" — been tricked that we begin to appreciate just how terrifyingly clever the darkness is, and just how deeply the "bad people" are trapped.

- We lie to ourselves in a million tiny ways all the time; our mind angling to gain subtle advantages for ourselves, but of course never letting us know that it is doing so. Our unconscious desires weave themselves into the very fabric of our reality, manipulating it in nearly-invisible ways that supposedly benefit us while gradually degrading the whole. Yet degrading the whole can never ultimately benefit us — a fact that we are slowly waking up to as a species. We are aware that "bad people" are destroying our very biosphere to line their own pockets, but we haven't yet made the connection between our own behavior and theirs. We still believe that our hatred for them is a sign of the good within us, but only because we are still not looking too carefully.


- Suppose a politician says we should go to war with country X to save their people or bring them democracy or whatever. In the back of their mind, suppose their primary goal is actually to get oil, or get re-elected, or whatever — knowing fully well that it will bring great harm not only to the country's citizens, but to the world at large. But the knowledge of this deception can be hidden even from their own conscious minds. In one sense, they're not "bad people," because they "really are" trying to help — as far as they can tell. And yet, part of them secretly knows, and — surprisingly — it is possible to tell this from the outside. It can never be completely hidden.

    This capacity for self-deception exists in everyone, but along a continuum. The further along it they are (and the smarter they are), the better they are able to hide it behind agendas that look exciting and helpful and shiny from the outside, but are secretly rotten from the inside — eating away at the world in ways that can be hard to detect until it's too late. The more free your own mind is from self-deception, the better you get at detecting it in others, and the less you fall for this trap.

    Now of course everybody believes that they're free of it, and this is something only "bad people" do — because by its very nature, it's not something we can (normally) perceive in ourselves. But it turns out that this belief is _itself_ the surest sign that it's operating in us. The Darkness _needs_ us to believe this, because then it can execute its most insidious operation: it gets us to behave in subtly dark ways — such as maliciously mocking and shaming our enemies — that actually drive the darkness deeper _into_ their minds while convincing us that there was no malice involved; or, even if there was, that it's for the greater good. But part of us secretly knows the truth, and we lock this truth away in a hidden compartment in our minds.
    
    But there can come a turning point in life where the whole storehouse of self-deception is unveiled, and we see how much harm it has caused. It is impossibly painful. After this, you don't magically become a "good person," but your own self-deception actually becomes painful, so that you're forced to acknowledge it when it arises, and to clean it up bit by bit.

    We overlook the self-deception in people whose own hidden agendas align with our own, and exaggerate it in those whose are anti-aligned.

- Clever calculations

- We only hear the part of our mind that cleverly calculates how our behavior is somehow a net good.

- Aspect of your mind that always knows, in each moment, whether your behavior is brightening the world or darkening it for your own supposed benefit.
 

- People are only able to cause harm due to a kind of self-deception. Part of them knows _perfectly well_ that they're doing wrong, but this knowledge is very carefully shielded from conscious self-reflection, so that it doesn't _feel_ wrong. All they hear are their own clever justifications. It is a profound form of self-deception. This bizarre schism of mind is the secret behind _all the evil there ever was_ — and it has enabled our own misbehavior, too, if we're honest. Every one of us has skirted our conscience before, pretending either that we couldn't hear it or that we didn't have to listen. Our examples may differ in degree, but not in kind.

- This mechanism is very difficult to recognize in ourselves, but very easy to see in our enemies. This makes us treat them with contempt, convinced that we're helping the world.

- The darkness is caused by a kind of parasite in the mind — but yours and mine aren't truly separate.

- The only reason we perceive evil as _intrinsic_ to other minds is so that we will feel morally licensed to viciously attack them for it.

- The truth is, every misbehavior, from the slightest skirting of conscience to the most horrific war crime, is enabled by precisely the same mechanism — and every time anyone engages in it for any reason whatsoever, they induce the same tendency in others.


- It is impossible to overstate just how much of our world is built on self-deception. Some examples are obvious, like when politicians start wars on thinly-veiled excuses. Others are much harder to see — in particular, the ones that benefit us in some way. But the truth is that it's never actually possible to benefit ourselves at the world's expense.


- If you really wish to defeat evil instead of mindlessly adding more to the world, you must develop the capacity to perceive — not just believe, but perceive — that evil is not intrinsic to any mind.
 

- There is an aspect of our mind that always knows whether our behavior will brighten the world or darken it for our own personal gain.


- Notice how the word "right" is a synonym for both "good" and "correct." This is not an accident: something in you knows that what is good is what is most correct.


- The vast majority of human activity takes place beneath our conscious thresholds.



- Contempt is the secret handshake our parasites use to provoke each other while making us feel noble for doing so.


- Looking at precisely the same entity...


- What you ultimately are is a Light so vast that it defies description; a profound Love for all of reality that excludes nothing and forsakes no-one — including the targets of its fearsome wrath, should that be necessary.


- With this clarity comes an unshakable commitment to stop perpetuating the darkness, to no longer allow it to masquerade as righteousness. We are free to act from our true Light — not by shoving others into the abyss, but by helping them find their way out of it.


- The darkness does not ultimately have its own existence; it is merely our willingness to look away from our inner Light for long enough to be distracted by a counterfeit, which we then take as our new North Star. The longer we follow it, the less we are able to tell the two apart — until finally, they are indistinguishable. It is not that they look at all the same; it is that we have been lured into a trance. We have completely forgotten that there _was_ (and still is) a blazing Light whose authority is completely beyond question. It does not bend itself to our personal agendas or whims in the slightest, because it is pure integrity.


- Every time we are unkind to _anyone_, act selfishly, or otherwise skirt our conscience in any way, we are feeding the Beast; humanity's true nemesis.


- Desire to add to their burden.


- This is what's most crucial to see. The **only** way a person can engage in dark behavior is for it to remain hidden from conscious self-reflection, so that in a peculiar sense, they genuinely _do not know_ that they're doing it. This is why attacking them for it doesn't work. It only provokes their defense mechanisms. Again, what we can't see is that we are _trying_ to provoke those defense mechanisms, because this strengthens their self-deceptive tendency, thus a reinforcing a polarization that secretly benefits us.


- Every action you've ever taken has nudged us all either toward remembering this or forgetting it. One is the very essence of good, and the other, of evil. Yet they can be extremely difficult to tell apart: an action that looks good on the surface can be evil, and vice versa. The _content_ matters far less than the intention — not the conscious intentions that we're normally aware of, and that the road to hell is paved with — but our _innermost_ intentions. Our actions become _infused_ with those intentions, which are thereby woven into the very fabric of our reality, subconsciously inspiring or infecting countless others in a cascade effect. We can see all this if we look. The darkness relies on our willingness not to look, and to instead trust our conscious agendas; that little voice in our heads. The more we make this mistake, the further we drift from our inner Light — and the harder it becomes for others to rescue us from our own confusion. The more clearly we see this trap, the less urge we feel to shove others deeper into it.



- In this shadowy state, we license ourselves to get away with things that we otherwise could not – and that we would never tolerate in our enemies.


- This knowledge may be hidden from conscious self-reflection, but crucially, it's not entirely unconscious, either. It exists in a kind of limbo state, and we _can_ become entirely conscious of it.

- When we do, something astonishing happens. We discover that this capacity for self-deception is caused by a kind of mental parasite. While we were under its sway, it felt like it _was_ us. We _wanted_ to shove other people into the abyss, and it felt impossibly righteous to do so. But now we see that this was only ever the parasite cleverly masquerading _as_ us. It fed on our weaknesses, exploiting our fear and pride, enabling us to engage in myriad self-serving behaviors that we couldn't recognize as such, and that we would never tolerate in our enemies. Our vision opens out to the countless ways in which our behavior caused harm, resulting in far-ranging consequences that we never suspected. We feel profound contrition for having fallen victim to this trap, but simultaneously redeemed, because we see that we never really wanted to behave this way; that it was only a kind of infection, and could be healed. In a flash, we see that the same is true of others — and this isn't just a belief, but somehow a _direct perception._


- The darkness that exists in them exists within us, too, even if it feeds on a different set of psychological motivations. Theirs may be related to money or power, while ours is simply about the need to feel like "good people." Yet no matter how seemingly-innocent our motivation, the net effect is ultimately the same. By engaging in **any** form of self-deception, we induce the same tendency in others. It is _infectious_.


- We lost contact with our absolute goodness, and so we went out searching for our goodness relatively — that is, by making other people bad. How ironic that our faint memory of our goodness ended up causing so much harm.



- The deepest part of us knows that we're not intrinsically superior to anyone — including the "bad people" — but our self-deceptive capacity tricks us into believing that we are. By making us perceive certain people as _fundamentally defective_ — in other words, with contempt — it secretly telegraphs our own self-deception to them. This causes them to perceive _us_ as defective, making them feel more justified in their misbehavior, which proves to us that they are indeed defective. This _increases_ the self-deception in the world. We don't mock and shame our enemies _despite_ it making them dig in their heels, but _because_ of it. If you look carefully enough into your mind in that moment, here's what you will find: something in you _wants_ to flash your capacity for darkness to your enemies, hoping that it will subdue theirs. But another part knows that this is a sham: it's not actually meant to _suppress_ their darkness, but to _provoke_ it in a way that will force you to unleash more righteous fury.


- This knowledge exists in a kind of limbo state. On one level, it feels completely noble: you're not _provoking_ their darkness, but merely exposing it for the world to see. Besides, cruelty _can_ suppress other people's misbehavior — at least, their _public_ misbehavior, and for a time. Thus, we easily convince ourselves that it "works." But another part of you secretly knows that it will only _increase_ the net darkness in the world.


- On the surface, we and they may be enemies, but under the covers, our darkness is secretly allied. This is the trick by which the darkness spreads nearly unchecked, getting each of us to strengthen it while flawlessly convinced that we're fighting it. And the darker the world becomes, the harder it gets to see that this is what we're actually doing.


- All of our parasites together behave like a distributed malevolent entity, manipulating all of humanity from beneath our conscious thresholds. The Christians know it as the Devil, and the Buddhists call it the ego. You can treat this as a metaphor, but it is also as real as anything you can touch. It is why some people believe in the existence of an evil global conspiracy pulling the strings from behind the scenes. It is the _primordial_ evil conspiracy; the one to which all the rest owe their existence, and to which they all ultimately filter up. It keeps our attention fixated perpetually outward, on the evil "out there," to prevent us from looking closely enough "in here," at the one place where we can actually defeat it, and thereby be of genuine service to others. Every act of unkindness we have ever perpetrated on _anyone_ has secretly been in its service — and part of us has always known this.

- But this knowledge rarely reaches conscious awareness. We only hear the part of our mind that cleverly calculates how our behavior was a net good. The knowledge of our darkness exists in a kind of limbo state, but we _can_ learn to become fully conscious of it. When we do, something astonishing happens.


- At the very deepest level, nobody could possibly want it. Yet the more deeply it has ensnared their minds, the less able they are to recognize it. The only reason we perceive evil as being _intrinsic_ to their minds is because our own parasite has ensnared _us._ Its whole trick is to alter our perception at such a deep level that certain people appear _fundamentally defective_, thus making contempt feel not only justified, but positively righteous. It is precisely the same trick that has enabled every atrocity ever committed. Every time any one of us accedes to this misperception — no matter who our target is — we reinforce the same tendency in others. This is how the darkness spreads without anyone being aware of their own complicity.


- This can be _extremely_ hard to admit to ourselves, but it is only by seeing just how cleverly the darkness has seduced our own mind that we begin to understand how to free other people of it. The darkness is a kind of mental parasite, and not intrinsic to any mind.


- We like to believe that our innermost intentions have no effect on the world; that they remain confined to our skulls, and only our actions have consequences — but this is precisely how our darkness gets us to look away for long enough to infuse itself _into_ those very actions, thereby escaping our skulls and weaving itself into the fabric of our reality. A deep part of us knows when our actions are not fully aligned with the Light, but with our own self-interest instead. This knowledge subtly taints those actions, so that even the most noble-sounding project only induces more self-serving behavior in everyone it touches, even as they're convinced that they're doing good.


- This is why it's impossible to fight darkness with darkness: darkness never actually _tries_ to fight itself; it is only ever on its own team, and all it has to do to win is convince us to use it as a tool to further our supposedly noble agendas.


- Kindness has nothing to do with being nice. It can be fierce or even violent if necessary. It can take on almost any form whatsoever. Its only defining characteristic is that it is utterly free of self-deception. It does not misperceive evil as intrinsic to any mind, and this seemingly-subtle change makes all the difference. It is therefore incapable of _genuine_ malice, contempt, or self-righteousness. It targets the parasite in people's minds, instead of the confused being who unwittingly harbors it. The profound integrity of this act prevents their darkness from using our own as an excuse to justify itself, allowing our message to bypass their defense mechanisms. The aspect of mind _underneath_ their parasite is confronted directly — something it is not accustomed to. It begins to sense that the _real_ fight isn't between the two of you, but between both of you and humanity's ultimate nemesis. You may remain enemies on the surface for a good long while, but underneath, something much more profound is taking place.


- It is nowhere near as viscerally satisfying as unleashing our darkness on them, but infinitely more valuable to the world.


- Make no mistake: executing this well can require great skill, commensurate with the depth of their infection. The deeper it goes, the more they feel like it _is_ them, and thus the harder it is to evict. Simply pretending or assuming that they're fundamentally good can certainly backfire. But the more clearly you perceive your _own_ inner Light, the less you have to pretend with others. The more directly you are able to cut through their delusion, without falling into the fatal trap of allowing their darkness to unknowingly provoke your own. As this happens, it becomes obvious that the whole distinction between fundamentally good and bad people; those who deserve our compassion and those who deserve our contempt; is itself a trap of the darkness.



- At the very deepest level, you _are_ the Light. So is everybody else. In fact, you _are_ everybody and everything else, just pretending that you're not. One consciousness, dreaming countless perspectives. 


- Realizing this in its entirety is known as _enlightenment_, but all of us can sense it to some degree or another at all times. It is only by turning away from this ultimate truth that we are able to feel contempt, and thereby willingly cause harm. The deepest part of us _knows_ that we are not intrinsically superior to anyone, including the "bad people" — and that nothing positive is gained by pretending that we are. Again, this has nothing to do with tolerating their behavior, and everything to do with seeing how our own darkness manipulates us in precisely the same way that theirs does them.


- The more darkness there is "out there," the more justified every one of us feels in acting selfishly. Yet it never feels selfish; it just feels like what we _must_ do. The self-serving aspects of our own agendas and behaviors become much harder to consciously recognize in this state, while those of others become _easier_ to see. This is not an accident. The way the darkness works is by cleverly hiding itself from our own minds while loudly announcing it to others, so that each of us is flawlessly convinced that we're fighting evil while we're really just strengthening it.



- We like to believe that our outer actions are what drive the fate of the world, but in truth, everything comes down to our innermost commitments. When you stay entirely true to your inner Light, people can sense this, and it inoculates them against the darkness. This is called "compassion," and it has nothing to do with being nice. That is only a lie that the darkness tells to prevent us from recognizing the true power of our Light. Compassion can be fierce, or even violent, as the situation warrants. But its profound integrity prevents others from using our darkness as an excuse to cozy up to theirs. Conversely, cruelty _can_ suppress other people's misbehavior — at least, their _public_ misbehavior, and for a time. It feels like we're "teaching them a lesson," but the only lesson we're teaching is that _darkness is the way._ Thus it is that an action that appears unerringly noble to our conscious minds may secretly be a vector for the darkness, and vice versa. Yet there is a part of us that always knows. The darkness relies on our willingness to not remember this deeper part of ourselves, and to instead trust our consciously-held agendas and calculations. In fact, the darkness is ultimately _nothing but_ this willingness to not look too closely — and it is contagious.



- The deeper our infection, the more situations there seem to be in which unkindness is justified or even righteous — yet we become increasingly unable to recognize that we're being manipulated. We progressively confuse the darkness for our inner Light, not realizing that we're following a counterfeit. Eventually, it completely usurps the throne. This is where the "bad people" are trapped — and our desire to contemptuously judge them for it is nothing but our own parasite seducing us. Its whole trick is to make us feel _intrinsically_ superior to others, so that it feels deliciously righteous to shove them deeper into the abyss. We don't recognize that they're in the grips of a parasite, and that we're shoving them deeper into its clutches. We feel like we're "teaching them a lesson," but the only lesson we're conveying is that _darkness is the way._ 



- It is impossible to overstate the shock when this illusion is first fully punctured. It feels very much like being freed from a demonic possession. We discover firsthand how all beings are variations of the same basic pattern; one Light, obscured in countless astonishing ways — and we vow to never again shove these reflections of ourselves further into the dark.


- To be clear: there certainly are people whose infection runs so deep that any attempt to perceive their inner light would be dangerously naive — for most of us, anyway. They are suffering from a kind of Stockholm Syndrome, believing the darkness to be their friend. It _is_ still possible to wish such people free of their delusion while also taking the necessary precautions. But their darkness is especially clever at evoking our own without our conscious awareness. It is almost impossible not to hate them — or to notice that our contempt for them _always_ weaves itself into the fabric of our reality, lowering the threshold for genuine atrocities to occur somewhere, somehow, in ways that we will never notice our own complicity in. This is the hardest thing to communicate: our darkness _always_ leaks, via subtle networks of causality — even when we are convinced that it remains confined to our own skulls. We _can_ learn to detect this.




- The truth is that part of us can always perceive this "deeper aspect of mind" in others; even the "bad people." Yet we tend to perceive them as _fundamentally morally defective_. Just bring to mind anyone whom you consider a "bad person." They don't have to be Hitler; your average political opponent will do. When we're locked in conflict, it's easy to believe that no such aspect of mind even exists within them — or that even if it does, that they're still a lost cause. What we can't see is that this desire to forsake another human being is itself a form of evil — perhaps the most clever one of all.


- Don't take my word for this. Pause and taste how contempt has exactly the same flavor as pure malevolence. The urge to forsake another human is the desire to shove them deeper into the abyss; to smother their inner light. It is fundamentally malicious, and others can sense this, even when we ourselves cannot. Although it may seem to have positive effects in the short term, its ultimate effect is to darken the world. Why do we do this? There's a widespread belief that humans are fundamentally selfish and greedy, but this is a lie. The desire to hide the truth from ourselves is not intrinsic to our minds; it is caused by a kind of mind-virus 


- The worse things get, the more we close our hearts, believing it to be necessary or even righteous in the fight against evil. We license ourselves to engage in a million tiny selfish behaviors that we do not recognize as such, never noticing that the cumulative effect of this self-deception is to empower the shadowy aspects of our civilization. The great evils of the world simply could not occur without billions of us maintaining a perpetual atmosphere of contempt and animosity. This is the hardest thing to describe. Although some people undoubtedly choose to be evil, their choice cannot be separated from our own decision to turn away from our own inner light. The horrifying agreements that politicians and corporations make in the shadows are mirror images of our own willingness to close our hearts; to willfully deceive ourselves. Reality is ultimately one inseparable whole, and even our subtlest inner intentions unfailingly manifest in the outward tapestry of our lives.


- To be perfectly clear: there certainly _are_ especially "evil" people who knowingly harbor the darkness, and who conspire to bring great harm — and they must be fought relentlessly. But to the degree that we perceive the evil as _intrinsic_ to their minds, our behavior can only reinforce it — even when we believe that we have extinguished it. Our contempt _always_ leaks into the world, darkening it via subtle networks of causality that our conscious minds cannot perceive, undermining any temporary positive effects. It lowers the threshold for evil to manifest elsewhere, where we will feel absolutely no complicity for it. 


- It is a Faustian bargain: our agendas get furthered while the darkness gets a tighter grip on the world.




- Ironically, the only people who _are_ superior — and thus have any right to feel contempt — are those who have seen through this most insidious trap, and are therefore incapable of feeling genuine contempt.


- It is by looking away from our Light that the darkness creeps in. Indeed, the darkness is _nothing but_ our willingness to look away. The result of this decision is **always** evil, and yet the _decision itself_ is not evil. It is a form of profound confusion. Your decision to hate bad people is not evil, but any action you take from this place _will_ darken the world, one way or another, without your conscious knowledge. 


- It is a story as old as humanity itself, and the only reason it persists is that we have told ourselves that we are uniquely immune. We could never be _those people_ — after all, look at how much we hate and judge them. But the truth is that as long as we endorse any distinction whatsoever between _fundamentally good_ and _fundamentally bad_ people; those who deserve our compassion and those who deserve only contempt, it means that we are _already_ those people in fledgling form. For we do not yet recognize that this distinction exists _only_ as a way for our darkness to keep its foot in the door, waiting for the right conditions, to manifest in its full sinister glory. We may believe that we can maintain a "proper balance," reserving our spite for those who genuinely deserve it — but if so, it only means that we're not yet aware of just how much damage we're already doing. This only proves that we are _especially_ susceptible.





- Thus, two behaviors that look nearly identical from the outside can have _profoundly_ different results — and it is exactly this difficulty in telling them apart that our darkness uses to trick us into following it.


- Full implications of their behavior...


- Act dismayed


- We each feel like we are advancing our righteous agendas, but the only real winner is the darkness itself.
