Directly perceiving the full interconnectedness and "oneness" of reality is what contemplative traditions would call enlightenment, but all of us can taste it to some degree or another long before then. That's why literature like the following speaks to us so powerfully. (It is also why we sometimes thank people for acts of charity that don't seem to benefit us directly. We can sense that whatever happens to the world ultimately happens to us.)

[This quote](https://www.amazon.com/Hardcore-Zen-Monster-Movies-Reality/dp/1614293163) from Zen priest (and punk rocker) Brad Warner:

> Even if I want to put this realization down I can’t. Sometimes it’s excruciating. You know those morons that rammed those planes into the World Trade Center? That was me. The people that died in the collapse. Me again. Every single person who ever paid money for a Pet Rock? Me. I don’t mean I identify with them or sympathize with them. I mean I _am_ them. It’s impossible to explain any more clearly than that, but this isn’t a figure of speech or bad poetry. I mean it absolutely literally.
>
> But the universe is sooooo much bigger than any of that. The sky is me, and the stars too, and the chirping crickets and the songs they make; sparkling rivers, snow and rain, distant solar systems and whatever beings may live there: it’s all me. And it’s you, too.
