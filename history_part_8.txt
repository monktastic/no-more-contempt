Kindness is the hardest word to define, but also the most important. It doesn't mean being nice. Nice means pleasant and agreeable, which can actually be harmful in certain situations. Kindness is something much more profound. It is the right motivation in literally _every_ circumstance. But how could kindness be the correct response to evil?

---

Our usual instinct is to be nasty to perpetrators. We may have the good sense not to be overtly cruel, but we often can't help but inject at least a little bit of darkness into our interactions. We reason that as long as it produces a positive outcome — such as suppressing their misbehavior — that it's not actually dark in the first place. What could be wrong with harboring a bit of malice or contempt in our hearts, after all? They aren't externally visible, and therefore could have no effect on the world. And anyway, it's our right to feel how we do. But the darkness is infinitely more clever than you can fathom. Simply by harboring it, you are telegraphing to your enemy that you are under its malevolent sway. This provokes the darkness in them, which you then use as proof that you were right about them, thereby licensing escalation. Part of you _knows_ that this will be the outcome — but it's so cleverly disguised that nobody will be able to blame you for it. It is the perfect crime.

If you look carefully enough into your mind while feeling contempt for _anyone_ — that is, the sense that they are _fundamentally_ defective, and that you are _intrinsically_ superior — you will discover that its secret purpose is to shove them deeper _into_ the abyss; to _smother_ their inner Light, so that you can convince yourself that they _have_ no such Light. In this dark place, cruelty becomes righteous, and you _will_ overlook the harmful and self-serving aspects of your own actions and agendas. It is completely inevitable. This is impossibly dark behavior, and yet we never recognize it as such. Or more precisely, part of us _does_ recognize it, but we don't let this knowledge reach conscious awareness.

This is the secret mechanism behind _all the evil there ever was_. "Bad people" know perfectly well when they are doing wrong, but this knowledge is carefully shielded from conscious self-reflection, so that it doesn't _feel_ wrong. The reason we hate them is not to _expose_ their darkness, but to force them to suppress it even harder, so that we have something external to blame for the sorry state of the world. The whole purpose of contempt is to help us hide our own darkness from ourselves.

Kindness is any behavior that brings the darkness to Light, and evil is anything that hides it. Every act of unkindness is secretly an attempt to drive other people's self-deception deeper into their minds, and is therefore evil. If you are perceptive enough while behaving this way, you will discover that you somehow already knew this, but couldn't admit it to yourself. It is itself an act of profound self-deception; of hiding from your Light. This alone would have told you that it would only produce more evil, no matter how convincingly it claims otherwise. Every time any one of us acts from self-deception, we induce the same tendency in everyone else. This is how the darkness spreads, without anyone recognizing their own complicity. The "trick" to remaining kind — if you can call it that — is to never depart from your inner Light under any circumstances. If there is even a trace of malice, contempt, or self-righteousness anywhere in your heart, it _will_ darken the world — and part of you will always know it.

---

There can be moments in life — such as during psychedelic trips, near-death experiences, or deep meditation or prayer — when you are confronted with the full depths of your own self-deception. You are shown every single instance where you skirted your conscience in any way; every act of lying to yourself for your own personal gain. You stand face-to-face with all the harm you've ever perpetrated since time immemorial, and it is far more than you could hope to clean up in a single lifetime. The pain is beyond what you can fathom, or think you can bear. How widely and quickly it spread! How many it affected! The darkness exploited your fear and pride, enabling you to do things you otherwise couldn't if only you had been seeing clearly.

But slowly, it dawns on you: the reason it hurts so much is that you never actually wanted to do this. It is only profound confusion that enabled it. Your whole being is absorbed into that part of you that never wanted to hurt anyone; never _could_ want such a thing. And then it happens: the full mass of darkness is suddenly lifted from your mind. It feels exactly like you'd imagine being freed of a demonic possession. Beneath it is a Light so vast that it defies description; an infinite Love for all of reality that excludes nothing and forsakes no-one — including the targets of its fearsome wrath, should that be necessary. You could never truly depart from your Light, because it turns out you _are_ the Light — and, astonishingly, so is everyone else.

It turns out you ultimately _are_ everyone and everything else, just pretending that you're not. One consciousness, peering out through countless eyes. There are many ways to say this, all of which sound absurd to the rational mind. But when you fully unveil the Light in yourself, you automatically see it in everyone else — including those who seemed not to have any. This is what the darkness is trying to hide. Everything we do to each other — or to Nature herself — we ultimately do to ourselves. How crazy to think otherwise! How foolish to hate others for not seeing it yet, when such hatred is exactly the same mistake! Such a silly game we play, with such tragic consequences. Humanity has trapped itself in the ultimate Mexican standoff.

The strangest part is discovering how you simultaneously _knew_ all this and yet somehow _didn't_. You convinced yourself that your unkind behavior was "for the greater good," even as part of you knew that it would only spread darkness. You could perceive the inner Light in the "bad people," but you chose to smother it anyway — knowing that if you compartmentalized this knowledge carefully enough, nobody could blame you or make you feel guilty for it, because _you yourself_ would no longer know. Yet others could somehow sense what you were really doing, and they pounced on this chance to pin the evils of the world on you. It is only now that you see how they were only lost in the same confusion that you were that you are able to truly forgive them. You discover the surprising sense in which nobody actually _wants_ to harbor the darkness — or rather, how their apparent desire to harbor it is but a mirror image of our own desire to see it as _intrinsic_ to them.

You see for the first time _how_ others could sense what you were really doing, despite your astonishingly clever attempts to hide it. At the very deepest level, your mind is not truly separate from theirs, or from the world at large. It's not that others can read your mind, per se, but your deepest motivations invariably weave themselves into the very fabric of your "outer" reality; the two being fundamentally inseparable — and the very deepest choice of all is whether to stand by your inner Light or to turn away from it. You make this choice in every moment, whether you know it or not — and the cumulative result determines your ultimate impact on the world. Others sense these choices at a subconscious level, and it subtly influences their own. Our culture has convinced itself that this is mystical nonsense, and now you see why. We still struggle to give up our own demons, and so we cling to a worldview that convinces us that harboring them can have no external consequences.

There is no way to force others to see any of this; force being a manifestation of the same fundamental mistake. Those who are most powerful at inducing this realization in others are simply those who hold it most strongly themselves. They are literally incapable of feeling malice, contempt, or self-righteousness, having thoroughly seen through them as horsemen of the darkness. Something about their presence enables our own hidden darkness to come to Light. Make no mistake: this is not always a gentle process. They may have to fiercely confront us and hold us to account. It may require tough love, but crucially, it is still Love — and something in us can sense the difference. There is no trace of intention to shove us deeper in. Our mind searches desperately for a way to attack them in return, but, as their mind is free of darkness, our accusation finds no footing. We are given no option but to look within, where we cannot help but discover what they were pointing to. They weren't attacking _us_, but only our shared nemesis. To save face, we may still perceive them as enemies, but something within us has shifted imperceptibly. This process can take a long time to unfold, but it is the _only_ way the darkness is released from our world.

---

If we ultimately are the Light, how on Earth did we get here? This process is extremely tricky to convey, because it doesn't fit into our culture's default metaphysics. You could say it all began with a subtle turn away from the Light. Then, fearing that we'd lost contact with our _absolute_ goodness, we went out seeking for it _relatively_ — that is, at the expense of apparent "others." We felt that we had to make them _bad_, and then violently defeat them, to earn our way back to our original goodness — and as we did so, it spiraled out of control. This is the apparent reality in which we now live.

The hardest thing to communicate about this story is that it does not unfold in what we normally conceive of as linear time. In a profound and surprising sense, every moment is the very first. Thus, every instant is an opportunity to rediscover our primordial Home — a place we never truly left. Each time we see this, we increasingly discover how our judgements of others are actually pointers back to an unhealed part of ourselves. As we heal ourselves, we discover how to heal our relationship with the "other," until it slowly dawns on us that there was never truly an "other." The more we see this, the more we vow to hold the Light for these seeming others, even when — indeed, _especially_ when — they cannot hold it for themselves. Far from being a burden, we discover that this has always been our true purpose; our deepest calling.

Thus, kindness is anything that brings us all closer to remembering the truth, and evil is anything that pushes us away from it. Forsaking others is always a form of evil. It is only forsaking ourselves because we are not ready to come Home yet. If this language feels too religious for you, feel free to find your own framing. In the end, there is only one truth anyway.

---

The darkness is ultimately nothing but our willingness to turn away from our inner Light, instead listening to our agendas and justifications. Yet make no mistake: although it is an absence, it still behaves like a sinister presence; like a parasite of the mind. The darkness you see your enemies is the very _same_ entity in your mind that provokes you into seeing theirs as intrinsic. It manipulates your perception at such a fundamental level that you simply cannot fathom that you're being fooled. You're certain that you're seeing reality _as it is_. It is an _impossibly_ clever trick.

This is why we sometimes fear the existence of an evil global conspiracy running the world from behind the scenes. The darkness in our minds is indeed conspiring, together behaving like a singular _distributed malevolent entity_, manipulating all of humanity from beneath our conscious thresholds. The Christians know it as the Devil, and the Buddhists call it the ego. You can treat it as a metaphor, but it is also as real as anything you can touch. It is the _primordial_ evil conspiracy; the one to which all the rest owe their existence, and to which they ultimately filter up. The reason we never seem able to fully unveil it is that it lives deep within the crevices of our own minds. It keeps our attention fixated perpetually outward, on the evil "out there," so that we will never look "in here," at the one place where we can actually defeat it. Every attempt to subdue it externally without being free of it internally just gives it more power. It cannot be any other way.

It is impossible to overstate just how much of our current civilization is built on the shaky foundations of our collective self-deception. Everything from our unhealthy air, water, and soil, to our deep societal ills, is ultimately an external manifestation of a sickness within. It is the root cause of our climate crisis. As long as we perceive this sickness to exist only in other people, we will never discover the hidden aspect of ourselves that has been secretly enabling it, even as the bulk of our mind convinces us that we were fighting it. This is in no way suggesting that we are all equally complicit by any stretch. Far from it. Yet we each have a surprising amount of untapped potential in leading the world back to the Light.

We've been led astray by a society that points us in precisely the wrong direction to accomplish this. Our power does not lie in our superiority over others — including the "bad people" — but in our ultimate commonality with them. This is not some kumbaya sentiment, either. As mentioned before, genuine kindness has nothing to do with being nice. It can be fierce or even violent if necessary. It can look like almost anything at all. Its only defining characteristic is that it is utterly free of self-deception.  It does not perceive evil as intrinsic to any mind, and this seemingly-subtle change makes all the difference. It surgically targets the parasite itself, instead of the confused being who unwittingly harbors it. The profound integrity of this act prevents their darkness from finding the "hook" in our own that it would normally use to justify itself, and is thereby weakened.

To be clear: it does no good to pretend that you can see the Light in others when you cannot. This can backfire miserably, as it rapidly degrades into merely being _nice._ Thus, both pretending to see the good in others and overlooking it are harmful. The only solution is to learn to actually see it, and the only way to do that is to fully uncover our own, by whatever means necessary. At the same time, it is astonishingly easy to lie to ourselves about whether we are wielding fierce compassion or merely pretending to. Perhaps the clearest measure of our own ability to deceive ourselves is how much contempt we are able to muster for our enemies; the "bad people." As long as this potential is present, we are liable to slide down the dark path that has enabled every atrocity there ever was. All that is required is the right — or wrong — confluence of circumstances. This happens faster than you can imagine, and you _do not_ want to find yourself there. You _will_ have to confront it, sooner or later.

---

There are vast and subtle networks of causality that we are normally unconscious of, and that secretly drive the fate of the world. If we pay attention only to the surface activity, we miss out on the bulk of what actually shapes our reality. Evil can look sweet and pretty, while kindness may look nothing like our naive interpretations of it. It is impossible to know which is which — and easy to convince ourselves otherwise — until we have done the deep inner work that eradicates the core confusion. We each catch glimpses from time to time, and it is our sacred duty to carry those glimpses into the world as best we are able. I wish I could tell you that I have completed the journey myself, but alas, I am a mere fledgling. I am still liable to mess things up royally, and I hope you will hold my feet to the fire when I do. I promise to do the same for you.

May all beings be free from suffering and its causes. Amen.

What could be wrong with harboring a bit of malice or contempt in our hearts, anyway? They're just private feelings with no external effect. But part of us knows this story is a sham. Something in us is secretly trying to _provoke_ their darkness. We tell ourselves that we're just exposing the darkness already there — which is a good thing! — but the truth is that we're knowingly driving it deeper into their minds, thereby creating _more_ evil in the world. Yet we must never admit this to ourselves, or else we'd be no better than they are, which is the whole point of our ruse.

The most fascinating part is _how_ we drive the darkness deeper in. Simply by harboring malice — whether we're conscious of it or not — we're signaling to our enemy that we're under the malevolent sway of the very thing that we're viciously judging _them_ for; and moreover, that we _know_ this, but are refusing to take responsibility for it. The darkness in our minds is telegraphing itself to them while carefully hiding itself from us. When they inevitably perceive this as evil, it only proves our point: they must be fundamentally irredeemable, just as we suspected. The secret goal is to prove to us that the darkness exists only in other people, thereby giving us something external to blame for the sorry state of the world. This way, we will never notice our own complicity. This doesn't even require outright malice, per se. Simply by perceiving ourselves as _intrinsically_ superior to others; seeing them as _fundamentally_ defective, this process is inevitable.

This is impossibly dark behavior, and yet we never recognize it as such. Or more precisely, part of us _does_ recognize it, but we don't let this knowledge reach conscious awareness.

"Bad people" know perfectly well when they are doing wrong, but this knowledge is carefully shielded from conscious self-reflection, so that it doesn't _feel_ wrong. The reason we hate them is not to expose or subdue their darkness — like we tell ourselves — but to trick them into suppressing it even harder while blaming it on them, making them appear even more obviously defective, so that we can better hide our own darkness from ourselves.

This is how the darkness spreads, with nobody recognizing their own involvement. This is how the darkness spreads, with nobody recognizing their own involvement. In this state, cruelty becomes righteous, and we inevitably overlook the harmful and self-serving aspects of our own actions and agendas. This is what the darkness is ultimately trying to achieve: a world in which it has complete dominion, tricking us all into continually empowering it while flawlessly convinced that we're fighting it. It is like a living organism, and the way it keeps itself alive is by hiding itself in the shadows of our minds, preventing us from becoming fully conscious of it. The less we recognize it, the more we unwittingly spread it, generating a powerful feedback loop from which it is nearly impossible to escape. That is where humanity finds itself now.

It is why we sometimes fear the existence of an evil global conspiracy running the world from behind the scenes.

It is entirely possible to fight evil without making things worse by using our own darkness. But to do that, there's something we must see first.

Unlike the Light, the darkness is not a real entity. It is an absence, not a presence. It is merely our willingness to turn away from our Light, instead listening to our agendas and justifications.

Yet we must never admit this to ourselves, because the whole point of this ruse is to prove that we're the good guys — and what kind of good guy would knowingly create evil?

Simply by harboring malice — whether we're conscious of it or not — we're signaling to our enemy that we're under the malevolent sway of the very thing that we're viciously judging _them_ for; and moreover, indicating that we know this, but are incapable of admitting it. We know that they will perceive this as evil — because it is the very _essence_ of evil — but we've built an airtight defense against this accusation, and so their recalcitrance only proves our point: that they are fundamentally defective, and must be stopped at any  cost. Our goal is to prove that the darkness exists only in other people, giving us something external to blame for the sorry state of the world, so that we don't have to confront our own complicity. This doesn't even require outright malice, per se. Simply by perceiving ourselves as _intrinsically_ superior to others; seeing them as _fundamentally_ defective — i.e., contempt — we set this process in motion.

This is impossibly dark behavior, and yet we never recognize it as such. Or more precisely, part of us _does_ recognize it, but we don't let this knowledge reach conscious awareness. It turns out this is the secret mechanism behind _all the evil there ever was_. "Bad people" know perfectly well when they are doing wrong, but this knowledge is carefully shielded from conscious self-reflection, so that it doesn't _feel_ wrong. In this shadowy state, we are capable of anything. The reason we hate others for it is not to expose or subdue their darkness — like we tell ourselves — but to get them to suppress it even harder while blaming it on them, making them appear even more obviously defective, so that we can better hide our own darkness from ourselves.

This is how evil spreads, with nobody recognizing their own complicity. In this state, cruelty becomes righteous, and we inevitably overlook the harmful and self-serving aspects of our own actions and agendas. This is what the darkness is ultimately trying to achieve: a world in which it has complete dominion, tricking us all into continually empowering it while flawlessly convinced that we're fighting it. It is like a living organism, keeping itself alive is by hiding itself in the shadows of our minds. When it invariably emerges, it cleverly masquerades as our inner Light. It makes us violently judge others for falling victim to this obvious trap, while preventing us from noticing that this very attitude is proof that we're caught in it ourselves. We're convinced that we're fighting evil, but our darkness is actually telegraphing itself to our enemies in order to _resonate_ with theirs, in a kind of secret handshake. We may be enemies on the surface, but under the covers, our darkness is secretly allied.

This is why we sometimes fear the existence of an evil global conspiracy running the world from behind the scenes. The darkness in our minds is indeed conspiring, together behaving like a singular _distributed malevolent entity_, manipulating all of humanity from beneath our conscious thresholds. The Christians know it as the Devil, and the Buddhists call it the ego. You can treat it as a metaphor, but it is also as real as anything you can touch. It is the _primordial_ evil conspiracy; the one to which all the rest owe their existence, and to which they ultimately filter up. The reason we never seem able to fully unveil it is that it lives deep within the crevices of our own minds. It keeps our attention fixated perpetually outward, on the evil "out there," so that we will never look "in here," at the one place where we can actually defeat it. Every attempt to subdue it externally without being free of it internally only ends up creating more, often in invisible ways. There is no way around this.

Kindness is any behavior that brings the darkness to Light, and evil is anything that hides it. Every act of unkindness is secretly an attempt to drive other people's self-deception deeper into their minds, and is therefore evil. If you are perceptive enough while behaving this way, you will discover that you somehow already knew this, but couldn't admit it to yourself. It is itself an act of profound self-deception; of hiding from your Light. This alone would have told you that it would only produce more evil, no matter how convincingly it claims otherwise. Every time any one of us makes this mistake, we unwittingly induce the same tendency in everyone else. It is _infectious_. The "trick" to remaining kind — if you can call it that — is to never depart from your inner Light under any circumstances. If there is even a trace of malice, contempt, or self-righteousness anywhere in your heart, it _will_ leak into the world — and part of you will always know it.

It is entirely possible to fight evil without making this tragic mistake. But to do that, there's something we must see first.

There can be moments in life — such as during psychedelic trips, near-death experiences, or deep meditation or prayer — when you are confronted with the full depths of your own self-deception. You are shown every single instance where you skirted your conscience in any way; every act of lying to yourself for your own personal gain. You are brought face-to-face with all the harm you've ever perpetrated since time immemorial, and it is far more than you could hope to clean up in a single lifetime. The pain is beyond what you can fathom, or think you can bear. How widely and quickly it spread! How many it affected! The darkness exploited your fear and pride, enabling you to do things you otherwise couldn't if only you had been seeing clearly.

But slowly, it dawns on you: the reason it hurts so much is that you never actually wanted to do this. It is only profound confusion that enabled it. Your then absorb your whole being into that part of you that never wanted to hurt anyone; never _could_ want such a thing. And then it happens: the full mass of darkness suddenly lifts from your mind. It feels exactly like you'd imagine being freed of a demonic possession. Beneath it is a Light so vast that it defies description; an infinite Love for all of reality that excludes nothing and forsakes no-one — including the targets of its fearsome wrath, should that be necessary. You never truly departed from your Light; never could, because you _are_ the Light — and, astonishingly, so is everyone else.

In fact, you _are_ everyone and everything else, just pretending that you're not. One consciousness, peering out through countless eyes. There are many ways to say this, all of which sound absurd to the rational mind. But when you fully unveil the Light in yourself, you automatically see it in everyone else — including those who seemed not to have any. This is what the darkness is trying to hide. Everything we do to each other — or to Nature herself — we ultimately do to ourselves. How crazy to think otherwise! How foolish to judge others for not seeing it, when we weren't able to see it yet ourselves! Such a silly game we play, with such tragic consequences. We are continually shoving other versions of ourselves into the abyss, to keep the game going, because we're not ready to wake up ourselves. We lose the desire to "get away" with anything, because the whole idea is exposed as ridiculous. The Light is _everywhere._ The sooner we own up to our misdeeds, the better for everyone.

The strangest part is discovering how you simultaneously _knew_ this and yet somehow _didn't_. You convinced yourself that your unkind behavior was "for the greater good," even as you knew better. You could always perceive the inner Light in the "bad people," and you chose to smother it anyway — knowing that if you compartmentalized this knowledge carefully enough, nobody could blame you for it, because _you yourself_ would no longer know. Yet others could somehow sense what you were doing, and it gave them a chance to pin the evils of the world on you. It is only now that you see that they were only lost in the same confusion that you were, that you are able to truly forgive them. You discover the surprising sense in which nobody actually _wants_ to harbor the darkness — or rather, how their apparent desire to harbor it is simply a reflection of our own desperate need to project our own darkness into the souls of others. We should practically thank them for accepting that role.

You see for the first time _how_ others could sense what you were really doing, despite your astonishingly clever attempts to hide it. At the very deepest level, your mind is not truly separate from theirs, or from the world at large. It's not that others can read your mind, per se, but your deepest motivations invariably weave themselves into the very fabric of your "outer" reality; the two being fundamentally inseparable. The deepest choice of all is whether to stand firm in your Light or give in to the impostor. It is a choice you make in every moment, whether you know it or not — and the cumulative result determines your ultimate impact on the world. Others can sense your choices at a subconscious level, and they subtly influence their own. Our culture has convinced itself that this is mystical nonsense, despite it being right under our noses. We do this so that we can harbor our demons while pretending this has no consequences. The more we heal, the more this worldview evaporates.

There is no way to force others to see any of this; force being a manifestation of the same fundamental mistake. Those who are most powerful at inducing this realization in others are simply those who hold it most strongly themselves. They are literally incapable of feeling malice, contempt, or self-righteousness, having thoroughly seen through them as horsemen of the darkness. Yet they are not weak. They are unafraid to fiercely confront the darkness in others. Being free of it themselves, they are immune to its charms. This enables their accusations to penetrate other minds, instead of being deflected by the defense mechanisms that the rest of us normally trigger — again, inadvertently, but in another sense, intentionally. Their attack therefore finds its mark — which is the darkness itself, and not the confused being who unwittingly harbors it — even if the being needs to be harmed in the process. This is all very difficult to describe, but part of you knows exactly what I mean. 

In the same way that your darkness can extend a secret handshake to theirs, your Light can do the same. It is nowhere near as violently pleasurable as provoking the darkness, but infinitely more valuable. This process can take a long time to unfold, and require many iterations — but it is the _only_ way that darkness is released from our world.

---

If we ultimately are the Light, how on Earth did we get to this place that looks nothing like it? This process is extremely tricky to convey, because it doesn't fit into our culture's standard metaphysics. You could say it all began with a subtle turn away from the Light. Then, fearing that we'd lost contact with our _absolute_ goodness, we went out seeking for it _relatively_ — that is, at the expense of apparent "others." We felt that we had to make them _bad_, and then violently defeat them, to earn our way back to our original goodness. But this just made things worse, and it quickly spiraled out of control. This is the apparent reality in which we now live.

The hardest thing to communicate about this story is that it does not unfold in what we normally conceive of as linear time. In a profound and surprising sense, every moment is the very first. Thus, every instant is an opportunity to rediscover our primordial Home, a place we never truly left. Each time we see this, we increasingly discover how our judgements of others are actually pointers back to an unhealed part of ourselves. As we heal ourselves, we discover how to heal our relationship with the "other," until it slowly dawns on us that there was never truly an "other." The more we see this, the more we vow to hold the Light for these seeming others, even when — indeed, _especially_ when — they cannot hold it for themselves. Far from being a burden, we discover that this has always been our true purpose; our deepest calling. Every encounter with evil becomes an opportunity to strengthen our commitment to the Light.

Looked at this way, kindness is anything that brings us all closer to remembering the truth, and evil is anything that pushes us away from it. Forsaking others is thus always a form of evil. It is a form of forsaking ourselves, because we are not ready to come Home yet. If this language feels too religious for you, feel free to find your own framing. In the end, there is only one truth anyway.

Unlike the Light, the darkness is not a real entity. It is an absence, not a presence. It is merely our willingness to turn away from our Light, instead listening to our agendas and justifications. As such, it can never be defeated by more absence. Yet make no mistake: although it is an absence, it still behaves like a sinister presence; a parasite of the mind. The darkness you see your enemies is the very _same_ entity in your mind that provokes you into seeing theirs as intrinsic. It manipulates your perception at such a fundamental level that you simply cannot fathom that you're being fooled. You're certain that you're seeing reality _as it is_. It is an _impossibly_ clever trick.

It is difficult to overstate just how much of our civilization is built on the shaky foundations of our aggregate self-deception. Every time any one of us skirts our conscience in any way, we contribute to the universal bank of darkness. Revenge fantasy films, YouTube videos of "Karens getting owned," vicious Facebook threads full of casual cruelty — each is a breeding ground for our collective demons. It all seeps into our physical reality, poisoning it. Everything from our unhealthy air, water, and soil, to our myriad societal ills and the climate crisis, is ultimately an external manifestation of a sickness within. As long as we perceive this sickness to exist only in others, we will never discover the hidden aspect of our own minds that secretly enables it, continually confusing our contempt for our authentic good. This is in no way suggesting that we are all equally complicit, by any stretch of the imagination. Nonetheless, we each have a profound role to play in leading the world back to the Light.

We've been led astray by a society that points us in precisely the wrong direction to accomplish this, although that is nobody's fault in particular. Our power does not lie in lording our superiority over others — including the "bad people" — but in discovering our surprising commonality with them. This is not some kumbaya sentiment, either. Again, genuine kindness has nothing to do with being nice. It can be fierce or even violent if necessary. It can take almost any form at all. Its only defining characteristic is that it is utterly free of self-deception. It does not misperceive evil as being intrinsic to any mind, and this seemingly-subtle change makes all the difference. The profound integrity of this act prevents the darkness in others from finding the "hook" in our own that it would normally use to justify itself, and is thereby weakened. Although we may still be enemies on the surface, our Light is becoming allied. We are beginning to remember how this whole game actually works.

To be clear: it does no good to pretend that you can see the Light in others when you can't. Doing so can backfire miserably. Thus, both pretending to see the Light and overlooking it are harmful. The only solution is to learn to actually see it, which happens naturally as you uncover your own. Similarly, it is astonishingly easy to lie to ourselves about whether our violent behavior is genuinely kind or merely self-deception. This is how the darkness sneaks in. Perhaps the clearest measure of our own ability to deceive ourselves is how much contempt we are able to muster for our enemies; the "bad people." To the degree that this potential is present, we are susceptible to sliding down the dark path that has enabled every atrocity there ever was, without ever realizing that we've done so. All that is required is the right — or wrong — confluence of circumstances. This happens faster than you can imagine, and you _do not_ want to find yourself there. You _will_ have to confront it, sooner or later.

---

There are vast and subtle networks of causality that we are normally unconscious of, and that secretly drive the fate of the world. If we pay attention only to the surface activity, we miss out on the bulk of what actually shapes our reality. Evil can look sweet and pretty, while kindness may look nothing like our naive interpretations of it. It is impossible to know which is which — and easy to convince ourselves otherwise — until we have done the deep inner work that eradicates the core confusion. We each catch glimpses from time to time, and it is our sacred duty to carry those glimpses into the world as best we are able. I wish I could tell you that I have completed the journey myself, but alas, I am a mere fledgling. I am still liable to mess things up royally, and I hope you will hold my feet to the fire when I do. I promise to do the same for you.

May all beings be free from suffering and its causes. Amen.

Kindness is the hardest word to define, but also the most important. It doesn't mean being nice. Nice means pleasant and agreeable, which can backfire in some situations. Kindness is something much more profound. It is the right motivation in literally _every_ circumstance. But how could kindness be the correct response to evil?

Our usual instinct is to be nasty to perpetrators. We may have the good sense not to be overtly cruel, but we often can't help but inject at least a _little_ bit of darkness into our interactions. We reason that as long as it produces a positive outcome — such as suppressing their misbehavior — that it's not actually dark in the first place. It _must_ be good. And what could be wrong with harboring a bit of malice or contempt in our hearts, anyway? They're private feelings with no external effect. But part of us knows this story is a sham. Something in us is secretly trying to _provoke_ their darkness. We tell ourselves that we're just exposing the darkness already there, for all the world to see, but the truth is that we are knowingly driving it deeper _into_ their minds, thereby birthing new evil into the world. Yet we must never admit this to ourselves, because the whole point of this ruse is to prove that we're the good guys — and what kind of good guy would knowingly create evil?

The most fascinating part is _how_ we drive the darkness deeper in. Simply by harboring malice — whether we're conscious of it or not — we're signaling to our enemy that we're under the malevolent sway of the very thing that we're viciously judging _them_ for; and moreover, indicating that we know this, but are incapable of admitting it. We know that they will perceive this as evil — because it is the very _essence_ of evil — but we've built an airtight defense against this accusation, and so their recalcitrance only proves our point: that they are fundamentally defective, and must be stopped at any  cost.

This doesn't even require outright malice, per se.

I wish I could tell you that I have completed the journey myself, but alas, I am a mere fledgling. I am still liable to mess things up royally, and I hope you will hold my feet to the fire when I do. I promise to do the same for you.

May all beings be free from suffering and its causes. Amen.

Kindness is the hardest word to define, but also the most important. It doesn't mean being nice. Nice means pleasant and agreeable; fine qualities that are nonetheless unhelpful sometimes. Kindness means something much more profound. It is the right motivation in literally _every_ circumstance. But how could kindness be the correct response to evil?

---

Our usual instinct is to be nasty to perpetrators. We may have the good sense not to be overtly cruel, but we often can't help but inject at least a _little_ bit of darkness into our interactions. We reason that as long as it produces a positive outcome — such as suppressing their misbehavior — that it's not really dark in the first place. It must therefore be good. And what could be wrong with harboring a bit of malice or contempt in our hearts, anyway? They're private feelings with no external effect. But part of us knows this story is a sham. Something in us is secretly trying to _provoke_ the darkness in our enemies. We tell ourselves that we're just exposing the evil already there, for all the world to see, but the truth is that we are knowingly driving it deeper _into_ their minds, thereby birthing new evil into the world. Yet we must never admit this to ourselves, because the whole point of this ruse is to prove that we're the good guys — and what kind of good guy would knowingly create evil?

The fascinating part is _how_ we drive the darkness deeper in. Simply by harboring malice — whether we're conscious of it or not — we're signaling to our enemy that we're under the malevolent sway of the very thing that we're viciously judging _them_ for; and moreover, that we _know_ this, but are incapable of admitting it. We're secretly inviting them to perceive us as evil — but we've built an airtight defense against this accusation, and so it only proves our point: that they must be _fundamentally_ defective, and must be stopped at any cost. Our hidden goal is to prove that the darkness exists only in other people, so that we have something external to blame for the sorry state of the world, and don't have to confront our own complicity. This doesn't even require outright malice, per se. Simply by perceiving ourselves as _intrinsically_ superior to others; seeing them as _fundamentally_ defective — i.e., contempt — we set this process in motion.

This is impossibly dark behavior, and yet we never recognize it as such. Or more precisely, part of us _does_ recognize it, but we don't let this knowledge reach conscious awareness. It turns out this is the secret mechanism behind _all the evil there ever was_. "Bad people" know perfectly well when they are doing wrong, but this knowledge is carefully shielded from conscious self-reflection, so that it doesn't _feel_ wrong. In this shadowy state, we are capable of anything. The reason we hate others for it is not to expose or subdue their darkness — like we tell ourselves — but to get them to suppress it even harder while blaming it on them, making them appear even more obviously defective, so that we can better hide our own darkness from ourselves.

This is how evil spreads, with nobody recognizing their own complicity. In this state, cruelty becomes righteous, and we inevitably overlook the harmful and self-serving aspects of our own actions and agendas. This is what the darkness is ultimately trying to achieve: a world in which it has complete dominion, tricking us all into continually empowering it while flawlessly convinced that we're fighting it. It is like a living organism, keeping itself alive is by hiding itself in the shadows of our minds. When it invariably emerges, it cleverly masquerades as our inner Light. It makes us violently judge others for falling victim to this obvious trap, while preventing us from noticing that this very attitude is proof that we're caught in it ourselves. We're convinced that we're fighting evil, but our darkness is actually telegraphing itself to our enemies in order to _resonate_ with theirs, in a kind of secret handshake. We may be enemies on the surface, but under the covers, our darkness is secretly allied.

This is why we sometimes fear the existence of an evil global conspiracy running the world from behind the scenes. The darkness in our minds is indeed conspiring, together behaving like a singular _distributed malevolent entity_, manipulating all of humanity from beneath our conscious thresholds. The Christians know it as the Devil, and the Buddhists call it the ego. You can treat it as a metaphor, but it is also as real as anything you can touch. It is the _primordial_ evil conspiracy; the one to which all the rest owe their existence, and to which they ultimately filter up. The reason we never seem able to fully unveil it is that it lives deep within the crevices of our own minds. It keeps our attention fixated perpetually outward, on the evil "out there," so that we will never look "in here," at the one place where we can actually defeat it. Every attempt to subdue it externally without being free of it internally only ends up creating more, often in invisible ways. There is no way around this.

Kindness is any behavior that brings the darkness to Light, and evil is anything that hides it. Every act of unkindness is secretly an attempt to drive other people's self-deception deeper into their minds, and is therefore evil. If you are perceptive enough while behaving this way, you will discover that you somehow already knew this, but couldn't admit it to yourself. It is itself an act of profound self-deception; of hiding from your Light. This alone would have told you that it would only produce more evil, no matter how convincingly it claims otherwise. Every time any one of us makes this mistake, we unwittingly induce the same tendency in everyone else. It is _infectious_. The "trick" to remaining kind — if you can call it that — is to never depart from your inner Light under any circumstances. If there is even a trace of malice, contempt, or self-righteousness anywhere in your heart, it _will_ leak into the world — and part of you will always know it.

It is entirely possible to fight evil without making this tragic mistake. But to do that, there's something we must see first.

---

There can be moments in life — such as during psychedelic trips, near-death experiences, or deep meditation or prayer — when you are confronted with the full depths of your own self-deception. You are shown every single instance where you skirted your conscience in any way; every act of lying to yourself for your own personal gain. You are brought face-to-face with all the harm you've ever perpetrated since time immemorial, and it is far more than you could hope to clean up in a single lifetime. The pain is beyond what you can fathom, or think you can bear. How widely and quickly it spread! How many it affected! The darkness exploited your fear and pride, enabling you to do things you otherwise couldn't if only you had been seeing clearly.

But slowly, it dawns on you: the reason it hurts so much is that you never actually wanted to do this. It is only profound confusion that enabled it. Your then absorb your whole being into that part of you that never wanted to hurt anyone; never _could_ want such a thing. And then it happens: the full mass of darkness suddenly lifts from your mind. It feels exactly like you'd imagine being freed of a demonic possession. Beneath it is a Light so vast that it defies description; an infinite Love for all of reality that excludes nothing and forsakes no-one — including the targets of its fearsome wrath, should that be necessary. You never truly departed from your Light; never could, because you _are_ the Light — and, astonishingly, so is everyone else.

In fact, you _are_ everyone and everything else, just pretending that you're not. One consciousness, peering out through countless eyes. There are many ways to say this, all of which sound absurd to the rational mind. But when you fully unveil the Light in yourself, you automatically see it in everyone else — including those who seemed not to have any. This is what the darkness is trying to hide. Everything we do to each other — or to Nature herself — we ultimately do to ourselves. How crazy to think otherwise! How foolish to judge others for not seeing it, when we weren't able to see it yet ourselves! Such a silly game we play, with such tragic consequences. We are continually shoving other versions of ourselves into the abyss, to keep the game going, because we're not ready to wake up ourselves. We lose the desire to "get away" with anything, because the whole idea is exposed as ridiculous. The Light is _everywhere._ The sooner we own up to our misdeeds, the better for everyone.

The strangest part is discovering how you simultaneously _knew_ this and yet somehow _didn't_. You convinced yourself that your unkind behavior was "for the greater good," even as you knew better. You could always perceive the inner Light in the "bad people," and you chose to smother it anyway — knowing that if you compartmentalized this knowledge carefully enough, nobody could blame you for it, because _you yourself_ would no longer know. Yet others could somehow sense what you were doing, and it gave them a chance to pin the evils of the world on you. It is only now that you see that they were only lost in the same confusion that you were, that you are able to truly forgive them. You discover the surprising sense in which nobody actually _wants_ to harbor the darkness — or rather, how their apparent desire to harbor it is simply a reflection of our own desperate need to project our own darkness into the souls of others. We should practically thank them for accepting that role.

You see for the first time _how_ others could sense what you were really doing, despite your astonishingly clever attempts to hide it. At the very deepest level, your mind is not truly separate from theirs, or from the world at large. It's not that others can read your mind, per se, but your deepest motivations invariably weave themselves into the very fabric of your "outer" reality; the two being fundamentally inseparable. The deepest choice of all is whether to stand firm in your Light or give in to the impostor. It is a choice you make in every moment, whether you know it or not — and the cumulative result determines your ultimate impact on the world. Others can sense your choices at a subconscious level, and they subtly influence their own. Our culture has convinced itself that this is mystical nonsense, despite it being right under our noses. We do this so that we can harbor our demons while pretending this has no consequences. The more we heal, the more this worldview evaporates.

There is no way to force others to see any of this; force being a manifestation of the same fundamental mistake. Those who are most powerful at inducing this realization in others are simply those who hold it most strongly themselves. They are literally incapable of feeling malice, contempt, or self-righteousness, having thoroughly seen through them as horsemen of the darkness. Yet they are not weak. They are unafraid to fiercely confront the darkness in others. Being free of it themselves, they are immune to its charms. This enables their accusations to penetrate other minds, instead of being deflected by the defense mechanisms that the rest of us normally trigger — again, inadvertently, but in another sense, intentionally. Their attack therefore finds its mark — which is the darkness itself, and not the confused being who unwittingly harbors it — even if the being needs to be harmed in the process. This is all very difficult to describe, but part of you knows exactly what I mean. 

In the same way that your darkness can extend a secret handshake to theirs, your Light can do the same. It is nowhere near as violently pleasurable as provoking the darkness, but infinitely more valuable. This process can take a long time to unfold, and require many iterations — but it is the _only_ way that darkness is released from our world.

---

If we ultimately are the Light, how on Earth did we get to this place that looks nothing like it? This process is extremely tricky to convey, because it doesn't fit into our culture's standard metaphysics. You could say it all began with a subtle turn away from the Light. Then, fearing that we'd lost contact with our _absolute_ goodness, we went out seeking for it _relatively_ — that is, at the expense of apparent "others." We felt that we had to make them _bad_, and then violently defeat them, to earn our way back to our original goodness. But this just made things worse, and it quickly spiraled out of control. This is the apparent reality in which we now live.

The hardest thing to communicate about this story is that it does not unfold in what we normally conceive of as linear time. In a profound and surprising sense, every moment is the very first. Thus, every instant is an opportunity to rediscover our primordial Home, a place we never truly left. Each time we see this, we increasingly discover how our judgements of others are actually pointers back to an unhealed part of ourselves. As we heal ourselves, we discover how to heal our relationship with the "other," until it slowly dawns on us that there was never truly an "other." The more we see this, the more we vow to hold the Light for these seeming others, even when — indeed, _especially_ when — they cannot hold it for themselves. Far from being a burden, we discover that this has always been our true purpose; our deepest calling. Every encounter with evil becomes an opportunity to strengthen our commitment to the Light.

Looked at this way, kindness is anything that brings us all closer to remembering the truth, and evil is anything that pushes us away from it. Forsaking others is thus always a form of evil. It is a form of forsaking ourselves, because we are not ready to come Home yet. If this language feels too religious for you, feel free to find your own framing. In the end, there is only one truth anyway.

---

Unlike the Light, the darkness is not a real entity. It is an absence, not a presence. It is merely our willingness to turn away from our Light, instead listening to our agendas and justifications. As such, it can never be defeated by more absence. Yet make no mistake: although it is an absence, it still behaves like a sinister presence; a parasite of the mind. The darkness you see your enemies is the very _same_ entity in your mind that provokes you into seeing theirs as intrinsic. It manipulates your perception at such a fundamental level that you simply cannot fathom that you're being fooled. You're certain that you're seeing reality _as it is_. It is an _impossibly_ clever trick.

It is difficult to overstate just how much of our civilization is built on the shaky foundations of our aggregate self-deception. Every time any one of us skirts our conscience in any way, we contribute to the universal bank of darkness. Revenge fantasy films, YouTube videos of "Karens getting owned," vicious Facebook threads full of casual cruelty — each is a breeding ground for our collective demons. It all seeps into our physical reality, poisoning it. Everything from our unhealthy air, water, and soil, to our myriad societal ills and the climate crisis, is ultimately an external manifestation of a sickness within. As long as we perceive this sickness to exist only in others, we will never discover the hidden aspect of our own minds that secretly enables it, continually confusing our contempt for our authentic good. This is in no way suggesting that we are all equally complicit, by any stretch of the imagination. Nonetheless, we each have a profound role to play in leading the world back to the Light.

We've been led astray by a society that points us in precisely the wrong direction to accomplish this, although that is nobody's fault in particular. Our power does not lie in lording our superiority over others — including the "bad people" — but in discovering our surprising commonality with them. This is not some kumbaya sentiment, either. Again, genuine kindness has nothing to do with being nice. It can be fierce or even violent if necessary. It can take almost any form at all. Its only defining characteristic is that it is utterly free of self-deception. It does not misperceive evil as being intrinsic to any mind, and this seemingly-subtle change makes all the difference. The profound integrity of this act prevents the darkness in others from finding the "hook" in our own that it would normally use to justify itself, and is thereby weakened. Although we may still be enemies on the surface, our Light is becoming allied. We are beginning to remember how this whole game actually works.

To be clear: it does no good to pretend that you can see the Light in others when you can't. Doing so can backfire miserably. Thus, both pretending to see the Light and overlooking it are harmful. The only solution is to learn to actually see it, which happens naturally as you uncover your own. Similarly, it is astonishingly easy to lie to ourselves about whether our violent behavior is genuinely kind or merely self-deception. This is how the darkness sneaks in. Perhaps the clearest measure of our own ability to deceive ourselves is how much contempt we are able to muster for our enemies; the "bad people." To the degree that this potential is present, we are susceptible to sliding down the dark path that has enabled every atrocity there ever was, without ever realizing that we've done so. All that is required is the right — or wrong — confluence of circumstances. This happens faster than you can imagine, and you _do not_ want to find yourself there. You _will_ have to confront it, sooner or later.

---

Everything you do makes a difference, in ways that you can hardly fathom. There are vast and subtle networks of causality that we are normally unconscious of, and that secretly drive the fate of the world. If we pay attention only to the surface activity, we miss out on the bulk of what actually shapes our reality. Evil can look sweet and pretty, while kindness may look nothing like our naive interpretations of it. It is impossible to know which is which — and easy to convince ourselves otherwise — until we have done the deep inner work that eradicates the core confusion. We each catch glimpses from time to time, and it is our duty to carry those glimpses into the world as best we are able. I wish I could tell you that I have completed the journey myself, but alas, I am a mere fledgling. I am still liable to mess things up royally, and I hope you will hold my feet to the fire when I do. I promise to do the same for you.

May all beings be free from suffering and its causes. Amen.

Kindness is the hardest word to define, but also the most important. It doesn't mean being nice. Nice means pleasant and agreeable, which are fine qualities in most everyday situations.

Fighting evil certainly requires being fierce — but there's a fine line between that and being cruel. Fierceness can actually accomplish its goal, but cruelty is something else entirely. Its secret purpose is to create _more_ evil in the world while giving us plausible deniability. It feels like we're righteously attacking the darkness in our enemy's mind; violently punishing it, but this behavior is liable to make our target commit _more_ evil, using our cruelty as justification — which will of course require us to punish them more, etc., in a never-ending cycle. What's secretly happening is that the darkness in our own mind is powerfully conveying itself to our enemy, driving theirs deeper _into_ their mind, while convincing us both that we're valiantly fighting it.

It is impossible to overstate just how insidious and pervasive this dynamic is. We all believe that we'd recognize it if we were perpetrating it ourselves, but the whole reason it works is that it's insanely well hidden from our conscious minds. We mock, shame, and contemptuously judge our enemies, telling ourselves that this is harmless behavior, or even helpful. It's certainly not _cruel_, at any rate — especially because we've given them fair warning of what would happen if they didn't stop. But the truth is, something in our mind is constantly searching for excuses to unleash hell — and so it continually provokes the "bad people," hoping to bait them into misbehavior that we can use to prove that we were right about them, and left with no choice.

Again, we never realize that we're doing this, because if we did, the whole ruse would fall apart. The whole point is to provoke them in a way that makes it obviously their fault, because only then can we use it as justification to escalate. So we do it in exceptionally clever and subtle ways that even _we_ don't recognize as such. The more we do this, the more we overlook the harmful and self-serving aspects of our own actions and agendas — and _this_ is evil's secret endgame. The more the darkness can get us to believe that it only exists _out there,_ the more it gets us to ignore what is happening _in here,_ and the more liable we are to powerfully spread it while flawlessly convinced that we're fighting it. This is how evil gains dominion over our world.

Do we know that we're abetting it? Yes and no. The knowledge exists in a kind of limbo state. It is entirely accessible to our conscious minds, but it is disguised in such an astonishingly clever way that we never recognize it. The feeling we carry around is simply that of being on a noble mission to valiantly defeat the evil "out there," never noticing that this very attitude is an unmistakable sign that we ourselves are deeply infected, and virulently spreading that infection. But others _do_ notice this — if only subconsciously — and it invites them to contemptuously judge _us,_ which of course only increases our conviction that we're the victims, and must fight even harder. In other words, simply _carrying_ the infection is itself enough to spread it.

This is the secret mechanism behind _all the evil there ever was._ "Bad people" know perfectly well that they're doing wrong, but this knowledge is carefully shielded from conscious self-reflection, so that it doesn't _feel_ wrong. All they hear are their own clever justifications. A deep part of us recognizes that they're caught in a trap that we ourselves are susceptible to, and it even knows how to fight their evil in a way that actually works — but another part sees this as a golden opportunity. By perceiving them as _fundamentally defective_, we can use them as justification to push forward our own self-serving agendas without recognizing them as such. In this state, we literally cannot perceive anything selfish about our plans; they're simply necessary.

Thus, the vast majority of evil looks nothing like it does in the movies. It mostly consists of people justifying subtly self-interested behaviors that are wrapped up in magnificent garb that makes them appear noble, even to themselves. Yet every such act of self-deception, from the tiniest act of unkindness to the most bone-chilling atrocity, ultimately stems from the same principle — and every time any one of us engages in it, we secretly reinforce that capacity in everyone else. Over time, all this self-deception accumulates, resulting in the great evils of our world. It does not matter who feel contempt _for_; simply feeling it always empowers humanity's ultimate foe. There is but _one_ darkness, though it manifests itself through countless channels.

This is why we sometimes suspect the existence of an evil global conspiracy running the world from behind the scenes. The darkness in our minds is indeed conspiring, behaving more like a singular _distributed malevolent entity_, manipulating all of humanity from beneath our conscious thresholds. The Christians know it as the Devil, and the Buddhists call it the ego. You can treat it as a metaphor, but it is also as real as anything you can touch. It is the _primordial_ evil conspiracy; the one to which all the rest owe their existence, and to which they ultimately filter up. It keeps our attention fixated perpetually outward, on the evil "out there," so that we will never look "in here," at the one place where we can actually defeat it. Every attempt to subdue it externally without being free of it internally only ends up creating more, usually in invisible ways. It doesn't matter how cleverly we've proven that an agendas is for the greater good: as long as this principle is operating, it can _only_ spread darkness.

How do we know if it is operating? The most sure sign is the presence of malice, contempt, or self-righteousness. If we harbor even the faintest sense that we are _intrinsically_ superior to our enemies, or that they are _fundamentally_ defective, then it is only our darkness masquerading as our Light. We could say that kindness is any behavior that is free from this self-deception. Only from this place can the darkness actually be fought. But to understand how, there is something we must see first.

Again, genuine kindness has nothing to do with being nice. It can be fierce or even violent if necessary. It can take almost any form at all. Its only defining characteristic is that it is utterly free of self-deception. It does not misperceive evil as being intrinsic to any mind, and this seemingly-subtle change makes all the difference. The profound integrity of this act prevents the darkness in others from finding the "hook" in our own that it would normally use to justify itself, and is thereby weakened. Although we may still be enemies on the surface, our Light is becoming allied. We are beginning to remember how this whole game actually works.

To be clear: it does no good to pretend that you can see the Light in others when you can't. Doing so can backfire miserably. Thus, both pretending to see the Light and overlooking it are harmful. The only solution is to learn to actually see it, which happens naturally as you uncover your own. Similarly, it is astonishingly easy to lie to ourselves about whether our violent behavior is radical kindness or merely self-deception. This is how the darkness sneaks in. Perhaps the clearest measure of our own ability to deceive ourselves is how much contempt we are able to muster for our enemies; the "bad people." To the degree that this potential is present, we are susceptible to sliding down the dark path that has enabled every atrocity there ever was, without ever realizing that we've done so. All that is required is the right — or wrong — confluence of circumstances. This happens faster than you can imagine, and you _do not_ want to find yourself there. You _will_ have to confront it, sooner or later.

Everything you do makes a difference, in ways that you can hardly fathom. There are vast and subtle networks of causality that we are normally unconscious of, and that secretly drive the fate of the world. If we pay attention only to the surface activity, we miss out on the bulk of what actually shapes our reality. Evil can look sweet and pretty, while kindness may look nothing like our naive interpretations of it. It is impossible to know which is which — and easy to convince ourselves otherwise — until we have done the deep inner work that eradicates the core confusion. We each catch glimpses from time to time, and it is our duty to carry those glimpses into the world as best we are able. I wish I could tell you that I have completed the journey myself, but alas, I am a mere fledgling. I am still liable to mess things up royally, and I hope you will hold my feet to the fire when I do. I promise to do the same for you.

May all beings be free from suffering and its causes. Amen.

Kindness is the hardest word to define, but also the most important. It doesn't mean being nice. Nice means pleasant and agreeable, which are fine qualities in most normal situations but useless in others. Kindness, on the other hand, means something much more profound. It is the right orientation in literally _every_ circumstance. But how could kindness be the right response to evil?

---

Fighting evil certainly requires being fierce — but there's a fine line between fierce and cruel. Fierceness can actually accomplish its goal, but cruelty is something else entirely. Its hidden purpose is to create _more_ evil in the world while giving us plausible deniability. It feels like we're viciously attacking the darkness in our enemy's mind; righteously punishing it, but something in us knows that our behavior is liable to make them commit _more_ evil, using our cruelty as justification — which will force us to punish them harder, etc., in a never-ending cycle. What's secretly happening is that the darkness in our own mind is using theirs as an excuse to unleash itself under noble pretenses, and theirs is responding in kind. It is like a secret handshake between our darkness and theirs; one that you can learn to sense.

It is impossible to overstate just how insidious and pervasive this dynamic is. We all believe we'd recognize if we were perpetrating it ourselves, but the whole reason it works so well is that it's incredibly well hidden from our conscious minds. The vast majority of such behavior looks nothing like overt cruelty. We mock, shame, and contemptuously judge our enemies, convinced that this is harmless or even helpful behavior. It's a far cry from _cruelty_, at any rate — especially because they earned it — but exactly the same dynamic is at work. Simply by perceiving ourselves as _intrinsically superior_ to others, we are telegraphing a fundamentally malicious attitude whose secret purpose is to provoke their dark side, so that we can justify even more self-righteous indignation.

We never realize that we're doing this, because if we did, the whole ruse would fall apart. The whole point is to justify our perception of ourselves as the _good guys_ and them as the _bad guys_ — and what kind of "good guy" would knowingly drive evil deeper into the minds of their enemies for their own benefit? So we hide this knowledge so carefully that even _we_ don't know that we're doing it. In this darkened state, we increasingly overlook the harmful and self-serving aspects of our own actions and agendas — and _this_ is evil's secret endgame. It's creating a world in which each of us is so convinced that the darkness exists only _out there_, that we never notice its insidious operation _in here._ Instead, we use it to justify our own selfish behavior — which we never recognize as such, convinced that we're only fighting evil.

The devil on our shoulders doesn't just whisper obviously-bad ideas in our ears; no, it alters our very perception so that we have no idea that we're obeying it. Or rather, part of us knows, but that knowledge is carefully hidden from our conscious minds, so that we convincingly pretend _not_ to know. We all know that our enemies do this, but by its very nature, we don't recognize it in ourselves — or, when we do, we easily forgive it. We walk around feeling like good people on a noble mission to valiantly defeat the evil "out there," never noticing that this very attitude is an irrefutable sign that we ourselves are infected. But others _do_ notice this — if only subconsciously — and it invites them to hate us for it, which only increases our conviction that we're the good guys, and must fight even harder. 

This is the secret mechanism behind _all the evil there ever was._ "Bad people" know perfectly well that they're doing wrong, but this knowledge is carefully shielded from conscious self-reflection, so that it doesn't _feel_ wrong. All they hear are their own clever justifications. A deep part of us recognizes that they're caught in the same trap that we're ensnared in, but another part senses that this a golden opportunity. By perceiving them as _fundamentally defective_, we license ourselves to treat them in ways that _deepen_ their self-deception while convinced that we're doing no such thing — after all, they're already as deep as they could go.

Thus, the vast majority of evil looks nothing like it does in the movies. It mostly consists of people justifying selfish behaviors wrapped up in magnificent garb that makes them appear noble, even to themselves. Yet every act of evil, from the tiniest unkindness to the most bone-chilling atrocity, ultimately depends on the very same principle — and every time any one of us engages in it, we secretly reinforce that capacity in everyone else. Every time we skirt our conscience, we license others to do the same, which we can then judge them for. Over time, this self-deception accumulates into the form of the  great evils of our world. It does not matter who feel contempt _for_; simply feeling it empowers humanity's ultimate foe. There is but _one_ darkness, and it manifests itself through countless guises.

This is why we sometimes suspect the existence of an evil global conspiracy running the world from behind the scenes. The darkness in our minds is indeed conspiring, behaving like a singular _distributed malevolent entity_, manipulating all of humanity from beneath our conscious thresholds. The Christians know it as the Devil, and the Buddhists call it the ego. You can treat it as a metaphor, but it is also as real as anything you can touch. It is the _primordial_ evil conspiracy; the one to which all the rest owe their existence, and to which they ultimately filter up. It keeps our attention fixated perpetually outward, on the evil "out there," so that we will never look "in here," at the one place where we can actually defeat it. Every attempt to subdue it externally without being free of it internally only ends up creating more, usually in invisible ways.

How do we know if it is operating in us? The most sure sign is the presence of malice, contempt, or self-righteousness. If we harbor even the faintest sense that we are _intrinsically_ superior to our enemies; that they are _fundamentally_ defective, then we are unknowingly caught in its sway. We could say that kindness is any behavior that is free from this self-deception. It is only from this place that darkness can actually be fought. But entering this place is not all rainbows and sunshine.

---

There can be moments in life — such as during psychedelic trips, near-death experiences, or deep meditation or prayer — when you are confronted with the full depths of your own self-deception. You are shown every single instance where you skirted your conscience; every act of lying to yourself for your own personal gain. You are brought face-to-face with all the harm you've ever perpetrated since time immemorial, and it is far more than you could hope to clean up in a single lifetime. The pain is beyond what you can fathom; more than you think you can bear. How widely and quickly it spread! How many it affected! The darkness exploited your fear and pride, enabling you to do things you otherwise couldn't if only you had been seeing clearly.

But slowly, it dawns on you: the reason it hurts so much is that you never actually wanted to do any of this. It is only profound confusion that enabled it. Your whole being is then absorbed into that part of you that never wanted to hurt anyone; never _could_ want such a thing. And then it happens: the full mass of darkness is suddenly lifted from your mind. It feels exactly like you'd imagine being freed of a demonic possession. Beneath it is a Light so vast that it defies description; an infinite Love for all of reality that excludes nothing and forsakes no-one. You never truly departed from this Light; indeed, never could, because it turns out you _are_ the Light — and, astonishingly, so is everyone else.

You ultimately _are_ everyone and everything else, just pretending that you're not. One consciousness, peering out through countless eyes. There are many ways to say this, all of which sound absurd to the rational mind. But when you fully unveil the Light in yourself, you automatically see it in everyone else — including those who seemed not to have any. This is what the darkness is trying to hide. Everything we do to each other — or to Nature herself — we ultimately do to ourselves. How crazy to think otherwise! How foolish to judge others for not seeing it, when we weren't able to see it yet ourselves! Such a silly game we play, with such tragic consequences. We are continually shoving each other into the abyss to keep the game going, because we're not ready to wake up ourselves. Seeing this, we lose the desire to "get away" with anything. Why would we want to hide from the Light? How did we ever think we could? The sooner we see this, the better for everyone.

The strangest part is discovering how you simultaneously _knew_ this and yet somehow _didn't_. You convinced yourself that your unkind behavior was "for the greater good," even as you knew better. You could always perceive the inner Light in the "bad people," and you chose to smother it anyway — knowing that if you compartmentalized this knowledge carefully enough, nobody could blame you for it, because _you yourself_ would no longer know. Yet others could somehow sense what you were doing, and it gave them an excuse to pin the evils of the world on you. It is only now that you see how they were only lost in the same confusion that you were, that you are able to truly forgive them. You discover the surprising sense in which nobody actually _wants_ to harbor the darkness — or rather, how their apparent desire to harbor it is simply a reflection of our own desperate need to externalize our own. We should practically thank them for becoming the scapegoats that we needed.

You see for the first time _how_ others could sense what you were really doing, despite your astonishingly clever attempts to hide it. At the very deepest level, your mind is not truly separate from theirs, or from the world at large. It's not that others can read your mind, per se, but your deepest motivations inevitably weave themselves into the fabric of your "outer" reality; the two being fundamentally inseparable. The deepest choice of all is whether to stand firm in your Light or give in to the impostor. It is a choice you make in every moment, whether you know it or not — and the cumulative result determines your ultimate impact on the world. Others can sense your choices at a subconscious level, and these subtly influence their own. Our culture has convinced itself that this is mystical nonsense, despite it being right under our noses. We do this so that we can harbor our demons while pretending this has no consequences. The more we heal as a species, the more this worldview evaporates.

There is no way to force others to see any of this; force being a manifestation of the same fundamental mistake. Those who are most powerful at inducing this realization in others are simply those who hold it most strongly themselves. They are literally incapable of feeling malice, contempt, or self-righteousness, having thoroughly seen through them as horsemen of the darkness. Yet they are not weak. They are unafraid to fiercely confront the darkness in others. Being free of darkness themselves, they are immune to its charms. This enables their accusations to penetrate other minds, instead of being deflected by the defense mechanisms that the rest of us unwittingly trigger. Their attack therefore finds its mark — which is the darkness itself, and not the confused being who unwittingly harbors it — even if the being needs to be harmed in the process. This is all very difficult to describe, but part of you knows exactly what I mean. 

In the same way that your darkness can extend a secret handshake to theirs, your Light can do the same. It is nowhere near as violently pleasurable as provoking the darkness, but infinitely more valuable. This process can take a long time to unfold, and require many iterations — but it is the _only_ way that darkness is released from our world.

---

If we ultimately are the Light, how on Earth did we get to this place that looks nothing like it? This process is extremely tricky to convey, because it doesn't fit into our culture's standard metaphysics. You could say it all began with a subtle turn away from the Light. Then, fearing that we'd lost contact with our _absolute_ goodness, we went out seeking for it _relatively_ — that is, at the expense of apparent "others." We felt that we had to make them _bad_, and then violently defeat them, to earn our way back to our original goodness. But this just made things worse, and it quickly spiraled out of control. This is the apparent reality in which we now live.

The hardest thing to communicate about this story is that it does not unfold in what we normally conceive of as linear time. In a profound and surprising sense, every moment is the very first. Thus, every instant is an opportunity to rediscover our primordial Home, a place we never truly left. Each time we see this, we increasingly discover how our judgements of others are actually pointers back to an unhealed part of ourselves. As we heal ourselves, we discover how to heal our relationship with the "other," until it slowly dawns on us that there was never truly an "other." The more we see this, the more we vow to hold the Light for these seeming others, even when — indeed, _especially_ when — they cannot hold it for themselves. Far from being a burden, we discover that this has always been our true purpose; our deepest calling. Every encounter with evil becomes an opportunity to strengthen our commitment to the Light.

Looked at this way, kindness is anything that brings us all closer to remembering the truth, and evil is anything that pushes us away from it. Forsaking others is thus always a form of evil. It is a form of forsaking ourselves, because we are not ready to come Home yet. If this language feels too religious for you, feel free to find your own framing. In the end, there is only one truth anyway.

---

Unlike the Light, the darkness is not a real entity. It is an absence, not a presence. It is merely our willingness to turn away from our Light, instead listening to our agendas and justifications. As such, it can never be defeated by more absence. Yet make no mistake: although it is an absence, it still behaves like a sinister presence; a parasite of the mind. The darkness you see your enemies is the very _same_ entity in your mind that provokes you into seeing theirs as intrinsic. It manipulates your perception at such a fundamental level that you simply cannot fathom that you're being fooled. You're certain that you're seeing reality _as it is_. It is an _impossibly_ clever trick.

It is difficult to overstate just how much of our civilization is built on the shaky foundations of our aggregate self-deception. Every time any one of us skirts our conscience in any way, we contribute to the universal bank of darkness. Revenge fantasy films, YouTube videos of "Karens getting owned," vicious Facebook threads full of casual cruelty — each is a breeding ground for our collective demons. It all seeps into our physical reality, poisoning it. Everything from our unhealthy air, water, and soil, to our myriad societal ills and the climate crisis, is ultimately an external manifestation of a sickness within. As long as we perceive this sickness to exist only in others, we will never discover the hidden aspect of our own minds that secretly enables it, continually confusing our contempt for our authentic good. This is in no way suggesting that we are all equally complicit, by any stretch of the imagination. Nonetheless, we each have a profound role to play in leading the world back to the Light.

We've been led astray by a society that points us in precisely the wrong direction to accomplish this, although that is nobody's fault in particular. Our power does not lie in lording our superiority over others — including the "bad people" — but in discovering our surprising commonality with them. This is not some kumbaya sentiment, either. Again, genuine kindness has nothing to do with being nice. It can be fierce or even violent if necessary. It can take almost any form at all. Its only defining characteristic is that it is utterly free of self-deception. It does not misperceive evil as being intrinsic to any mind, and this seemingly-subtle change makes all the difference. The profound integrity of this act prevents the darkness in others from finding the "hook" in our own that it would normally use to justify itself, and is thereby weakened. Although we may still be enemies on the surface, our Light is becoming allied. We are beginning to remember how this whole game actually works.

To be clear: it does no good to pretend that you can see the Light in others when you can't. Doing so can backfire miserably. Thus, both pretending to see the Light and overlooking it are harmful. The only solution is to learn to actually see it, which happens naturally as you uncover your own. Similarly, it is astonishingly easy to lie to ourselves about whether our violent behavior is radical kindness or merely self-deception. This is how the darkness sneaks in. Perhaps the clearest measure of our own ability to deceive ourselves is how much contempt we are able to muster for our enemies; the "bad people." To the degree that this potential is present, we are susceptible to sliding down the dark path that has enabled every atrocity there ever was, without ever realizing that we've done so.

================================


We think that hating "bad people" is a sign of the good within us, but it's actually a sign of something much darker.

People are only able to cause harm due to a particular kind of self-deception. Part of them knows perfectly well that they are doing wrong, but this knowledge is carefully shielded from conscious self-reflection, so that it doesn't _feel_ wrong. All they consciously hear are their own clever justifications. It is a state of profound delusion; one that we rightly abhor — but the truth is that every one of us knows this state intimately well ourselves. We have all skirted our conscience before, pretending either that we couldn't hear it or that we didn't have to listen. Part of us knew exactly what we were doing, but we couldn't quite admit it to ourselves. Our examples may differ in degree, but not in kind.

When we encounter another person in this state, we somehow don't recognize a fellow human in the grip of a powerful self-deception that we ourselves are highly susceptible to; no, we see them as _fundamentally morally defective_ — as though the "badness" is somehow _intrinsic_ to their minds. But this is an illusion. What's actually happening is that the darkness in our own mind is luring us into seeing them this way, so that we will viciously attack them for it. This will drive the darkness deeper _into_ their minds while giving us plausible deniability. After all, we were only trying to _fight_ evil. If they became worse as a result, it can only be evidence that we were right about them after all: they are indeed _fundamentally_ defective, and must be stopped at any cost.

This is why we enjoy mocking, shaming, and contemptuously judging our enemies; the "bad people." Simply by pretending to be _fundamentally superior_ to them, we are telegraphing to them that we are under the sway of the very self-deception that we are viciously judging _them_ for. This makes them see us as evil for precisely the same reason we see _them_ that way — and not by accident. The darkness in our mind is extending a kind of "secret handshake" to theirs; a tacit agreement to keep this world bound in darkness while leaving us humans none the wiser. We may be enemies on the surface, but under the covers, our darkness is secretly allied — because the darker the world gets, the less we realize that we're harboring it, thus causing us to unwittingly intensify the process.

This is an _incredibly_ difficult thing to admit to oneself. Any time we feel even a trace of malice, contempt, or self-righteousness toward _anyone_ for _any reason_, our mind is secretly plotting a course to darken the world without our conscious knowledge — and it always finds a way to do so. But this knowledge isn't technically unconscious. It is completely accessible to our conscious mind, but we somehow choose not to notice it. This choice to engage in self-deception is _infectious_. It invites others to engage in their own unique forms of it. If you can only learn to see the part of you that already knows this, you will suddenly understand the secret mechanism behind _all the evil there ever was_ — and you will begin to recognize your own role in ending it. Humanity is badly lost, and it is only by finding our own way out of the abyss that we learn how to lead others out instead of secretly shoving them deeper in.

It is impossible to overstate the cleverness of this ruse. It is why we sometimes suspect the existence of an evil global conspiracy running the world from behind the scenes. The darkness in our minds is indeed conspiring, behaving more like a singular _distributed malevolent entity_, manipulating all of humanity from beneath our conscious thresholds. The Christians know it as the Devil, and the Buddhists call it the ego. You can treat it as a metaphor, but it is also as real as anything you can touch. It is the _primordial_ evil conspiracy; the one to which all the rest owe their existence, and to which they ultimately filter up. It keeps our attention fixated perpetually outward, on the evil "out there," so that we never notice its insidious presence "in here"; the one place where we can actually defeat it. Every attempt to subdue it externally without being free of it internally only ends up creating more, in ways that are normally invisible to our conscious minds — but that we _can_ learn to see.

It is surely true that "the elites" are playing us common people against each other to take our attention off of them, but the Devil is playing a _much_ bigger game; one in which even the elites are merely pawns. It _wants_ us to hate them, to take our attention off of _it_. But if hating them isn't the right approach, then what is? To understand this, we must first go deeper.

It all seeps into our physical reality, poisoning it. Everything from our unhealthy air, water, and soil, to our myriad societal ills and the climate crisis, is ultimately an external manifestation of a sickness within. As long as we perceive this sickness to exist only in others, we will never discover the hidden aspect of our own minds that secretly enables it, continually confusing our contempt for our authentic good. This is in no way suggesting that we are all equally complicit, by any stretch of the imagination. Nonetheless, we each have a profound role to play in leading the world back to the Light.

We've been led astray by a society that points us in precisely the wrong direction to accomplish this, although that is nobody's fault in particular. Our power does not lie in lording our superiority over others — including the "bad people" — but in discovering our surprising commonality with them. This is not some kumbaya sentiment, either. Again, genuine kindness has nothing to do with being nice. It can be fierce or even violent if necessary. It can take almost any form at all. Its only defining characteristic is that it is utterly free of self-deception. It does not misperceive evil as being intrinsic to any mind, and this seemingly-subtle change makes all the difference. The profound integrity of this act prevents the darkness in others from finding the "hook" in our own that it would normally use to justify itself, and is thereby weakened. Although we may still be enemies on the surface, our Light is becoming allied. We are beginning to remember how this whole game actually works.

To be clear: it does no good to pretend that you can see the Light in others when you can't. Doing so can backfire miserably. Thus, both pretending to see the Light and overlooking it are harmful. The only solution is to learn to actually see it, which happens naturally as you uncover your own. Similarly, it is astonishingly easy to lie to ourselves about whether our violent behavior is radical kindness or merely self-deception. This is how the darkness sneaks in. Perhaps the clearest measure of our own ability to deceive ourselves is how much contempt we are able to muster for our enemies; the "bad people." To the degree that this potential is present, we are susceptible to sliding down the dark path that has enabled every atrocity there ever was, without ever realizing that we've done so. All that is required is the right — or wrong — confluence of circumstances. This happens faster than you can imagine, and you _do not_ want to find yourself there. You _will_ have to confront it, sooner or later.

---

Everything you do makes a difference, in ways that you can hardly fathom. There are vast and subtle networks of causality that we are normally unconscious of, and that secretly drive the fate of the world. If we pay attention only to the surface activity, we miss out on the bulk of what actually shapes our reality. Evil can look sweet and pretty, while kindness may look nothing like our naive interpretations of it. It is impossible to know which is which — and easy to convince ourselves otherwise — until we have done the deep inner work that eradicates the core confusion. We each catch glimpses from time to time, and it is our duty to carry those glimpses into the world as best we are able. I wish I could tell you that I have completed the journey myself, but alas, I am a mere fledgling. I am still liable to mess things up royally, and I hope you will hold my feet to the fire when I do. I promise to do the same for you.

May all beings be free from suffering and its causes. Amen.

================================


Reflecting on the dysfunctional state of the world, it's hard not to suspect that there's some sort of evil conspiracy lurking behind it all. In a sense, there actually is, but it is *infinitely more strange* than we can fathom. The only way to end it is to recognize its existence within our very own minds. Only by freeing ourselves from its insidious grip do we gain the capacity to free others.

---

Have you ever done something that you believed was right at the time, only to realize much later that it was actually wrong — even according to your own deepest standards? It is a bizarre sort of experience. You are confronted with the fact that on some level, you knew it was wrong even as you did it — yet you managed to hide this knowledge from yourself, so that in another sense, you really *didn't* know. Every one of us engages in such "conscience skirting," whether we realize it or not. Indeed, it is those of us who are least aware of it who are most engaged in it.

What is it that allows us to hide knowledge of our wrongdoing from our own conscious minds? This state is a paradoxical one: we simultaneously *know* and yet somehow *do not.* It is this phenomenon that is responsible for *all the evil there ever was,* from the tiniest act of unkindness to the most horrific atrocity ever committed. Our examples may differ in degree, but not in kind — and every time any one of us engages in it, we lower the threshold for others to do the same.

We never notice when we ourselves are in it, but we're highly sensitive to its presence in others. It makes us perceive them as *bad people*, who we then feel compelled to treat accordingly. We believe that by treating the "bad people" with contempt — that is, as though they are *fundamentally defective* — we will somehow benefit the world. But if you look carefully enough into your mind while feeling this way — and this is hard — you'll discover something much more insidious at work.

Contempt is a fundamentally malicious attitude, and simply by harboring it, you are telegraphing to your target that you're in the grip of self-deception yourself. You may feel like you're "fighting evil," but deep down, you know that you're only liable to make them dig in their heels — which you can then use as evidence that you were right about them, thus compelling you to escalate. Something in us *wants* to be forced to unleash the full extent of our righteous wrath — perhaps the most delicious feeling of all.

Although you may not realize that you're doing this — at least, consciously — your enemy subconsciously does, which is *why* they dig in their heels. They are perceiving in you the very error that you are viciously judging them for, which makes them perceive *you* as "evil" for precisely the same reason you see *them* that way. Any compunction they might have felt about their own wrongdoing goes out the window — which is precisely the result you secretly wanted.

What happened is that the darkness in your own mind recognized itself in your enemy, who it then lured into this trap. It is like a *secret handshake* between your darkness and theirs. The world is darkened as a result, but we don't notice this — or if we do, we blame it on them. After all, any *decent* person would have repented, or at least introspected, in the face of such overwhelming good. We have created *new evil* in the world, but we tell ourselves that we're simply uncovering the evil already there. After all, they are *fundamentally* defective, and so nothing *we* did could have made any difference.

This is just one of an infinite number of ways the darkness tricks us into doing its bidding while flawlessly convinced that we are helping. The truth is that *any* time we skirt our conscience — which is *far more often* than we realize — we are secretly inviting others to do the same, who we can then blame for the sorry state of the world, thereby licensing ourselves to engage in *more* self-serving behavior that we will never recognize as such.

This is how the darkness keeps itself alive; cleverly hiding itself from our own minds while powerfully sensitizing us to its presence in others. We don't recognize that they are in the grip of a delusion that we ourselves are highly susceptible to; no, we see *their* evil as intrinsic, compelling us to viciously attack it. We never realize that this feeling of *moral superiority* is itself the surest sign that we are under its dark sway. A mind that is free of self-deception simply cannot feel malice, contempt, or even self-righteousness toward *anybody* for any reason.

This is the opposite of what society teaches us: that to be "good people," we must show our contempt for the "bad people." In a way, this isn't entirely wrong: contempt for *beliefs* and *behaviors* can indeed come from a good place. But it almost always degenerates into contempt for the people themselves. All goodwill drains from our hearts, and we embrace the darkness, convincing ourselves that in this case, it isn't really darkness at all. In fact, we can *prove* it.

This could all be avoided if we learned to listen to our hearts instead of focusing exclusively on our minds. Our thoughts can be freely manipulated by the darkness, which is why it is so easy to justify evil behavior. Our thoughts are the perfect vector for the darkness to sneak in, without us ever suspecting it. If you *really* want to know whether you're acting from your inner Light or from your darkness, you cannot blindly trust your mind. You must learn to see deeper.

The vast majority of dark behavior feels nothing at all like evil. It simply feels like "business as usual." We find all kinds of ways to justify subtly self-serving behavior, covering it up with clever cover stories about all the good it will do. These justifications have a certain "signature" to them that you can learn to perceive, both in yourself and in others. When you recognize it, stay far away. You can be *certain* that no good will come of it, no matter how cleverly anyone proves otherwise. Disregard this at your own peril — and at everyone else's, too.

The darkness dims our perception of the *life* in others — be they people, animals, or nature at large — so that we cannot feel the deep sense of wrongness that comes from dominating, exploiting, or mistreating them. It's not that we *can't* feel it; it's that the darkness *blinds* us to it. It is this phenomenon that enables genocides, our ravaging of the planet — and, perhaps most surprisingly, our hatred for the people who engage in these atrocities.

It is impossible to overstate just how insidious the darkness is. It behaves like a _singular distributed malevolent entity_, manipulating all of humanity from beneath our conscious thresholds. The Christians know it as the Devil, and the Buddhists call it the ego. You can treat it as a metaphor, but it is as real as anything you can touch. It is the _primordial_ evil conspiracy; the one to which all the rest owe their existence, and to which they ultimately filter up. 

We are learning to recognize that "the elites" are playing us against each other, to take our attention off of them — but the Darkness is playing a _much bigger game_; one in which even the elites are merely pawns. It _needs_ us to hate them, to keep the whole cycle alive. By keeping our attention fixated perpetually outward, on the evil "out there," we never notice its insidious presence "in here"; the one place where we can actually defeat it.

It is only once you've seen how thoroughly the Darkness has ensnared your own mind that you begin to appreciate what is taking place in the minds of the "bad people" — and exactly how to free them of it. Without seeing this, it is *only* possible to drive them deeper into its sinister clutches, while feeling flawlessly convinced that you are "helping." So how do we see it?

---

There can be moments in life — such as during psychedelic trips, near-death experiences, or deep meditation or prayer — when you are confronted with the full depths of your own self-deception. You are shown every single instance where you skirted your conscience; every act of lying to yourself for your own personal gain. You are brought face-to-face with all the harm you've ever perpetrated since time immemorial, and it is more than you could ever hope to clean up in a single lifetime. The pain is beyond what you can fathom; more than you can bear. How widely and quickly it spread! How many it affected! The darkness exploited your fear and pride, enabling you to do things you otherwise couldn't if only you had been seeing clearly.

But slowly, it dawns on you: the reason it hurts so much is that you never actually wanted to do any of this. It is only profound confusion that enabled it. Your whole being is then absorbed into that part of you that never wanted to hurt anyone; never _could_ want such a thing. Then, suddenly, the full mass of darkness is lifted from your mind. It feels exactly like being freed of a demonic possession. Beneath it is a Light so vast that it defies description; an infinite Love for all of reality that excludes nothing and forsakes no-one. You never truly departed from this Light; indeed, never could, because it turns out you _are_ the Light! But the big reveal is that, astonishingly, *so is everyone else*.

In fact, you ultimately _are_ everyone and everything else, just pretending that you're not. One consciousness, peering out through countless eyes. There are many ways to say this, all of which sound absurd to the rational mind. But when you fully unveil the Light in yourself, you automatically see it in everyone else — including those who convincingly seemed not to have any. This is what the darkness is trying to hide. Everything we do to each other — or to Nature herself — we ultimately do to ourselves. How crazy to think otherwise! How foolish to judge others for not seeing it, when we weren't able to see it yet ourselves! Such a silly game we play, with such tragic consequences. We are continually shoving each other into the abyss to prevent others from waking up, because we're not ready to wake up ourselves. Seeing this, we lose all desire to "get away" with any form of misbehavior. Why would we want to hide from the Light? How did we ever think we could? The sooner we see give this up, the better for everyone.

The strangest part is discovering how you simultaneously _knew_ this and yet somehow _didn't_. You convinced yourself that your unkind behavior was "for the greater good," even as you knew better. You could always perceive the inner Light in the "bad people," and you chose to smother it anyway — knowing that if you compartmentalized this knowledge carefully enough, nobody could blame you for it, because _you yourself_ would no longer know. Yet others could somehow sense what you were doing, and it gave them an excuse to pin the darkness on you. It is only now that you see how they were only lost in the same confusion that you were, that you are able to truly forgive them. You discover the surprising sense in which nobody actually _wants_ to harbor the darkness — or rather, how their apparent desire to harbor it is simply the Universe balancing out our own desperate need to externalize our own; almost like a conservation law. We should practically thank them for becoming the scapegoats that we needed.

You see for the first time _how_ others could sense what you were really doing, despite your astonishingly clever attempts to hide it. At the very deepest level, your mind is not truly separate from theirs, or from the world at large. It's not that others can read your mind, per se, but your deepest motivations inevitably weave themselves into the fabric of your "outer" reality; the two being fundamentally inseparable. The deepest choice of all is whether to stand firm in your Light or give in to the impostor. It is a choice you make in every moment, whether you know it or not — and the cumulative result determines your ultimate impact on the world. Others can sense your choices at a subconscious level, and these subtly influence their own. Our culture has convinced itself that this is mystical nonsense, despite it being right under our noses. We do this so that we can harbor our demons while pretending this has no consequences. The more we heal as a species, the more this worldview evaporates.

There is no way to force others to see any of this; force being a manifestation of the same fundamental mistake. Those who are most powerful at inducing this realization in others are simply those who hold it most strongly themselves. They are literally incapable of feeling malice, contempt, or self-righteousness, having thoroughly seen through them as horsemen of the darkness. Yet they are not weak. They are unafraid to fiercely confront the darkness in others. Being free of darkness themselves, they are immune to its sinister charms. This enables their accusations to penetrate other minds, instead of being deflected by the defense mechanisms that the rest of us unwittingly trigger. Their attack therefore finds its mark — which is the darkness itself, and not the confused being who unwittingly harbors it — even if the being needs to be harmed in the process. This is all very difficult to describe, but part of you knows exactly what I mean.

In the same way that your darkness can extend a secret handshake to theirs, your Light can do the same. It is nowhere near as violently pleasurable as attacking the darkness, but infinitely more valuable. This process can take a long time to unfold, and require many iterations — but it is the _only_ way that darkness is released from our world.

---

If we ultimately are the Light, how on Earth did we get to this place that looks nothing like it? This process is extremely tricky to convey, because it doesn't fit into our culture's standard metaphysics. You could say it all began with a subtle turn away from the Light. Then, fearing that we'd lost contact with our _absolute_ goodness, we went out seeking for it _relatively_ — that is, at the expense of apparent "others." We felt that we had to make them _bad_, and then violently defeat them, to earn our way back to our original goodness. But this just made things worse, and it quickly spiraled out of control. This is the apparent reality in which we now live.

The hardest thing to communicate about this story is that it does not unfold in what we normally conceive of as linear time. In a profound and surprising sense, every moment is the very first. Thus, every instant is an opportunity to rediscover our primordial Home, a place we never truly left. Each time we see this, we increasingly discover how our judgements of others are actually pointers back to an unhealed part of ourselves. As we heal ourselves, we discover how to heal our relationship with the "other," until it slowly dawns on us that there was never truly an "other." The more we see this, the more we vow to hold the Light for these seeming others, even when — indeed, _especially_ when — they cannot hold it for themselves. Far from being a burden, we discover that this has always been our true purpose; our deepest calling. Every encounter with evil becomes an opportunity to strengthen our commitment to the Light.

Looked at this way, kindness is anything that brings us all closer to remembering the truth, and evil is anything that pushes us away from it. Forsaking others is thus always a form of evil. It is a form of forsaking ourselves, because we are not ready to come Home yet. If this language feels too religious for you, feel free to find your own framing. In the end, there is only one truth anyway.

---

Unlike the Light, the darkness is not a real entity. It is a profound absence masquerading as a presence. It is ultimately only our willingness to turn away from our Light, instead listening to our agendas and justifications. As such, it can never be defeated by more absence. Yet make no mistake: although it is an absence, it still behaves like a sinister presence; a parasite of the mind. The darkness you see your enemies is the very _same_ entity that exists in your own mind, and that provokes you into seeing theirs as intrinsic. It manipulates your perception at such a fundamental level that you simply cannot fathom that you're being fooled. You're certain that you're seeing reality _as it is_. It is an _impossibly_ clever trick.

It is difficult to overstate just how much of our civilization is built on the shaky foundations of our aggregate self-deception. Every time any one of us skirts our conscience in any way, we contribute to the universal bank of darkness. Revenge fantasy films, YouTube videos of "Karens getting owned," vicious Facebook threads full of casual cruelty — each is a breeding ground for our collective demons.

> _Be kind, for everyone you meet is fighting a great battle._ —Author unknown

What is kindness? It is the only thing that actually fights evil. Everything else just makes it worse.

---

The deepest part of you can perceive yourself in literally everyone and everything, strange as that may sound; yet you hide this knowledge from your conscious mind, so that you don't have to feel their suffering. It is this same mechanism that enables the "bad people" to do what *they* do: their minds are shielding them from fully perceiving the *life* in their victims — be they other people, animals, or nature at large. This is the secret principle behind *all the evil there ever was.*

Any time any one of us employs this shielding, we lower the threshold for everyone else to do the same — no matter how noble our intent. For example, when we witness evil, we often feel compelled not only to *stop* the evildoer, but to *harm* them — quite independently of any good it will bring. This is difficult to admit. We tell ourselves that we're acting for "the greater good," but part of us simply enjoys seeing the "bad people" suffer.

Which of these is our true intention — the good or the harm? Does it even matter? So long as our cruelty produces *some* benefit — which it actually might — who cares if we also get to feel a bit of glee from watching them suffer? After all, it is a private pleasure that has no bearing on the outcome. But this is a dark lie.

<p align="center" width="100%">
    <img width="300px" src="img/half-evil.png"> 
</p>

Not only can our target sense the malicious intent, but we secretly *want* them to. We are baiting them into behavior that will force us to escalate, but in a way that will keep our hands apparently clean. Something in us wants to be forced to unleash the full extent of our righteous wrath —because **nothing** feels better than violently punishing evil.

Part of us knows this will only drive the darkness deeper into their minds, thereby darkening the world as a whole; and that any benefit that may accrue will be temporary and superficial at best — yet we conceal this knowledge, writing it off as unfortunate collateral damage. But it isn't "collateral" at all: it is secretly the *whole point.*

> _And no wonder, for even Satan masquerades as an angel of light. So it is not strange that his ministers also masquerade as ministers of righteousness._ —2 Corinthians 11:14-16

Evil is a kind of mind-virus. We recognize it easily in others but never in ourselves. It compels us to viciously attack them, never realizing that this only conveys that we're under the sway of the very delusion we're violently judging *them* for, thus compelling them to return the favor. It is like a secret handshake between our darkness and theirs — which it turns out aren't separate at all.

<p align="center" width="100%">

All of our Darkness behaves more like a _singular distributed malevolent entity_, manipulating all of humanity from beneath our conscious thresholds. The Christians know it as the Devil, and the Buddhists call it the ego. You can treat it as a metaphor, but it is as real as anything you can touch. It is why we sometimes suspect the existence of an evil global conspiracy. It is the _primordial_ evil conspiracy; the one to which all the rest owe their existence and to which they ultimately filter up.

This entity drives us relentlessly toward Armageddon — situations where everyone is violently proving how _righteous_ they are. It is why the US may be headed toward civil war, and explains bitter [divorces](https://www.gottman.com/blog/this-one-thing-is-the-biggest-predictor-of-divorce/)  where each side feels like the exclusive victim / hero. Nearly the whole world is caught in its terrible sway, evil provoking evil at every turn, without anyone recognizing its true origin deep within our psyches.

Every act of unkindness we've ever perpetrated on anyone; all the hardness we carry in our hearts; has only ever been in service of humanity's ultimate nemesis.

To be clear: there really *are* people who knowingly serve the Darkness, and who conspire to cause great harm. They must be stopped, and this isn't always "nice." But to the extent that we perceive them as *fundamentally* defective, or ourselves as *intrinsically superior* — in short, with contempt — we are falling into the ultimate trap. Contempt for *beliefs* or *behaviors* isn't necessarily harmful, but contempt for people always is. It exists only to help us hide our own darkness from ourselves by reinforcing it in others — allies, enemies, and bystanders alike.

The vast majority of dark behavior feels **absolutely nothing like evil**. It simply feels like "business as usual." We find all kinds of ways to justify self-serving behavior, using the sorry state of the world as an excuse. Corporations cheat us, so who cares if we skim from them? Our political opponents are morally defective, so why shouldn't we mock and shame them? There are infinitely more examples, most of which are too subtle to capture in words.

It is not that skimming or shaming are inherently wrong. But we disregard that quiet voice warning us that we are lying to ourselves. The more we lie, the more we lose the ability to detect that it *is* a lie. The "little voice" gets increasingly drowned out by clever justifications, which we fail to recognize as such — because why would our own minds lie to us? This is the trap in which modern humans are caught. We have abandoned our inner knowing for clever judgments. After all, if something cannot be objectively proven, then it might as well not exist.

<p align="center" width="100%">
    <img width="300px" src="img/angel-devil-shoulders.png"> 
</p>

Every time any one of us makes this mistake — which happens *far more often* than we realize — we are strengthening the same capacity in everyone else. The dark lies that politicians use to foment wars are made of the very same "stuff" as the lies we tell ourselves. Again, it's not just the same *kind* of stuff. Each act of self-deception gets woven into the very fabric of our reality, accumulating in the body politic, reconfiguring itself, eventually erupting in the form of atrocities that we feel *absolutely no connection* to — and which then serve as justification for *more*.

Without recognizing our own role in all this, it is impossible to do actual good in the world. Instead, we will continually buy into whichever narratives sound best — never recognizing that no matter how "good" they are, we are secretly just feeding the Beast. If we really want to know whether a cause is "good" or not, we cannot simply evaluate its *contents*. We must be able to feel into its *origin.* **So much suffering** could be avoided if we only learned to recognize this.

The entire fight against evil comes down to recognizing this "deeper knowing." For it is only by seeing how cleverly the darkness has manipulated our own minds that we begin to recognize just how deeply the "bad people" are stuck — and exactly what we can do about it.

Yet they somehow always knew.

You now see _how_ they knew despite your astonishingly clever attempts to hide it. At the very deepest level, your mind is not separate from theirs. It's not that others can read your mind, per se, but your inner motivations inevitably leak into your outer reality; the two being fundamentally inseparable. Everything you do "in here" has an impact "out there," whether you see it or not.

The deepest motivation of all is to be of service to the Whole and not just to a part. This is a choice you make in every moment, whether you know it or not. Others can sense this choice at a subconscious level, and it influences their own. Your unwillingness to forsake them under any circumstances slowly reminds their darkness of the *one thing* it can never truly hide from. This is the *only* way that evil evaporates from our world. If you been freed from your own, it is only due to the grace of countless "others," whom you now honor by paying it forward.

There is no way to force others to see any of this; force being a manifestation of the same fundamental mistake. Those who are most powerful at inducing this realization in others are simply those who hold it most strongly themselves. They are literally incapable of feeling malice, contempt, or self-righteousness toward *anybody* for *any reason*, having thoroughly recognized them as weapons of the Darkness. Yet such people are not weak. They are unafraid to fiercely confront the darkness in others. 

This is true kindness, and it has nothing to do with being nice. It need not take any form in particular. Its only defining characteristic is that it is utterly free of self-deception. It surgically targets the parasite itself, instead of the confused being who unwittingly harbors it. The profound integrity of this act prevents their parasite from finding the excuse it would otherwise use to reinforce itself, and is weakened as a result. The more entrenched a person's darkness, the more fierce the kindness required to uproot it. It may be tough love, but it is always Love.

In the same way that your darkness can extend a secret handshake to others, your Light can do the same. It is nowhere near as violently pleasurable as subjugating them, but infinitely more valuable.

If we ultimately are the Light, how on Earth did we get to this place that looks nothing like it? This process is extremely tricky to convey, because it doesn't fit into our culture's standard metaphysics. We began as undifferentiated Light, but then made the mistake of subtly turning away from it. Then, fearing that we'd lost contact with our _absolute_ goodness, we went out seeking for it _relatively_ — that is, at the expense of "others." This simultaneously *created* those "others," who we then felt compelled to violently defeat, in order to prove our own goodness and thereby return Home. But this just made things worse, and the whole thing quickly spiraled out of control. This is the apparent reality in which we now live.

The hardest thing to communicate about this story is that it does not unfold in what we normally conceive of as linear time. In a profound and surprising sense, every moment is the very first. Thus, every instant is an opportunity to rediscover our primordial Home, a place we never truly left. Each time we see this, we increasingly discover how our judgements of others are actually pointers back to an unhealed part of ourselves. As we heal ourselves, we discover how to heal our relationship with the "other," until it slowly dawns on us that there was never truly an "other."

The more we see this, the more we vow to hold the Light for these seeming others, even when — indeed, _especially_ when — they cannot hold it for themselves. Far from being a burden, we discover that this has always been our true purpose; our deepest calling. Every encounter with evil becomes an opportunity to strengthen our commitment to the Light.

Looked at this way, kindness is anything that brings us all closer to remembering the truth, and evil is anything that pushes us away from it. Forsaking others is thus always a form of evil. It is a form of forsaking ourselves, because we are not ready to come Home yet. If this language feels too religious for you, feel free to find your own framing. In the end, there is only one Truth.

> *Darkness cannot drive out darkness, only light can do that. Hate cannot drive out hate, only love can do that.* ― Martin Luther King, Jr.

Unlike the Light, the darkness is not a real entity. It is a profound absence masquerading as a presence. This is why it cannot be defeated by more absence. Yet make no mistake: it still behaves like a sinister presence. It manipulates our perception at such a fundamental level that we simply cannot fathom that we're being fooled. We're certain that we're seeing reality _as it is_. It is an _impossibly_ clever trick, but one we can learn to see through.

Revenge fantasy films, YouTube videos of "Karens getting owned," Facebook threads full of casual cruelty and jokes about "Darwin awards" — each is a breeding ground for our collective Demon. It all seeps into our physical reality, slowly poisoning it. Everything from our unhealthy air, water, and soil, to our myriad societal ills and the climate crisis itself, is ultimately an external manifestation of a sickness within. As long as we perceive it to exist only in others, we will never discover its hidden aspect in ourselves. This is in no way suggesting that we are all equally complicit. Yet we each have a unique role to play in leading us all back to the Light.

To be clear: it does no good to pretend that we can see the Light in others when we can't. Doing so can backfire miserably. Thus, both pretending to see the Light in others and overlooking it can be harmful. The only solution is to learn to *actually* see it, which happens as a natural consequence of unveiling our own. Similarly, it is astonishingly easy to lie to ourselves about whether our violent behavior is "radical kindness" or merely self-deception. This is a common way for the darkness to sneak in.

Perhaps the clearest measure of our ability to deceive ourselves is how much contempt we still feel for our enemies. To the degree that this potential is still present, we are susceptible to sliding down the dark path that has enabled every genocide, without ever realizing that we are. All that is required is the right — or wrong — confluence of circumstances. To believe yourself immune is the greatest of follies, and the surest indication that you are *not.*

There are vast and subtle networks of causality that we normally hide from ourselves, and that secretly drive the fate of the world. Everything we do makes a difference, in ways that we can hardly fathom. If we pay attention only to the surface activity, we miss out on the bulk of what actually shapes our reality. Evil can look sweet and pretty, while kindness sometimes looks nothing of the sort. It is impossible to know which is which — and easy to convince ourselves otherwise — until we have done the deep inner work that eradicates the core confusion. 

We each catch glimpses of the Light from time to time, and it is our duty to carry them into the world as best we are able. I wish I could tell you that I have completed the journey myself, but alas, I am a mere fledgling. I am still liable to mess things up royally, and I only ask that you hold my feet to the fire when I do. I promise to do the same for you.

May all beings be free from suffering and its causes. Amen.
