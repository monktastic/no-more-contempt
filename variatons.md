MLK famously said that darkness cannot drive out darkness—yet many of us still seem to think that it can; that if we are just cruel enough to the "bad people," then good will win. But this just demonstrates how powerful the darkness really is.

You see, part of you *knows* that your cruelty will only make the world a darker place—yet you find it nearly impossible to admit to yourself. This should give you a taste of what is happening in the mind of your enemy; the "bad person." They, too, are only able to do wrong because they are hiding the truth from themselves. That's what the darkness *is*: our ability to hide the truth from ourselves.

Part of you knows this, too—that you are not intrinsically superior to them—and it is just as hard to admit. The reason they have to lie to themselves is that just like you, the deepest part of them doesn't want to be doing it. That means there is Light in them—and thus what you are really doing is trying to *smother* that Light so that you can prove they have none. Of *course* you must never admit this to yourself. It's not just malicious; it is *malevolent.*

And that reveals *why* your behavior darkens the world: because you're harboring malevolence. That alone is enough to darken it. It always leaks out somehow.

As long as we are capable of feeling malice or contempt for *anyone*, we are still harboring the darkness, and it *will* find its way into the world—usually exactly during those times when we're most certain that we're doing good. This is why there is no shortcut to saving the world without doing the inner work yourself. Without that, you will always sabotage yourself—and the rest of us.
