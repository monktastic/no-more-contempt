Why do wise people urge compassion for evildoers? Are they being naïve? Or could it be that they see something that we don't?

Every one of us has had the experience of skirting our conscience — behaving in a way that goes against our deepest values, but that we convince ourselves is okay anyway.

Maybe we've helped ourselves to "a little extra" at the expense of a company, convinced that we're only harming its wealthy (and greedy) owners. Maybe it turns out that the owners weren't so wealthy after all, or that our cumulative behavior harmed many other people indirectly. But our minds found an excuse for those too — or else entirely blocked that knowledge from conscious awareness.

Or perhaps we were a little bit nasty to someone, convinced that they deserved it — having no deep insight into the true source of their misbehavior, and being unable to admit that we just compounded their difficulties in life. We can't see that a tiny part of them was actually trying to be better, and that our casual nastiness was the final straw that made them lose faith in humanity. To hide this, we convince ourselves that _no_ part of them was trying; that they are _fundamentally morally defective,_ and thus beyond help. But it doesn't feel like we're _convincing_ ourselves; it simply feels like "the truth."

As hard as it is to admit that we do this, much harder still is confronting the full impact of our behavior. All the darkness in the world is intimately connected. Every act of unkindness we commit eventually propagates into the Whole, lowering the threshold for darkness to manifest elsewhere. Each act of self-deception makes it more likely that genuine atrocities will be committed by someone, somewhere — atrocities for which we will not only feel absolutely no complicity, but which will actually trigger _self-righteous outrage_, thus inducing us to compound the problem. And part of us knows all of this.

This is the secret mechanism by which evil spreads without anyone having to take responsibility. Each one of us is only able to see the self-deception in others, provoking us to violently combat it, thus reinforcing it while flawlessly convinced that we are "helping." When you look into the eyes of a person and see "evil," what you are actually seeing is a locus where all this dark activity has accumulated especially intensely — and a seductive invitation to pile on _more_ in a way that is somehow still socially acceptable.

You would think that the "bad people" are (or _should_ be) especially aware of their evil, but the only reason they can do it in the first place is because their self-deception is especially good at hiding it from conscious self-awareness — and our attempts to violently evict it are secretly attempts to _reinforce_ it in a way that neither we nor anyone else will ever suspect. This is why our political opponents just dig in their heels when we mock and shame them: part of us _needs_ this outcome, so that we and they can continue to act as covers for each other's darkness.

Our darkness can indeed suppress other people's misbehavior — at least, in public, and for a time. We can thus easily convince ourselves that it "worked" — but only because we choose not to look too closely at the deeper effects of our behavior. They are always there to see, if only we choose to look.

> _And no wonder, for even Satan masquerades as an angel of light. So it is not strange that his ministers also masquerade as ministers of righteousness._ —2 Corinthians 11:14-16

From a certain perspective, our cumulative shadowy activity appears sentient; even intelligent. In fact, your darkness and mine aren't truly separate: they behave more like appendages of a _distributed malevolent entity_, manipulating all of humanity from within the dark crevices of our own minds; the places where we dare not look. It is what some cultures know as the _Devil_ — and it is as "real" as anything you can touch. It keeps our attention perpetually fixated outward, on the evil "out there," so that we will never bother to look too closely "in here" — the one place where we have direct power over it.

<p align="center" width="100%"><img width="300px" src="./img/shared-devil.png"></p>

In more modern terms, it is the _evil global conspiracy_ — that secret cabal responsible for all the world's ills, yet whose full membership remains forever elusive. It is the _primordial_ evil conspiracy, to which all the rest owe their existence, and to which they ultimately filter up. All the conspiracies you can consciously identify "out there" ultimately originate from this shared hidden aspect of mind. They feel "shadowy" because they are outer reflections of our collective unconscious. To believe that you have pinned it down externally is to have fallen into its most basic trap.

It is said that the elites are playing us off one another to take attention away from themselves — but the Devil is playing a _much_ bigger game; one in which even the elites are merely pawns. It controls our perception and models of reality so completely that to even suspect its existence marks one as "insane." We feel that the dark state of our world must be due to individuals who are fundamentally unlike us, and whose violent elimination would therefore bring peace. It is astonishing that we never notice where these dark thoughts actually originate from, and what master they secretly serve.

The one weapon we have against the darkness is our Light. You could also call it kindness, or compassion.

**Compassion has nothing to do with being nice.** It is simply about being free of self-deception, so that our attempts to fight evil do not have the "unintended" consequence of creating more. From here, contempt (for people) is impossible, because you clearly see the sense in which the Darkness is impersonal, despite people obviously having _chosen_ it in some sense. Its greatest trick is to make you hate them for having done so, not realizing that this hatred is _you_ choosing the darkness yourself — and that others can subconsciously tell that you're making this choice, which licenses them to do it more, which part of you knows but cannot admit, which is what makes the choice evil in the first place.

That's a lot to unpack, so let's try again.

Contempt for "bad people" is secretly an attempt to create _more_ darkness in a way that appears righteous, to provide cover for our own self-deception. The same is true of malice and self-righteousness. It is _extremely hard_ to admit this, but other people can always tell, if only subconsciously. It thereby acts as a "secret handshake" that licenses them to do it _more_, even as we pretend to be fighting it. 

In other words, our unwillingness to confront our own darkness is what perpetuates it in the world. Indeed, it is this very unwillingness that makes it "dark" in the first place. **Evil is ultimately nothing but _the willingness to look away_ — not just from the darkness "out there," but the darkness "in here."**

But what is it that we're looking away _from_, exactly? To say that "evil is the willingness to look away from evil" would be circular.

There is a profound and astonishing sense in which we **are** everyone and everything. Realizing this in its entirety is known as _enlightenment_ (en-_Light_-enment), and is indeed a lofty goal — but all of us can sense it at all times, to some degree. **You are the Light.** It is why we thank other people even for acts of kindness that don't benefit us directly. We intuit that what happens to any part ultimately happens to the whole. Evil is nothing but our inability (or unwillingness) to see this.

This is why contempt is intrinsically self-deceptive: it is the pretense that we are _fundamentally better_ than others, which the deepest part of us realizes is a sham — and which they can sense too, no matter how "evil" they are. It is this common knowledge (in the [technical sense](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/common-knowledge/): that _they know that we know that they know..._) that permits evil to spread in the way described above — and ironically, it is rooted in our fundamental unity.

<p align="center" width="100%"><img width="300px" src="./img/good-vs-bad.png"></p>

Looking down on others is looking down on ourselves; harming them ultimately harms us; and forsaking them is secretly a desire to forsake ourselves, because we're not ready to come Home yet. Until we see this, literally everything we do to "fight evil" secretly perpetuates it. It is only through compassion — freedom from self-deception — that we discover how to fight evil in a way that actually works.

**Such behavior need not look anything like "compassion" in the conventional sense.** It may be fierce or violent, perhaps even manifesting as mocking and shaming. It may require _apparent_ contempt. But it arises from a very different source, and has a very different impact on all minds involved. Its deep integrity prevents the darkness in others from finding easy justification for itself. **This is the secret mechanism by which the _Light_ spreads.**

At its fiercest, the Light can look almost indistinguishable from darkness — _almost._ They can be hard to tell apart, but our subconscious always knows. It is this apparent difficulty that allows our darkness to sneak in. But the most humbling discovery is that it was never truly "subconscious": it was always perfectly accessible to consciousness, if only we had looked. Again, _we chose not to look._ We chose our agendas and ideologies instead, confusing them for our Love.

This is the most painful realization, but also the most liberating: all that is required to redeem ourselves is to _choose to look_. Doing this even once, we see that we never truly _wanted_ to look away; that we never _could_ want such a thing — and that nobody else could either, if only they knew. Our commitment to Look creates ripples throughout reality, impacting it in ways that we may never fully appreciate. This is the greatest gift we have to offer the world.

I wish I could leave you with some wisdom about real, practical ways to put this knowledge to use. Alas, such wisdom is the work of a lifetime, and I am a mere fledgling myself. All I know is that I wish to stop playing the dark game that we have inherited, and to exchange it for a more beautiful one. I only hope that you will join me — and that you will hold my feet to the fire with unflinching kindness when I (pretend to) forget.

> *Nail on the head brother. My most recent mushroom trip (also the largest dose I've ever taken) I became fixated on a news story I had heard that week. About an 8 year old girl from a tribe in the Amazon, who was tied to a tree and burned alive in order to scare her people off their land so it could be logged. I realized that at the moment he did it, whoever lit that gasoline actually felt / thought more or less okay about what he was doing. **And my mind was illuminated with dozens of the parallels between that man's malformed, horrific perceptual / behavioral state, and mine. I saw the same mistakes in value attribution, the same willful ignorance of the consequences of my acts and words. And there was nothing I could do to deny the similarity.***
