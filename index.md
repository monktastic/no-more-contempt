_Warning: This piece is about the nature of good and evil. It is **not** light reading._

When wise people urge compassion for evildoers, they're not suggesting that we be _nice_. They're warning us about an insidious trap that we keep falling into, and that is destroying our civilization.

Consider [this horrifying story from 2012](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/southamerica/brazil/9005835/Loggers-burned-Amazon-tribe-girl-alive.html):

> _Loggers in Brazil captured an eight-year-old girl from one of the Amazon's last uncontacted tribes and burned her alive as part of a campaign to force the indigenous population from its land [...]_

Can you feel the profound anger and heartbreak for the girl, her tribe, and humanity? It makes you want to do everything in your power to ensure this kind of thing never happens again — including punishing and maybe even harming the perpetrators if need be. At the same time, you may feel a desire to harm them quite _independently_ of any good it will bring: pure old-fashioned vengeance.

These two motivations — compassion and malice — arise from very different aspects of mind, but can be _extremely_ difficult to tell apart. We usually dress up the latter to make it seem respectable; like it is "for the greater good." We tell ourselves that it doesn't matter which intention is driving our behavior; that only the _result_ matters. Similarly, we feel more than okay being casually cruel to anyone we perceive as vaguely "bad," because we are good — and therefore such behavior _must_ be good. We even calculate _how_ it will be good (for example, by shutting them up).

This profound confusion is how evil sneaks into the world undetected.

_Before I speak to your mind, let me speak to your heart. Imagine how dark and twisted a mind has to become to feel okay about doing what those loggers did. If you inspect your heart carefully enough, you will find that pushing such a mind deeper into the abyss is every bit as malevolent as burning a girl alive. But we carefully hide this truth from ourselves, to avoid confronting something that we'd be much better off dealing with immediately. This isn't a judgement of you. It's an attempt at communicating a horrifying punchline that part of us already knows is coming sooner or later._

We can't calculate all the downstream effects of even our tiniest behavior, but we _can_ know when we are being evil — and we owe it to ourselves and the world to stop.

As much as we try to hide our underlying motivations — even from ourselves — other people are _exquisitely_ sensitive to them, if only subconsciously. Malice makes us look evil — _because it is_, as we shall see — and it powerfully evokes _their_ malice in response.

Whatever storyline was justifying our target's behavior in the first place, it is now reinforced — because they can plausibly claim to be _fighting evil_. Our allies become more bloodlusted, too. Even if our target changes their behavior (in public, anyway), the darkness has been embedded deeper into their mind, and this _will_ manifest in some way and ripple out into the world — and we will be able to disown all complicity.

The world becomes darker as a result. But this isn't an unfortunate side effect of our well-intentioned behavior: it was secretly orchestrated by a sinister aspect within our minds. The way this works is _insanely_ clever.

<p align="center" width="100%">

</p>

People are only able to misbehave due to a kind of self-deception: part of them knows perfectly well that what they're doing is wrong, but that "wrongness" is cleverly hidden from conscious self-reflection. Part of us knows this, and that our malice will only exacerbate the problem, but we hide this knowledge from ourselves — because our identity as "good people" depends on them not "seeing the light," and who could blame us for not helping them see it? _This is self-deception_ — which makes them perceive us as evil for precisely the same reason that we did them, triggering a downward spiral into Hell.

It's not the _harm itself_ that caused this spiral, but the malice with which we did it. Harming them out of fierce compassion may still provoke some form of retaliation, but the profoundly benevolent intent prevents their self-deception mechanism from finding the "hook" it needs to reinforce itself.

<p align="center" width="100%">
    <img width="300px" src="img/devil-vs-devil.png"> 
</p>

If it is really this simple, then why aren't we already doing it?

Part of us _knows_ that we're not intrinsically better than anyone — but given how low people can sink, this is painful to admit, so we hide it. We use malice to keep people trapped in delusion, so that we can stay safely morally superior. Unfortunately, pushing people into the dark is hardly "morally superior," so we must hide this, too, in an ever-tightening noose of deception that collapses in on itself like a black hole, preventing us from ever suspecting what we're really doing.

Of course, we can't push just _anyone_ into the dark. We need plausible deniability...

> _And no wonder, for even Satan masquerades as an angel of light._ —2 Corinthians 11:14

You know the classic image of the angel and devil sitting on our shoulders? It's _almost_ accurate, except for two things. First, the angel isn't really external to you, but represents your true nature as compassion. In a deep sense, it *is* you (as we will discover later). The devil is external; a kind of parasite[^intrinsic]. But it doesn't just whisper obviously-bad ideas in your ear; it alters your very perception and pretends to be your inner angel.

<p align="center" width="100%">

> _Be kind, for everyone you meet is fighting a great battle._ —Author unknown

Your angel knows that this is how things work, and that even the most "evil" person is really under the sway of a parasite; one held in place by some "battle" invisible not only to you, but probably also them. As hard as it may be to evict, it's never _impossible._ Your devil makes it _appear_ impossible; as though their evil is intrinsic. They are _fundamentally defective_. This way, you don't need to worry about whether your behavior "drives it deeper," for there is no such thing.

But it gets crazier: your devil also knows that your perceiving them this way will cause them to perceive you in the same way — because your devil and theirs are identical. In fact, they're not just identical, but behave more like outgrowths of a single _shared_ Devil that is continually manipulating _all_ of our minds.

<p align="center" width="100%">
    <img width="300px" src="img/shared-devil.png"> 
</p>

This is not just a religious invention: anyone who introspects carefully enough eventually perceives this "distributed malevolent entity" with a kind of intelligence and volition of its own that, even if not _literally_ true, explain its seemingly-coordinated behavior terrifyingly well. 

It continually drives us toward various kinds of Armageddon: situations in which everyone is violently proving how righteous they are, once and for all. It is why the US is headed toward civil war without anyone recognizing their own complicity, and why there are bitter [divorces](https://www.gottman.com/blog/this-one-thing-is-the-biggest-predictor-of-divorce/) in which each side feels like the exclusive victim / hero. Nearly the whole world is caught in its terrible sway, evil provoking "righteous" evil at nearly every turn; everyone pointing fingers at everyone else, studiously overlooking its true source.

It is that primordial "evil global conspiracy" to which all the rest ultimately owe their existence — and _we_ are its unwitting minions. Every attempt to maliciously subdue it "out there" just strengthens it, because such behavior is only ever initiated _by_ it, while making us believe that it was initiated by us. 

**Any** time you feel malice, hatred, contempt, or even self-righteousness toward another being; any time you see them as fundamentally defective or inferior; any time you are tempted to divide the world into the (fundamentally) "good" and "bad," or to forsake anyone, you are being manipulated into feeding the Beast.

<p align="center" width="100%">
    <img width="300px" src="img/good-vs-bad.png"> 
</p>

To be clear: there are surely groups of particularly deluded people who conspire to cause great harm, but their existence wouldn't be possible if the rest of us weren't feeding the source — and conversely, it is _inevitable_ given that we are. **We must hold such people accountable**, but when we do this with contempt, we are reinforcing the conditions that effectively _compel_ their existence. If you look carefully enough, you will find your finger in their pies.

Our true enemy is not other people, but the dark "entity" that has captured _all_ of our minds. By keeping our attention fixated perpetually outward, it ensures that we never introspect deeply enough to discover how it works, and how to end it. From another perspective, it is what the Buddhists call the ego: the collection of habits we have developed that cause us to misperceive ourselves as separate and special.

> *The shadow is a moral problem that challenges the whole ego-personality, for no one can become conscious of the shadow without considerable moral effort. To become conscious of it involves recognizing the dark aspects of the personality as present and real. This act is the essential condition for any kind of self-knowledge.* —Carl Jung

The only way out of this trap is to see beyond the ego, to your fundamentally compassionate nature. When you see this, you cannot help but see it in everyone else, too — because in an astonishing sense, [they _are_ you](unity.md). This perception is not fully unveiled until enlightenment, but we can all taste it. Ultimately, all self-deception boils down to willful ignorance of this fact — and all unkindness reinforces it. Why "willful"? The remarkable punchline is that _part of you has known this all along._ Think of this piece as a reminder.

From that clarity of perception, you cannot possibly harbor malice or contempt. That enables you to perceive the hidden causes of their self-deception, allowing you to do something real about it. That's what compassion (aka kindness) is.

To be clear: this doesn't mean being _nice_. It can outwardly be as fierce (or violent[^dalai-lama-gun], or even _apparently_ contemptuous) as the situation warrants, but these behaviors come from a completely different source. People can sense your motivation even when you think they can't — in fact, even when _you_ (consciously) can't — and it makes all the difference in the world.

_This_ is why wise people urge compassion for evildoers: the _only_ alternative is to join them in evil.

Compassion doesn't always know what the most beneficial behavior _is_. It merely ensures that you are behaving in a way that is aligned with your deepest values; your profound love for the world. Determining the most effective behavior requires _wisdom_, which is a vast topic, and beyond the scope of this work. There is no doubt that dealing with profound evil in the real world is _hard_, and I am sorry not to be able to provide much guidance here.

> *Such a man knows that whatever is wrong in the world is also in himself, and if he only learns to deal with his own shadow, he has done something real for the world. He has succeeded in shouldering at least an infinitesimal part of the gigantic, unsolved problems of our day.* —Carl Jung

Enlightenment may be a lofty goal, but we can start small, by changing social norms. We can teach our children the difference between "kind" and "nice," and explain why kindness is _always_ the right motivation in all circumstances — even if it must express itself in a fierce (and occasionally violent) way. We can refuse to join our allies when they're caught up in the trap of contempt[^contempt], and remind them of a better way.

We _all_ have a role to play in defeating our true enemy — and it all begins with us.

> *Nail on the head brother. My most recent mushroom trip (also the largest dose I've ever taken) I became fixated on a news story I had heard that week. About an 8 year old girl from a tribe in the Amazon, who was tied to a tree and burned alive in order to scare her people off their land so it could be logged. I realized that at the moment he did it, whoever lit that gasoline actually felt / thought more or less okay about what he was doing. **And my mind was illuminated with dozens of the parallels between that man's malformed, horrific perceptual / behavioral state, and mine. I saw the same mistakes in value attribution, the same willful ignorance of the consequences of my acts and words. And there was nothing I could do to deny the similarity.***

## Footnotes

[^contempt]: Specifically, we mean (genuine) contempt for *people*. Contempt for ideas or behaviors can actually be healthy, as perhaps can (apparent) contempt that is rooted in genuine compassion.

[^intrinsic]: You may wonder how it is possible to know that evil is not intrinsic to other people's minds, but for our purposes it's more important to see that (1) our _perception_ of their intrinsic defectiveness is our own projection, and (2) our own darkness gives us the capacity to devolve into a condition in which others would be utterly convinced that _ours_ is intrinsic.

[^dalai-lama-gun]: The Dalai Lama was once asked what you should do if a gunman is trying to shoot you and you have a gun. [He said "shoot back."](https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/dalai-gun/)
