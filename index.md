Kindness is the hardest word to define, but also the most important. It doesn't mean being nice. Nice means pleasant and agreeable, which are fine qualities in most normal situations but useless in others. Kindness, on the other hand, means something much more profound. It is the right orientation in literally _every_ circumstance. But how could kindness be the right response to evil?

Fighting evil certainly requires being fierce — but there's a fine line between fierce and cruel. Fierceness can actually accomplish its goal, but cruelty is something else entirely. Its hidden purpose is to create _more_ evil in the world while giving us plausible deniability. It feels like we're viciously attacking the darkness in our enemy's mind; righteously punishing it, but something in us knows that our behavior is liable to make them commit _more_ evil, using our cruelty as justification — which will force us to punish them harder, etc., in a never-ending cycle. What's secretly happening is that the darkness in our own mind is using theirs as an excuse to unleash itself under noble pretenses, and theirs is responding in kind. It is like a secret handshake between our darkness and theirs; one that you can learn to sense.

It is impossible to overstate just how insidious and pervasive this dynamic is. We all believe we'd recognize if we were perpetrating it ourselves, but the whole reason it works so well is that it's incredibly well hidden from our conscious minds. The vast majority of such behavior looks nothing like overt cruelty. We mock, shame, and contemptuously judge our enemies, convinced that this is harmless or even helpful behavior. It's a far cry from _cruelty_, at any rate — especially because they earned it — but exactly the same dynamic is at work. Simply by perceiving ourselves as _intrinsically superior_ to others, we are telegraphing a fundamentally malicious attitude whose secret purpose is to provoke their dark side, so that we can justify even more self-righteous indignation.

We never realize that we're doing this, because if we did, the whole ruse would fall apart. The whole point is to justify our perception of ourselves as the _good guys_ and them as the _bad guys_ — and what kind of "good guy" would knowingly drive evil deeper into the minds of their enemies for their own benefit? So we hide this knowledge so carefully that even _we_ don't know that we're doing it. In this darkened state, we increasingly overlook the harmful and self-serving aspects of our own actions and agendas — and _this_ is evil's secret endgame. It's creating a world in which each of us is so convinced that the darkness exists only _out there_, that we never notice its insidious operation _in here._ Instead, we use it to justify our own selfish behavior — which we never recognize as such, convinced that we're only fighting evil.

The devil on our shoulders doesn't just whisper obviously-bad ideas in our ears; no, it alters our very perception so that we have no idea that we're obeying it. Or rather, part of us knows, but that knowledge is carefully hidden from our conscious minds, so that we convincingly pretend _not_ to know. We all know that our enemies do this, but by its very nature, we don't recognize it in ourselves — or, when we do, we easily forgive it. We walk around feeling like good people on a noble mission to valiantly defeat the evil "out there," never noticing that this very attitude is an irrefutable sign that we ourselves are infected. But others _do_ notice this — if only subconsciously — and it invites them to hate us for it, which only increases our conviction that we're the good guys, and must fight even harder. 

This is the secret mechanism behind _all the evil there ever was._ "Bad people" know perfectly well that they're doing wrong, but this knowledge is carefully shielded from conscious self-reflection, so that it doesn't _feel_ wrong. All they hear are their own clever justifications. A deep part of us recognizes that they're caught in the same trap that we're ensnared in, but another part senses that this a golden opportunity. By perceiving them as _fundamentally defective_, we license ourselves to treat them in ways that _deepen_ their self-deception while convinced that we're doing no such thing — after all, they're already as deep as they could go.

Thus, the vast majority of evil looks nothing like it does in the movies. It mostly consists of people justifying selfish behaviors wrapped up in magnificent garb that makes them appear noble, even to themselves. Yet every act of evil, from the tiniest unkindness to the most bone-chilling atrocity, ultimately depends on the very same principle — and every time any one of us engages in it, we secretly reinforce that capacity in everyone else. Every time we skirt our conscience, we license others to do the same, which we can then judge them for. Over time, this self-deception accumulates into the form of the  great evils of our world. It does not matter who feel contempt _for_; simply feeling it empowers humanity's ultimate foe. There is but _one_ darkness, and it manifests itself through countless guises.

This is why we sometimes suspect the existence of an evil global conspiracy running the world from behind the scenes. The darkness in our minds is indeed conspiring, behaving like a singular _distributed malevolent entity_, manipulating all of humanity from beneath our conscious thresholds. The Christians know it as the Devil, and the Buddhists call it the ego. You can treat it as a metaphor, but it is also as real as anything you can touch. It is the _primordial_ evil conspiracy; the one to which all the rest owe their existence, and to which they ultimately filter up. It keeps our attention fixated perpetually outward, on the evil "out there," so that we will never look "in here," at the one place where we can actually defeat it. Every attempt to subdue it externally without being free of it internally only ends up creating more, usually in invisible ways.

How do we know if it is operating in us? The most sure sign is the presence of malice, contempt, or self-righteousness. If we harbor even the faintest sense that we are _intrinsically_ superior to our enemies; that they are _fundamentally_ defective, then we are unknowingly caught in its sway. We could say that kindness is any behavior that is free from this self-deception. It is only from this place that darkness can actually be fought. But entering this place is not all rainbows and sunshine.

There can be moments in life — such as during psychedelic trips, near-death experiences, or deep meditation or prayer — when you are confronted with the full depths of your own self-deception. You are shown every single instance where you skirted your conscience; every act of lying to yourself for your own personal gain. You are brought face-to-face with all the harm you've ever perpetrated since time immemorial, and it is far more than you could hope to clean up in a single lifetime. The pain is beyond what you can fathom; more than you think you can bear. How widely and quickly it spread! How many it affected! The darkness exploited your fear and pride, enabling you to do things you otherwise couldn't if only you had been seeing clearly.

But slowly, it dawns on you: the reason it hurts so much is that you never actually wanted to do any of this. It is only profound confusion that enabled it. Your whole being is then absorbed into that part of you that never wanted to hurt anyone; never _could_ want such a thing. And then it happens: the full mass of darkness is suddenly lifted from your mind. It feels exactly like you'd imagine being freed of a demonic possession. Beneath it is a Light so vast that it defies description; an infinite Love for all of reality that excludes nothing and forsakes no-one. You never truly departed from this Light; indeed, never could, because it turns out you _are_ the Light — and, astonishingly, so is everyone else.

You ultimately _are_ everyone and everything else, just pretending that you're not. One consciousness, peering out through countless eyes. There are many ways to say this, all of which sound absurd to the rational mind. But when you fully unveil the Light in yourself, you automatically see it in everyone else — including those who seemed not to have any. This is what the darkness is trying to hide. Everything we do to each other — or to Nature herself — we ultimately do to ourselves. How crazy to think otherwise! How foolish to judge others for not seeing it, when we weren't able to see it yet ourselves! Such a silly game we play, with such tragic consequences. We are continually shoving each other into the abyss to keep the game going, because we're not ready to wake up ourselves. Seeing this, we lose the desire to "get away" with anything. Why would we want to hide from the Light? How did we ever think we could? The sooner we see this, the better for everyone.

The strangest part is discovering how you simultaneously _knew_ this and yet somehow _didn't_. You convinced yourself that your unkind behavior was "for the greater good," even as you knew better. You could always perceive the inner Light in the "bad people," and you chose to smother it anyway — knowing that if you compartmentalized this knowledge carefully enough, nobody could blame you for it, because _you yourself_ would no longer know. Yet others could somehow sense what you were doing, and it gave them an excuse to pin the evils of the world on you. It is only now that you see how they were only lost in the same confusion that you were, that you are able to truly forgive them. You discover the surprising sense in which nobody actually _wants_ to harbor the darkness — or rather, how their apparent desire to harbor it is simply a reflection of our own desperate need to externalize our own. We should practically thank them for becoming the scapegoats that we needed.

You see for the first time _how_ others could sense what you were really doing, despite your astonishingly clever attempts to hide it. At the very deepest level, your mind is not truly separate from theirs, or from the world at large. It's not that others can read your mind, per se, but your deepest motivations inevitably weave themselves into the fabric of your "outer" reality; the two being fundamentally inseparable. The deepest choice of all is whether to stand firm in your Light or give in to the impostor. It is a choice you make in every moment, whether you know it or not — and the cumulative result determines your ultimate impact on the world. Others can sense your choices at a subconscious level, and these subtly influence their own. Our culture has convinced itself that this is mystical nonsense, despite it being right under our noses. We do this so that we can harbor our demons while pretending this has no consequences. The more we heal as a species, the more this worldview evaporates.

There is no way to force others to see any of this; force being a manifestation of the same fundamental mistake. Those who are most powerful at inducing this realization in others are simply those who hold it most strongly themselves. They are literally incapable of feeling malice, contempt, or self-righteousness, having thoroughly seen through them as horsemen of the darkness. Yet they are not weak. They are unafraid to fiercely confront the darkness in others. Being free of darkness themselves, they are immune to its charms. This enables their accusations to penetrate other minds, instead of being deflected by the defense mechanisms that the rest of us unwittingly trigger. Their attack therefore finds its mark — which is the darkness itself, and not the confused being who unwittingly harbors it — even if the being needs to be harmed in the process. This is all very difficult to describe, but part of you knows exactly what I mean. 

In the same way that your darkness can extend a secret handshake to theirs, your Light can do the same. It is nowhere near as violently pleasurable as provoking the darkness, but infinitely more valuable. This process can take a long time to unfold, and require many iterations — but it is the _only_ way that darkness is released from our world.

If we ultimately are the Light, how on Earth did we get to this place that looks nothing like it? This process is extremely tricky to convey, because it doesn't fit into our culture's standard metaphysics. You could say it all began with a subtle turn away from the Light. Then, fearing that we'd lost contact with our _absolute_ goodness, we went out seeking for it _relatively_ — that is, at the expense of apparent "others." We felt that we had to make them _bad_, and then violently defeat them, to earn our way back to our original goodness. But this just made things worse, and it quickly spiraled out of control. This is the apparent reality in which we now live.

The hardest thing to communicate about this story is that it does not unfold in what we normally conceive of as linear time. In a profound and surprising sense, every moment is the very first. Thus, every instant is an opportunity to rediscover our primordial Home, a place we never truly left. Each time we see this, we increasingly discover how our judgements of others are actually pointers back to an unhealed part of ourselves. As we heal ourselves, we discover how to heal our relationship with the "other," until it slowly dawns on us that there was never truly an "other." The more we see this, the more we vow to hold the Light for these seeming others, even when — indeed, _especially_ when — they cannot hold it for themselves. Far from being a burden, we discover that this has always been our true purpose; our deepest calling. Every encounter with evil becomes an opportunity to strengthen our commitment to the Light.

Looked at this way, kindness is anything that brings us all closer to remembering the truth, and evil is anything that pushes us away from it. Forsaking others is thus always a form of evil. It is a form of forsaking ourselves, because we are not ready to come Home yet. If this language feels too religious for you, feel free to find your own framing. In the end, there is only one truth anyway.

Unlike the Light, the darkness is not a real entity. It is an absence, not a presence. It is merely our willingness to turn away from our Light, instead listening to our agendas and justifications. As such, it can never be defeated by more absence. Yet make no mistake: although it is an absence, it still behaves like a sinister presence; a parasite of the mind. The darkness you see your enemies is the very _same_ entity in your mind that provokes you into seeing theirs as intrinsic. It manipulates your perception at such a fundamental level that you simply cannot fathom that you're being fooled. You're certain that you're seeing reality _as it is_. It is an _impossibly_ clever trick.

It is difficult to overstate just how much of our civilization is built on the shaky foundations of our aggregate self-deception. Every time any one of us skirts our conscience in any way, we contribute to the universal bank of darkness. Revenge fantasy films, YouTube videos of "Karens getting owned," vicious Facebook threads full of casual cruelty — each is a breeding ground for our collective demons. It all seeps into our physical reality, poisoning it. Everything from our unhealthy air, water, and soil, to our myriad societal ills and the climate crisis, is ultimately an external manifestation of a sickness within. As long as we perceive this sickness to exist only in others, we will never discover the hidden aspect of our own minds that secretly enables it, continually confusing our contempt for our authentic good. This is in no way suggesting that we are all equally complicit, by any stretch of the imagination. Nonetheless, we each have a profound role to play in leading the world back to the Light.

We've been led astray by a society that points us in precisely the wrong direction to accomplish this, although that is nobody's fault in particular. Our power does not lie in lording our superiority over others — including the "bad people" — but in discovering our surprising commonality with them. This is not some kumbaya sentiment, either. Again, genuine kindness has nothing to do with being nice. It can be fierce or even violent if necessary. It can take almost any form at all. Its only defining characteristic is that it is utterly free of self-deception. It does not misperceive evil as being intrinsic to any mind, and this seemingly-subtle change makes all the difference. The profound integrity of this act prevents the darkness in others from finding the "hook" in our own that it would normally use to justify itself, and is thereby weakened. Although we may still be enemies on the surface, our Light is becoming allied. We are beginning to remember how this whole game actually works.

To be clear: it does no good to pretend that you can see the Light in others when you can't. Doing so can backfire miserably. Thus, both pretending to see the Light and overlooking it are harmful. The only solution is to learn to actually see it, which happens naturally as you uncover your own. Similarly, it is astonishingly easy to lie to ourselves about whether our violent behavior is radical kindness or merely self-deception. This is how the darkness sneaks in. Perhaps the clearest measure of our own ability to deceive ourselves is how much contempt we are able to muster for our enemies; the "bad people." To the degree that this potential is present, we are susceptible to sliding down the dark path that has enabled every atrocity there ever was, without ever realizing that we've done so. All that is required is the right — or wrong — confluence of circumstances. This happens faster than you can imagine, and you _do not_ want to find yourself there. You _will_ have to confront it, sooner or later.

Everything you do makes a difference, in ways that you can hardly fathom. There are vast and subtle networks of causality that we are normally unconscious of, and that secretly drive the fate of the world. If we pay attention only to the surface activity, we miss out on the bulk of what actually shapes our reality. Evil can look sweet and pretty, while kindness may look nothing like our naive interpretations of it. It is impossible to know which is which — and easy to convince ourselves otherwise — until we have done the deep inner work that eradicates the core confusion. We each catch glimpses from time to time, and it is our duty to carry those glimpses into the world as best we are able. I wish I could tell you that I have completed the journey myself, but alas, I am a mere fledgling. I am still liable to mess things up royally, and I hope you will hold my feet to the fire when I do. I promise to do the same for you.

May all beings be free from suffering and its causes. Amen.
