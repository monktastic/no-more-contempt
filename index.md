We know that being kind is the "right thing to do" in most situations, but things get hazy when it comes to "bad" people. Not only is it hard to be kind to them, but it's a bit unclear _why_ and even _whether_ we should. At the same time, there are many people today who seem to be "bad" enough for this question to be relevant to us. They may not deserve our cruelty (yet), but they surely deserve our contempt. It feels like the _least_ we could do as decent people.

But what if there is a sense in which kindness (properly defined) is _always_ the right thing to do, and this "innocent" deviation from it is responsible for tremendously more suffering than we realize? 

This site is a collection of pieces exploring that theme.

Before we begin, what is contempt? It is easier to describe than define.

Imagine you are debating politics with someone whom you at first trust is well-intentioned. Slowly, as their position is revealed, you begin to doubt their intentions. Eventually, you become convinced that they could only believe these things if they were _fundamentally morally defective_.

It is this _fundamental-ness_ that is the defining characteristic of contempt, whether the defect itself is moral or not. Genocides are carried out when people believe their victims are _fundamentally_ sub-human[^genocide] (and not merely humans with "worse" religions or ethnicities). While our own contempt may not rise to the level of enabling atrocities — yet — it is a milder form of the same phenomenon. In this dark place, all goodwill is lost.

Mocking our political enemies is fun because we get to see them hurt, quite independently of whether the behavior is a net good — though of course we must tell ourselves that it is one. Our "victim" cannot be fixed, so it is only right to punish them — and what more humane way to punish someone than to subtly communicate, through our eyes and voice, how worthless they are? That is how it usually starts, but rarely how it ends.

The feeling can also be much more subtle and brief, as when we mutter "idiot" under our breath at a bad driver. But if left unchecked, this attitude becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy. Perhaps a part of us secretly _wants_ that...

[^genocide]: The Nazis referred to Jews as 'vermin' and during the genocide in Rwanda, Tutsis were referred to as 'cockroaches.' This is a common pattern throughout history.
