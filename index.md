Kindness is the hardest word to define, but also the most important. It doesn't mean being nice. Nice means pleasant and agreeable, which can actually be harmful in certain situations. Kindness is something much more profound. It is the right motivation in literally _every_ circumstance. But how could kindness be the correct response to evil?

Our usual instinct is to be nasty to perpetrators. We may have the good sense not to be overtly cruel, but we often can't help but inject at least a little bit of darkness into our interactions. We reason that as long as it produces a positive outcome — such as suppressing their misbehavior — that it's not actually dark in the first place. What could be wrong with harboring a bit of malice or contempt in our hearts, after all? They aren't externally visible, and therefore could have no effect on the world. And anyway, it's our right to feel how we do. But the darkness is infinitely more clever than you can fathom. Simply by harboring it, you are telegraphing to your enemy that you are under its malevolent sway. This provokes the darkness in them, which you then use as proof that you were right about them, thereby licensing escalation. Part of you _knows_ that this will be the outcome — but it's so cleverly disguised that nobody will be able to blame you for it. It is the perfect crime.

If you look carefully enough into your mind while feeling contempt for _anyone_ — that is, the sense that they are _fundamentally_ defective, and that you are _intrinsically_ superior — you will discover that its secret purpose is to shove them deeper _into_ the abyss; to _smother_ their inner Light, so that you can convince yourself that they _have_ no such Light. In this dark place, cruelty becomes righteous, and you _will_ overlook the harmful and self-serving aspects of your own actions and agendas. It is completely inevitable. This is impossibly dark behavior, and yet we never recognize it as such. Or more precisely, part of us _does_ recognize it, but we don't let this knowledge reach conscious awareness.

This is the secret mechanism behind _all the evil there ever was_. "Bad people" know perfectly well when they are doing wrong, but this knowledge is carefully shielded from conscious self-reflection, so that it doesn't _feel_ wrong. The reason we hate them is not to _expose_ their darkness, but to force them to suppress it even harder, so that we have something external to blame for the sorry state of the world. The whole purpose of contempt is to help us hide our own darkness from ourselves.

Kindness is any behavior that brings the darkness to Light, and evil is anything that hides it. Every act of unkindness is secretly an attempt to drive other people's self-deception deeper into their minds, and is therefore evil. If you are perceptive enough while behaving this way, you will discover that you somehow already knew this, but couldn't admit it to yourself. It is itself an act of profound self-deception; of hiding from your Light. This alone would have told you that it would only produce more evil, no matter how convincingly it claims otherwise. Every time any one of us acts from self-deception, we induce the same tendency in everyone else. This is how the darkness spreads, without anyone recognizing their own complicity. The "trick" to remaining kind — if you can call it that — is to never depart from your inner Light under any circumstances. If there is even a trace of malice, contempt, or self-righteousness anywhere in your heart, it _will_ darken the world — and part of you will always know it.

There can be moments in life — such as during psychedelic trips, near-death experiences, or deep meditation or prayer — when you are confronted with the full depths of your own self-deception. You are shown every single instance where you skirted your conscience in any way; every act of lying to yourself for your own personal gain. You stand face-to-face with all the harm you've ever perpetrated since time immemorial, and it is far more than you could hope to clean up in a single lifetime. The pain is beyond what you can fathom, or think you can bear. How widely and quickly it spread! How many it affected! The darkness exploited your fear and pride, enabling you to do things you otherwise couldn't if only you had been seeing clearly.

But slowly, it dawns on you: the reason it hurts so much is that you never actually wanted to do this. It is only profound confusion that enabled it. Your whole being is absorbed into that part of you that never wanted to hurt anyone; never _could_ want such a thing. And then it happens: the full mass of darkness is suddenly lifted from your mind. It feels exactly like you'd imagine being freed of a demonic possession. Beneath it is a Light so vast that it defies description; an infinite Love for all of reality that excludes nothing and forsakes no-one — including the targets of its fearsome wrath, should that be necessary. You could never truly depart from your Light, because it turns out you _are_ the Light — and, astonishingly, so is everyone else.

It turns out you ultimately _are_ everyone and everything else, just pretending that you're not. One consciousness, peering out through countless eyes. There are many ways to say this, all of which sound absurd to the rational mind. But when you fully unveil the Light in yourself, you automatically see it in everyone else — including those who seemed not to have any. This is what the darkness is trying to hide. Everything we do to each other — or to Nature herself — we ultimately do to ourselves. How crazy to think otherwise! How foolish to hate others for not seeing it yet, when such hatred is exactly the same mistake! Such a silly game we play, with such tragic consequences. Humanity has trapped itself in the ultimate Mexican standoff.

The strangest part is discovering how you simultaneously _knew_ all this and yet somehow _didn't_. You convinced yourself that your unkind behavior was "for the greater good," even as part of you knew that it would only spread darkness. You could perceive the inner Light in the "bad people," but you chose to smother it anyway — knowing that if you compartmentalized this knowledge carefully enough, nobody could blame you or make you feel guilty for it, because _you yourself_ would no longer know. Yet others could somehow sense what you were really doing, and they pounced on this chance to pin the evils of the world on you. It is only now that you see how they were only lost in the same confusion that you were that you are able to truly forgive them. You discover the surprising sense in which nobody actually _wants_ to harbor the darkness — or rather, how their apparent desire to harbor it is but a mirror image of our own desire to see it as _intrinsic_ to them.

You see for the first time _how_ others could sense what you were really doing, despite your astonishingly clever attempts to hide it. At the very deepest level, your mind is not truly separate from theirs, or from the world at large. It's not that others can read your mind, per se, but your deepest motivations invariably weave themselves into the very fabric of your "outer" reality; the two being fundamentally inseparable — and the very deepest choice of all is whether to stand by your inner Light or to turn away from it. You make this choice in every moment, whether you know it or not — and the cumulative result determines your ultimate impact on the world. Others sense these choices at a subconscious level, and it subtly influences their own. Our culture has convinced itself that this is mystical nonsense, and now you see why. We still struggle to give up our own demons, and so we cling to a worldview that convinces us that harboring them can have no external consequences.

There is no way to force others to see any of this; force being a manifestation of the same fundamental mistake. Those who are most powerful at inducing this realization in others are simply those who hold it most strongly themselves. They are literally incapable of feeling malice, contempt, or self-righteousness, having thoroughly seen through them as horsemen of the darkness. Something about their presence enables our own hidden darkness to come to Light. Make no mistake: this is not always a gentle process. They may have to fiercely confront us and hold us to account. It may require tough love, but crucially, it is still Love — and something in us can sense the difference. There is no trace of intention to shove us deeper in. Our mind searches desperately for a way to attack them in return, but, as their mind is free of darkness, our accusation finds no footing. We are given no option but to look within, where we cannot help but discover what they were pointing to. They weren't attacking _us_, but only our shared nemesis. To save face, we may still perceive them as enemies, but something within us has shifted imperceptibly. This process can take a long time to unfold, but it is the _only_ way the darkness is released from our world.

If we ultimately are the Light, how on Earth did we get here? This process is extremely tricky to convey, because it doesn't fit into our culture's default metaphysics. You could say it all began with a subtle turn away from the Light. Then, fearing that we'd lost contact with our _absolute_ goodness, we went out seeking for it _relatively_ — that is, at the expense of apparent "others." We felt that we had to make them _bad_, and then violently defeat them, to earn our way back to our original goodness — and as we did so, it spiraled out of control. This is the apparent reality in which we now live.

The hardest thing to communicate about this story is that it does not unfold in what we normally conceive of as linear time. In a profound and surprising sense, every moment is the very first. Thus, every instant is an opportunity to rediscover our primordial Home — a place we never truly left. Each time we see this, we increasingly discover how our judgements of others are actually pointers back to an unhealed part of ourselves. As we heal ourselves, we discover how to heal our relationship with the "other," until it slowly dawns on us that there was never truly an "other." The more we see this, the more we vow to hold the Light for these seeming others, even when — indeed, _especially_ when — they cannot hold it for themselves. Far from being a burden, we discover that this has always been our true purpose; our deepest calling.

Thus, kindness is anything that brings us all closer to remembering the truth, and evil is anything that pushes us away from it. Forsaking others is always a form of evil. It is only forsaking ourselves because we are not ready to come Home yet. If this language feels too religious for you, feel free to find your own framing. In the end, there is only one truth anyway.

The darkness is ultimately nothing but our willingness to turn away from our inner Light, instead listening to our agendas and justifications. Yet make no mistake: although it is an absence, it still behaves like a sinister presence; like a parasite of the mind. The darkness you see your enemies is the very _same_ entity in your mind that provokes you into seeing theirs as intrinsic. It manipulates your perception at such a fundamental level that you simply cannot fathom that you're being fooled. You're certain that you're seeing reality _as it is_. It is an _impossibly_ clever trick.

This is why we sometimes fear the existence of an evil global conspiracy running the world from behind the scenes. The darkness in our minds is indeed conspiring, together behaving like a singular _distributed malevolent entity_, manipulating all of humanity from beneath our conscious thresholds. The Christians know it as the Devil, and the Buddhists call it the ego. You can treat it as a metaphor, but it is also as real as anything you can touch. It is the _primordial_ evil conspiracy; the one to which all the rest owe their existence, and to which they ultimately filter up. The reason we never seem able to fully unveil it is that it lives deep within the crevices of our own minds. It keeps our attention fixated perpetually outward, on the evil "out there," so that we will never look "in here," at the one place where we can actually defeat it. Every attempt to subdue it externally without being free of it internally just gives it more power. It cannot be any other way.

It is impossible to overstate just how much of our current civilization is built on the shaky foundations of our collective self-deception. Everything from our unhealthy air, water, and soil, to our deep societal ills, is ultimately an external manifestation of a sickness within. It is the root cause of our climate crisis. As long as we perceive this sickness to exist only in other people, we will never discover the hidden aspect of ourselves that has been secretly enabling it, even as the bulk of our mind convinces us that we were fighting it. This is in no way suggesting that we are all equally complicit by any stretch. Far from it. Yet we each have a surprising amount of untapped potential in leading the world back to the Light.

We've been led astray by a society that points us in precisely the wrong direction to accomplish this. Our power does not lie in our superiority over others — including the "bad people" — but in our ultimate commonality with them. This is not some kumbaya sentiment, either. As mentioned before, genuine kindness has nothing to do with being nice. It can be fierce or even violent if necessary. It can look like almost anything at all. Its only defining characteristic is that it is utterly free of self-deception.  It does not perceive evil as intrinsic to any mind, and this seemingly-subtle change makes all the difference. It surgically targets the parasite itself, instead of the confused being who unwittingly harbors it. The profound integrity of this act prevents their darkness from finding the "hook" in our own that it would normally use to justify itself, and is thereby weakened.

To be clear: it does no good to pretend that you can see the Light in others when you cannot. This can backfire miserably, as it rapidly degrades into merely being _nice._ Thus, both pretending to see the good in others and overlooking it are harmful. The only solution is to learn to actually see it, and the only way to do that is to fully uncover our own, by whatever means necessary. At the same time, it is astonishingly easy to lie to ourselves about whether we are wielding fierce compassion or merely pretending to. Perhaps the clearest measure of our own ability to deceive ourselves is how much contempt we are able to muster for our enemies; the "bad people." As long as this potential is present, we are liable to slide down the dark path that has enabled every atrocity there ever was. All that is required is the right — or wrong — confluence of circumstances. This happens faster than you can imagine, and you _do not_ want to find yourself there. You _will_ have to confront it, sooner or later.

There are vast and subtle networks of causality that we are normally unconscious of, and that secretly drive the fate of the world. If we pay attention only to the surface activity, we miss out on the bulk of what actually shapes our reality. Evil can look sweet and pretty, while kindness may look nothing like our naive interpretations of it. It is impossible to know which is which — and easy to convince ourselves otherwise — until we have done the deep inner work that eradicates the core confusion. We each catch glimpses from time to time, and it is our sacred duty to carry those glimpses into the world as best we are able. I wish I could tell you that I have completed the journey myself, but alas, I am a mere fledgling. I am still liable to mess things up royally, and I hope you will hold my feet to the fire when I do. I promise to do the same for you.

May all beings be free from suffering and its causes. Amen.
