_Warning: This piece is about the nature of good and evil. It is **not** light reading._

---

Sometimes it is only after the fact that we discover that we _always_ knew that something was wrong, even when we thought that it wasn't. Thus it can happen that we come to deeply regret behaviors that felt completely okay at the time, realizing (to our horror) that part of us knew better even as we engaged in them.

So it is with _all_ acts of unkindness, in the final analysis.

Something within you knows that kindness is always the right approach in every situation — including the ones where it seems "obviously" wrong. There's a part of you that wants to respond to the evils of the world by hardening your heart and becoming a tiny bit evil yourself. Of course, you probably don't think of it as "being evil." We tend to call it righteous retribution. But something deep within you knows that what's really happening is that the evil out there is taking root in here.

Every single time you feel malice, hatred, contempt, or _even self-righteousness_ toward anyone — no matter how "evil" — you are preparing to do something that you know will ultimately harm the world. The difficulty is in getting yourself to admit this.

The faster we all get our act together, the better. The fate of humanity depends on it.

Consider [this horrifying story from 2012](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/southamerica/brazil/9005835/Loggers-burned-Amazon-tribe-girl-alive.html):

> _Loggers in Brazil captured an eight-year-old girl from one of the Amazon's last uncontacted tribes and burned her alive as part of a campaign to force the indigenous population from its land [...]_

Can you feel the profound anger and heartbreak for the girl, her tribe, and humanity? It makes you want to do everything in your power to ensure this kind of thing never happens again — including punishing and maybe even harming the perpetrators if need be. At the same time, you may feel a desire to harm them quite _independently_ of any good it will bring: pure old-fashioned vengeance.

These two motivations — compassion and malice — arise from very different aspects of mind, but can be extremely difficult to tell apart. We usually dress up the latter to make it seem respectable; like it is "for the greater good." We tell ourselves that it doesn't matter which intention is driving our behavior; that only the _result_ matters. In fact, because we are "good people," pretty much any behavior is good by definition so long as our target is even vaguely "bad." If pressed, we can produce calculations _proving_ that it will produce a net good.

This profound confusion is how evil sneaks into the world undetected.

_Before I speak to your mind, let me speak to your heart. Imagine how dark and twisted a mind has to become to feel okay about doing what those loggers did. If you introspect carefully enough, you will find that pushing such a mind deeper into the abyss is every bit as malevolent as burning a girl alive. But we carefully hide this truth from ourselves, to avoid confronting something that we'd be much better off dealing with immediately. This isn't a judgement of you. It's an attempt at communicating a horrifying punchline that part of us already knows is coming sooner or later._

We can't calculate all the downstream effects of even our tiniest behavior, but we _can_ know when we are being evil — and the greatest gift we can give to the world is healing whatever is causing this confused behavior.

</p>

As much as we try to hide our underlying motivations — even from ourselves — other people are _exquisitely_ sensitive to them, if only subconsciously. Malice makes us look evil — _because it is_, as we shall see — and it powerfully evokes _their_ malice in response.

Whatever storyline was justifying our target's behavior in the first place is now reinforced, because they can plausibly claim to be _fighting evil_. Our allies become more bloodlusted, too. Even if our nastiness suppresses our target's behavior (in public, anyway), the darkness has been embedded deeper into their mind — and this _will_ manifest in some way and ripple out into the world, where we will be able to disavow any connection to it.

The world becomes darker as a result. But this isn't an unfortunate side effect of our well-intentioned behavior: it was secretly orchestrated by a sinister aspect within our minds. The way this works is _insanely_ clever.

<p align="center" width="100%">
    <img width="300px" src="img/evil-above-world.png"> 
</p>

People are only able to misbehave due to a kind of self-deception: part of them knows perfectly well that what they're doing is wrong, but that "wrongness" is cleverly hidden from conscious self-reflection. Part of us knows this, and that our malice will only exacerbate the problem, but we hide this knowledge from ourselves — because our identity as "good people" depends on them not "seeing the light," and who could blame us for not helping them see it? _This is self-deception_ — which makes them perceive us as evil for precisely the same reason that we did them, triggering a downward spiral into Hell.

It's not merely _harming_ them that caused this spiral, but the malice with which we did it. It is entirely possible to harm people out of fierce compassion for the world, but it feels nothing like malice. Others can sense the profoundly benevolent intent, and it prevents their self-deception mechanism from finding the "hook" it needs to reinforce itself. In fact, it may well plant the seed of introspection, which will _weaken_ the source of evil. Your example matters far more than you know.

<p align="center" width="100%">
    <img width="300px" src="img/devil-vs-devil.png"> 
</p>

If it is really this simple, then why aren't we already doing it?

Part of us _knows_ that we're not intrinsically better than anyone — but given how low people can sink, this is painful to admit, so we hide it. We use malice to keep people trapped in delusion, so that we can stay safely morally superior. Unfortunately, pushing people into the dark is hardly "morally superior," so we must hide this, too, in an ever-tightening noose of deception that collapses in on itself like a black hole, preventing us from ever suspecting what we're really doing.

Somewhere down this dark path, we will lose even the _pretense_ of being good. That's where the "evil people" are trapped. The only way to inoculate yourself against it is to see how susceptible you are to it — and it begins with seeing how it arises in the first place.

> _And no wonder, for even Satan masquerades as an angel of light._ —2 Corinthians 11:14

You know the classic image of the angel and devil sitting on our shoulders? It's _almost_ accurate, except for two things. First, the angel isn't really external to you, but represents your true nature as compassion. In a deep sense, it *is* you (as we will discover later). The devil is external; a kind of parasite[^intrinsic]. But it doesn't just whisper obviously-bad ideas in your ear; it alters your very perception and pretends to be your inner angel.

<p align="center" width="100%">
    <img width="300px" src="img/parasite.png"> 
</p>

> _Be kind, for everyone you meet is fighting a great battle._ —Author unknown

Your angel already knows all this, and that even the most "evil" person is really under the sway of a parasite; one held in place by some "battle" invisible not only to you, but probably even to them. As hard as it may be to evict, it's never _impossible._ Your devil makes it _appear_ impossible; as though their evil is intrinsic. They seem _fundamentally defective_. This triggers our deep-seated (but ham-fisted) instinct of "see evil, smash evil."

Your devil _also_ knows that this instinct appears evil to others (because it _is_), and so it knows that it will trigger the same reflex in them. It knows this because your devil and theirs are identical. In fact, they're not just identical, but behave more like outgrowths of a single collective entity that is continually manipulating _all_ of our minds — the Devil, if you will.

<p align="center" width="100%">
    <img width="300px" src="img/shared-devil.png"> 
</p>

This is not just a religious invention: anyone who introspects carefully enough eventually perceives this "distributed malevolent entity" with a kind of intelligence and volition of its own that, even if not _literally_ true, explain its seemingly-coordinated behavior terrifyingly well. 

This "being" continually drives humanity toward various kinds of Armageddon: situations in which everyone can violently prove how righteous they are once and for all. It is why the US is headed toward civil war without anyone recognizing their own complicity, and why there are bitter [divorces](https://www.gottman.com/blog/this-one-thing-is-the-biggest-predictor-of-divorce/) in which each side feels like the exclusive victim / hero. Nearly the whole world is caught in its terrible sway, evil provoking "righteous" evil at nearly every turn without anyone ever suspecting the true cause.

It is that primordial "evil global conspiracy" to which all the rest ultimately owe their existence — and _we_ are its unwitting minions. Every attempt to maliciously subdue it "out there" just strengthens it, because such behavior is only ever initiated _by_ it, though it makes us believe that it was initiated by us in the service of good.

**Any** time you feel malice, hatred, contempt, or self-righteousness toward another being; any time you see them as fundamentally defective or inferior; any time you are tempted to divide the world into the (fundamentally) "good" and "bad," or to forsake anyone, you are feeding them to the Beast.

<p align="center" width="100%">
    <img width="300px" src="img/good-vs-bad.png"> 
</p>

To be clear: there are surely groups of particularly deluded people who conspire to cause great harm, but their existence wouldn't be possible if the rest of us weren't feeding the source — and conversely, it is _inevitable_ given that we are. **We must hold such people accountable**, but when we do this with contempt, we are reinforcing the conditions that effectively _compel_ their existence. If you look closely enough, you will find your finger in countless evil pies.

Our true enemy is not other people, but the dark "entity" that has captured _all_ of our minds. By keeping our attention fixated perpetually outward, it ensures that we never introspect deeply enough to notice this. This distraction is roughly what the Buddhists call the ego: the collection of habits we have developed to overlook our intimate interconnection with all of reality.

> *The shadow is a moral problem that challenges the whole ego-personality, for no one can become conscious of the shadow without considerable moral effort. To become conscious of it involves recognizing the dark aspects of the personality as present and real. This act is the essential condition for any kind of self-knowledge.* —Carl Jung

The only way out of this trap is to see beyond the ego, to your fundamentally compassionate nature. When you see this, you cannot help but see it in everyone else, too — because in an astonishing and heart-wrenching sense, [everyone is _you_](unity.md). This perception is not fully unveiled until enlightenment, but we can all taste it at all times. Ultimately, all self-deception boils down to willful ignorance of this fact — and all unkindness reinforces it. Why "willful"? Because you eventually discover that _part of you has known this all along._ This piece is merely a reminder.

From that clarity of perception, you cannot possibly harbor malice or contempt. That enables you to perceive the hidden causes of people's self-deception, allowing you to do something real about it. That's what compassion (aka kindness) is.

To repeat: it doesn't mean being _nice_. It can outwardly be as fierce (or violent[^dalai-lama-gun], or even _apparently_ contemptuous) as the situation warrants, but these behaviors come from a completely different source. People can sense your motivation even when you think they can't — in fact, sometimes even when _you_ (consciously) can't — and it makes all the difference in the world.

_This_ is why wise people urge compassion for evildoers: the only alternative is to be evil.

Compassion doesn't always know what the most beneficial behavior _is_; it merely ensures that you are not falling into the many seductive traps of your darkness. Determining the most effective behavior requires _wisdom_, which is a vast topic, and beyond the scope of this work. Compassion may be no easier to acquire, but it is much simpler: there is a single place within your mind that you can turn to and _know._ So much trouble could be avoided if we just looked — especially when we least felt the need to.

> *Such a man knows that whatever is wrong in the world is also in himself, and if he only learns to deal with his own shadow, he has done something real for the world. He has succeeded in shouldering at least an infinitesimal part of the gigantic, unsolved problems of our day.* —Carl Jung

</p>

Enlightenment may be a lofty goal to expect of humanity, but we can start small, by changing social norms. We can teach our children the difference between "kind" and "nice," and explain the sense in which kindness is _always_ the right motivation in all circumstances. We can refuse to join our allies when they're caught up in the traps of contempt[^contempt] and malice, and serve as an example of a better way.

> *Nail on the head brother. My most recent mushroom trip (also the largest dose I've ever taken) I became fixated on a news story I had heard that week. About an 8 year old girl from a tribe in the Amazon, who was tied to a tree and burned alive in order to scare her people off their land so it could be logged. I realized that at the moment he did it, whoever lit that gasoline actually felt / thought more or less okay about what he was doing. **And my mind was illuminated with dozens of the parallels between that man's malformed, horrific perceptual / behavioral state, and mine. I saw the same mistakes in value attribution, the same willful ignorance of the consequences of my acts and words. And there was nothing I could do to deny the similarity.***

## Footnotes

[^contempt]: Specifically, we mean (genuine) contempt for *people*. Contempt for ideas or behaviors can actually be healthy, as perhaps can (apparent) contempt that is rooted in genuine compassion.

[^intrinsic]: You may wonder how it is possible to know that evil is not intrinsic to other people's minds, but for our purposes it's more important to see that (1) our _perception_ of their intrinsic defectiveness is our own projection, and (2) our own darkness gives us the capacity to devolve into a condition in which others would be utterly convinced that _ours_ is intrinsic.

[^dalai-lama-gun]: The Dalai Lama was once asked what you should do if a gunman is trying to shoot you and you have a gun. [He said "shoot back."](https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/dalai-gun/)
