> _For so long as the root of wickedness is hidden, it is strong. But when it is recognized, it is dissolved. When it is revealed, it perishes. ... It is powerful because we have not recognized it._ — The Gospel of Philip

Consider the "bad people" of the world — the murderers, rapists, child abusers; the greedy bankers, hypocritical CEOs, corrupt politicians, etc. Don't they seem *fundamentally different* from the rest of us — as though they are somehow *intrinsically* morally defective? Sure, the rest of us may occasionally get up to some trouble, but it's not the same thing at all.

The truth is that the aspect of your mind that lets you believe this is precisely the same aspect that allows the "bad people" to do what *they* do — and by giving in to yours, you *reinforce* that same capacity in them. This requires a bit of unpacking.

Think back to a time when you skirted your conscience — that is, behaved in a way that went against your own deepest values, but somehow convinced yourself was okay. It can be hard to admit that you've done this, but we all have. In that state, part of you knew *perfectly well* that you were doing wrong, but this knowledge was carefully hidden from conscious self-reflection, so that it didn't *feel* wrong. All you consciously heard were your own clever justifications.

It is precisely this state that has enabled *all the evil there ever was,* from the tiniest act of unkindness to the most horrific atrocity — and any time any one of us engages in it, we strengthen that same capacity in everyone else. By its very nature, the vast majority of this behavior is hidden from our conscious minds, so that we only see the very tip of the iceberg.

> _Be kind, for everyone you meet is fighting a great battle._ —Author unknown

Reflect on how it feels to mock and shame your political enemies. Part of you *knows* that you're judging them for a flaw that you yourself are highly susceptible to — but this is nearly impossible to admit. At the same time, your enemy can sense that this is what's really happening, and so it makes them see *you* as evil in response. This, in turn, convinces you that you were *right* about them: after all, only a *fundamentally defective* person could think that *you* are the evil one here.

The darkness in your mind — the thing that allows you to hide from your own conscience — is infinitely more clever than you can fathom. It secretly orchestrated this whole ruse. It hides itself perfectly from your own mind while sensitizing you to its presence in others, precisely so that you will treat them with contempt, thereby *strengthening* its grip on both of you, while leaving you each feeling like you were acting righteously.

This is an incredibly subtle point, and one that's easy to misunderstand. In fact, the darkness *needs* you to misunderstand. Of course evil actions must be "judged" — so long as judgement simply means wise discernment. And appropriate action must be taken, even if it requires outwardly violent behavior. None of this by itself creates darkness. But there is a kind of "inward violence" — best captured by the word *contempt* — that always sullies even the most well-intended behavior. This is contempt not just for beliefs or behaviors but for *people themselves*.

The hallmark of evil is that the perpetrator's mind is shielding them from perceiving the *life* in their victims — be they other people, animals, or nature at large. There can be moments in life — such as in deep meditation, or on psychedelics, or near-death experiences — where one can be shown the full depth of depravity possible in a mind. It is a profoundly harrowing experience. At the same time, one discovers that it is **exactly** the same trick that has enabled one's own contempt for the "bad people." Hating them is how I hide my own self-deception from myself, thereby ensuring that I never heal the one bit of darkness I actually have full power over.

Believe me when I say that **nothing** is more painful than being shown how I've been shoving my fellow beings deeper into the abyss while claiming not to know what I was doing. I've been *smothering* their inner Light by pretending they don't have any. This makes me the **ultimate** hypocrite. I saw how every bit of news that triggers my contemptuous outrage is actually a place where my *own* unkindness has leaked out into the world, enabling me to safely judge it from afar. Again, the key word is *contemptuous.* There is nothing wrong with outrage, per se.

The darkness *needs* you to see yourself as different and special — if only in the sense of being "good person" — because once you do, the rest is all but guaranteed. It is always the same trick, and it always has the same effect. You *will* license yourself to engage in subtly self-serving behaviors that you will not recognize as such — and by doing so, secretly license others to do the same. And because you won't know that you've done this, you will then judge them for it, reinforcing the whole cycle without any awareness of your own complicity.

> _And no wonder, for even Satan masquerades as an angel of light. So it is not strange that his ministers also masquerade as ministers of righteousness._ —2 Corinthians 11:14-16

This is why some people fear the existence of an "evil global conspiracy" pulling the strings behind the scenes. The darkness in of all of our minds is indeed conspiring, behaving more like a singular *distributed malevolent entity*. The Christians know it as the Devil, and the Buddhists call it the Ego. It is the *primordial* evil conspiracy; the one to which all the rest owe their existence, and to which they all ultimately filter up. Every attempt to destroy it without being free of it yourself only ends up strengthening it, thus causing you to externalize it *even harder*.

This is why there is no substitute for evicting the darkness from your own mind first. Until then, you are always liable to run directly into this trap — and you will almost certainly not realize it until it's too late. You will then have to rely on someone wiser than yourself to help pull you out. Everyone else will be too busy contemptuously judging *you,* not realizing what *they* are doing.

The darkness is like a parasite — and like all parasites, it can be evicted. What lies underneath —what you ultimately *are* in your innermost being — is an infinite Love for all of Reality. Not a gentle, passive love, but a **ferocious compassion** that excludes nothing and forsakes no-one. It can manifest as fearsome wrath when necessary to protect the Whole, but its root is always Love; never malice or contempt.

This Love **is** all of Reality: One Life, peering through countless eyes, longing to come Home to itself; to remember itself. That is what you are — what everyone is — which is why your deepest longing is to be of service to the Whole. This is why any harm you cause others, or Nature herself, ultimately harms you; and why forsaking them ultimately only forsakes yourself.

To be clear: there are people whose infection runs so deep that naively "trying to see the good" in them can backfire miserably. Thus, pretending to see their Light when you can't, or believing they have none, both lead to terrible outcomes. The only solution is to learn to **actually** see it in them — a capacity that awakens naturally as you unveil the Light within yourself. The more you do this, the more you are able to subdue their darkness without accidentally reinforcing it. A mind that is free of self-deception simply cannot feel malice, contempt, or self-righteousness, no matter the circumstances, because it sees where these inevitably lead.

I know this may all sound bizarre, but part of you recognizes this truth, even if your mind describes it in different language. Find that part of you and trust it above all else. Everything that distracts from this inner knowing, every justification for contempt or self-deception, is a whisper from the darkness. By remaining steadfastly connected to this source of Good within, you not only heal yourself but contribute to the healing of the world – achieving far more in the true "fight against Evil" than all the cunning strategies your darkness could ever devise.

May all beings be free of suffering and its causes. Amen.
