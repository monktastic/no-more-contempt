Why are we unkind to people who we perceive as "bad"? The answer seems obvious: we do it to make the world a better place. But this is an insidious lie. It explains why we're not _nice_, but not why we're not _kind_. Nice is about being pleasant and agreeable, which are clearly unhelpful in some situations. But kindness means something much deeper. It is the right motivation in _every_ circumstance.

A healthy mind harbors no hostility under any circumstances. That's not because it is meek or even "tolerant" per se. It can be fierce or even violent in subduing evil. These can be forms of kindness too. But it cannot feel even a _trace_ of malice, contempt, or self-righteousness, because it has seen something clearly.

It has seen that those sentiments are lies: they exist *only* to help us get away with something that we otherwise could not. We want to behave in some way that is self-serving, which we couldn't do if we could see the full humanity of the person we are attacking. So a dark aspect of our mind tricks us into perceiving them as somehow _fundamentally defective_. That way, we won't feel bad harming them. It might not even be obvious what we're getting out of it. For some, it is financial gain or feelings of power, but very often it is (ironically) just to bolster our self-image as "good people," who therefore deserve to get away with more. A deep part of us recognizes this deceit, but we carefully hide it away from conscious self-reflection.

We feel like we are teaching the other person a lesson, but they may not even be (knowingly) doing anything wrong. They may be honestly doing the best they can, in which case we're harming an innocent person. But even if they _are_ knowingly doing wrong, it's only because they're under the sway of _precisely_ the same self-deception that we presently are. Either way, the only "lesson" they learn is that this world is a dark and phony place; that the Light is just a myth. Whatever temporary benefit we may achieve — such as suppressing their (public) misbehavior — this powerfully reinforces their self-deception. This in turn proves to _us_ that the world is a nasty place, thus requiring our "righteous" escalation.

You have _no idea_ how good your subconscious is at telegraphing your darkness to others while simultaneously hiding it from yourself. This combination sets up perfect feedback loop, in which you can trigger the darkness in others while convincing yourself that it's their fault. And this is far from the only way that your darkness leaks out. As long as you are harboring any hardness or hostility in your heart, it _will_ find its way into the world, one way or another, without your conscious knowledge. Except it's not truly unconscious: it is always available to consciousness, if we choose to look. The problem is that we _choose not to look_.

Here is the choice that confronts each one of us: to become aware of having chosen to look away — and thereby discover that this is how _all_ evil works, and that our self-righteous judgement therefore has no basis whatsoever — or to continue to delude ourselves, descending into deeper and deeper realms of self-deception, darkening the world in increasingly clever ways, ever-more convinced of our righteousness.

Evil is actually an absence masquerading as a presence. The absence of what? Of a particular insight.

The ultimate truth is that you are everyone and everything, in a profound and surprising sense. It is said that this is only fully realized upon _enlightenment,_ but all of us can sense it at all times, to some degree or another. Yet we hide it from ourselves. It is only by overlooking this astonishing truth that anyone is able to harm anyone else (or our planet), through objectification; dehumanization. This is the core of self-deception; the origin of all contempt; the root of all evil.

But although it is an absence, it behaves very convincingly like a presence. When you look in the eyes of someone in the grip of this delusion, you see the _presence_ of evil. This is the moment of truth. If you choose profound honesty, you will be forced to admit that the same potential exists within you, and you will gain at least some insight in how to alleviate theirs, commensurate with your willingness; your deep compassion. This will contribute to the healing of the world. Compassion is never truly "for" a person, but for everything at once.

Your darkness, on the other hand, seduces you into believing that you could never be like them; that you are _fundamentally superior_. If you accede, you will perceive them as _intrinsically defective_, thus inspiring contempt. Their darkness will instantly recognize itself in you, and the game is on. Now both yours and theirs are secretly _allied_, knowing that they can freely spread darkness in the world with the implicit permission of you, their hosts. You have both willingly gone unconscious; delegated your sovereignty.

It is that devil on your shoulder. It is a kind of mental parasite, fundamentally extrinsic to your mind. But unlike in the cartoons, it doesn't just whisper obviously-bad ideas into your ear. No, it alters your very perception so that other people's devils appear intrinsic. This way, you will feel justified in shoving them deeper into the abyss in the name of "good." Everyone else is treated sweetly and gingerly, as if to prove to ourselves and the world which team we are fighting for.

But our devils are more than just allied. With enough sensitivity, you will see that they behave more like outgrowths of a single distributed malevolent entity — the _Devil,_ if you will. It hides itself in our subconscious, flowing freely between minds, with none of us ever detecting its presence, convinced that we are uniquely immune to its sinister charms. It continually drives humanity toward various kinds of Armageddon: situations in which everyone is violently proving how _righteous_ they are. It is why the US is headed toward civil war without anyone suspecting their own complicity, and explains bitter [divorces](https://www.gottman.com/blog/this-one-thing-is-the-biggest-predictor-of-divorce/) in which each side feels like the exclusive victim / hero. Nearly the whole world is caught in its terrible sway, evil provoking "righteous" retribution at every turn, without anyone ever noticing the true source of it all.

It is said that the elites are playing us off each other to take attention off of them, but the Devil is playing a _much_ bigger game — one in which even the elites are merely pawns. It tricks you into hating them specifically so that you will empower it — and thereby empower _them_. It is the reason that nothing ever seems to change. It accomplishes this by convincing you that your compassion isn't powerful enough to combat their evil; that your darkness is required.

It is that "evil global conspiracy" that some people fear exists: a covert entity responsible for all the world's ills, that hides itself so perfectly that nobody ever suspects its existence, let alone that they are in on it. They cannot even see it when it is clearly and explicitly pointed out. It is _that_ good. It is the _primordial_ evil conspiracy; the one to which all the rest ultimately filter up, and to which they owe their existence. Every act of unkindness you've ever perpetrated on anyone; all the hardness you carry in your heart; has only ever been in its service. The evil conspiracy really exists, and (nearly) every one of us is secretly in on it. It is our refusal to acknowledge this that keeps it alive.

The only way to fight it is to stop playing its sordid game and remember a power that you have that is _far greater_.

The Light is not just a myth; it is your most fundamental nature. Whereas your devil is extrinsic, your compassion is _intrinsic._ It is the very root of who and what you are. When you discover this in its entirety, you see it in everyone else, too — because, after all, they _are_ you. It is your most sacred duty as a human to remember this, so that you can share it freely with others (though paradoxically, if you still see them as "other," and yourself as their noble savior, then this isn't quite it).

Your compassion is not weak — indeed, it is the most powerful force there is. It is the _only_ thing that can genuinely dispel evil, for precisely the same reason that light is the only thing that can dispel darkness: the latter is nothing but the _absence_ of the former. Yet treating it like a presence can be skillful, because then you will not underestimate its terrifying capacity to grip minds and bring the whole world to its knees. This compassion must be paired with _wisdom,_ which is the knowledge of how best to put it into fierce and uncompromising practice. That takes time to develop, and is beyond the scope of this piece. It is only with great wisdom that one can evict the darkness from the most infected of minds without getting sucked in oneself.

Such compassion may look nothing like "compassion" in the conventional sense. It can look like mocking or shaming, violence, or even _apparent_ contempt. Almost nothing is off-limits. Yet it has the opposite effect of the same actions undertaken with contempt. Two behaviors that look nearly identical on the surface can thus have dramatically different long-term effects; one sending ripples of darkness into the world, and the other of Light. Please forgive the poetic expression; I don't know how else to put it. But it is something you can discover concretely. The darkness preys on our inability to distinguish the two, which is how it convinces us that our intentions don't matter, that compassion is weak, and that contempt is righteous.

Our enemy is never truly other people, but the darkness that has overtaken all of our minds. May we learn to see this clearly, and free this world of the illusion that has overtaken it. May we remember our Light.
