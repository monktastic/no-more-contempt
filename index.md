We've all heard that "hate cannot drive out hate," but is it really true? What about something milder, like contempt? Surely contempt for _bad people_ can make the world a better place — certainly more so than being kind?

---

The truth is that every one of us engages in small (or not so small) behaviors to help ourselves gain an advantage at the expense of the world — and we have varying degrees of self-awareness about how and when (and even whether) we do this. Part of us knows _perfectly well_ that our behavior is wrong — according to our _own_ deepest standards, and not anyone else's — but that knowledge is very carefully shielded from conscious self-reflection; from the part of us that would put an end to it if only it knew. Instead, all we hear is our own clever justifications.

Of course, some people's behavior is so egregious that it's hard to believe that _any_ part of them doesn't know. It seems like even their "deepest standards" are rotten. But what's actually happening is that their self-deception is _especially_ powerful. If you want a world in which people don't act that way, you have to end the phenomenon of self-deception. Looking around at human behavior, this seems like an impossible task. People appear intrinsically selfish. But the truth is that we make it much harder than it has to be, by compounding it with our own self-deception.

If you look carefully enough into your mind while feeling malice, contempt[^contempt], or even self-righteousness, you'll find that they are _always_ self-deception: part of you is knowingly darkening the world in some way to benefit yourself. It might not even be obvious what you're getting out of it. For some people it is about financial gain or feelings of power, but very often it is (ironically) just to bolster our self-image as "good people" — who therefore deserve to get away with more.

[^contempt]: It is important to distinguish between contempt for ideas and behaviors, and for people themselves. The former can indeed be helpful.

When your contempt is directed at "bad people," they subconsciously recognize what you're actually doing, which makes them feel more justified in doing it themselves. This in turn proves to you that they really are delusional and irredeemable, which licenses you to escalate your righteous wrath. It is impossible to overstate how clever your subconscious is at telegraphing your darkness to others while hiding it from yourself, so that you can provoke them while convincing yourself that it's their fault. Your target doesn't even have to be present: any hardness or hostility that you harbor in your heart _will_ find its way into the world, one way or another, darkening it without your conscious knowledge. Unfortunately, it's not truly unconscious: it is always available to consciousness, if only we choose to look. But we _choose not to look_.

> _And no wonder, for even Satan masquerades as an angel of light. So it is not strange that his ministers also masquerade as ministers of righteousness._ —2 Corinthians 11:14-16
 
This is how we darken the world while supposedly "fighting evil." What's happening on the _surface_ of our minds affects reality far less than the stuff happening much deeper; in places that we may not even have conscious access to yet. It doesn't matter how noble your stated intentions are: if there's self-deception operating, you _will_ make the world a darker place; one more rife with self-deception — and you will be flawlessly convinced that you are helping. In fact, your behavior may actually _be_ helpful — at least for a time. It may temporarily suppress their misbehavior (in public, anyway), but under the surface, the darkness is spreading.

It would be unkind to blame you for this, even though part of you knows it fully well. That's because the very deepest part of you doesn't actually want to be doing it. But something in you feels that it doesn't have a choice; that the cruel world has forced your hand, and you're doing what you must. This is all completely understandable — for both you and literally everyone else, if you look hard enough. Everyone is caught in some version of the very same trap; some so deeply that we cannot recognize it. Your choice is to either shove them deeper in — which you will surely get away with, given how "righteous" it is in the eyes of the people you surround yourself with — or to help pull them out; to extend them the grace that you yourself so profoundly deserve — and to thereby rid the world of at least a tiny bit of "evil."

The latter is called _kindness_ or _compassion_. To be clear, it does **not** mean being nice, or gentle, or tolerant, or even understanding. It simply means being free of self-deception; of the pernicious illusion that you are somehow special and incorruptible. We judge[^judge] others because somewhere deep down we are judging ourselves. When the latter stops, the former does too — and the latter only ends when we have finally unearthed every last place in which we hide our true intentions from ourselves. Once this happens, it is literally impossible to feel contempt, because you see clearly that this sentiment exists _only_ to perpetuate dark patterns in the world; patterns that enable us all to avoid that within us which we're not yet ready to confront.

[^judge]: To be clear, "judgement" here means _contemptuous_ judgement. Judgement in the sense of wise discernment is of course good. Another word like this is "outrage," which often has a self-righteous component to it, much to everyone's detriment.

Genuine kindness can be fierce or even violent. Almost nothing is off-limits. It may look nothing like "kindness" from the outside, but on the inside you always know — and subconsciously, so does everyone else. Your judgement then carries the weight of authenticity, which their minds cannot use as an excuse for more self-deception. It is as though their darkness can no longer get the "grip" it needs to justify itself. It is instead confronted by a blinding Light, which is the one thing that it cannot withstand. It's not even something that you are _doing_, per se; it is simply what remains in the mind once self-deception — darkness — has vanished. Not just for you or the "good people," but for everyone.

Make no mistake: it would be foolish to pretend that evil doesn't exist. It surely does in some sense. In fact, from a certain perspective, it appears sentient; almost intelligent. It is that devil on your shoulder — but unlike in the cartoons, it doesn't just whisper obviously-bad ideas in your ear; no, it alters your very perception such that evil appears unmistakably _righteous._ You and I may be enemies, but our devils are secretly allied; yours triggering mine, which triggers yours back, etc., leading to that all-too-familiar descent into Hell. In fact, if you look carefully, you will see that our devils aren't truly separate: they behave more like a _single distributed malevolent entity_: the _Devil_, if you will.

It is that "evil global conspiracy" that some people fear exists: a covert entity responsible for all the world's ills, that hides itself so perfectly that nobody ever suspects its existence, let alone that they themselves are in on it. They cannot even see it when it is clearly and explicitly pointed out. It is _that_ good. It is the _primordial_ evil conspiracy; the one to which all the rest ultimately filter up, and to which they owe their existence. Every act of unkindness we've ever perpetrated on anyone; all the hardness we carry in our hearts; has only ever been in its service.

It continually drives humanity toward various kinds of Armageddon: situations in which everyone is violently proving how _righteous_ they are. It is why the US is headed toward civil war without anyone suspecting their own complicity, and explains bitter [divorces](https://www.gottman.com/blog/this-one-thing-is-the-biggest-predictor-of-divorce/) in which each side feels like the exclusive victim / hero. Nearly the whole world is caught in its terrible sway, evil provoking "righteous" retribution at every turn, without anyone ever noticing the true source of it all.

It is said that the elites are playing us off each other to take attention off of them, but the Devil is playing a _much_ bigger game — one in which even the elites are merely pawns. It tricks you into hating them specifically so that you will empower it — and thereby empower _them_. It tells you that your compassion isn't powerful enough to combat them — and it accomplishes this by convincing you that compassion is something soft and weak. It is a dark lie. Compassion is the most powerful force there is: it is the _only_ thing capable of genuinely dispelling evil, instead of perpetuating it in secret ways.

Your enemy is never truly other people, but the darkness that has ensnared all of our minds. It is not _intrinsic_ to any mind: that is a sinister illusion that the "Devil" uses to get you to do its dark bidding. Ultimately, MLK indeed said it best:

> *Darkness cannot drive out darkness, only light can do that. Hate cannot drive out hate, only love can do that.*

His words are wiser than we know, even all these years later. May we learn to recognize the profound truth therein — for all of our sakes.

> *Nail on the head brother. My most recent mushroom trip (also the largest dose I've ever taken) I became fixated on a news story I had heard that week. About an 8 year old girl from a tribe in the Amazon, who was tied to a tree and burned alive in order to scare her people off their land so it could be logged. I realized that at the moment he did it, whoever lit that gasoline actually felt / thought more or less okay about what he was doing. **And my mind was illuminated with dozens of the parallels between that man's malformed, horrific perceptual / behavioral state, and mine. I saw the same mistakes in value attribution, the same willful ignorance of the consequences of my acts and words. And there was nothing I could do to deny the similarity.***
