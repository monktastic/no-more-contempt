We each have our own ideas about "what's wrong with the world," and who is responsible. When we think about them, we tend to feel contempt. It seems like a healthy way to affirm our values, convey our disapproval, and deter others from similar misbehavior — in other words, it helps us "fight evil" and save the world.

But what if it is a trap?

Contempt[^contempt] actually has a sinister origin, and produces far-ranging toxic effects that are not only invisible to us, but carefully _hidden_ from us by our own minds. It fosters the very conditions in which the problems we decry are all but inevitable. At the micro level, it results in bitter divorces in which each side feels like the exclusive victim / hero; and at the macro level, it explains why the US is headed toward civil war despite nobody recognizing their own complicity. On an even greater scale, it explains that archetypal "evil global conspiracy" that captures our imagination.

It is imperative that we discover this trick by which our mind hides the true source and effects of our behavior — not only for our own sake, but the world's. When it is fully unveiled, the problems of the world — and their solutions — begin to look radically different.

_tl;dr: The purpose of contempt is to bait people into behavior that licenses even more contempt. We do this to reassure ourselves that evil doesn't exist in our own minds, but only other people's. The result is a world in which "evil forces" seemingly conspire against us, and we never suspect the truth: that we've always been in on the conspiracy. The central tools we use to fight it — contempt, malice, etc. — are precisely what empower it._

> _If only it were all so simple! If only there were evil people somewhere insidiously committing evil deeds, and it were necessary only to separate them from the rest of us and destroy them. But the line dividing good and evil cuts through the heart of every human being._ —Alexander Solzhenitsyn

Imagine giving someone a dehumanizing stare. It's hard to do, isn't it? It feels evil — because it is. Now imagine that this someone is a "bad person." The worse they are, the more righteous it will feel. Yet it will never look any less evil to them — _because it's not._ And unless they are a saint (which they're not), this will only make them feel _more_ justified in whatever storyline is fueling their misbehavior — because they can now plausibly claim that they are opposing evil.  You will in turn take this as confirmation that _they_ really are evil and ramp up your dehumanization.

The world will now rapidly become darker, in an all-too-familiar downward spiral. But the big shock is discovering that this was all orchestrated by a dark aspect within _both_ of your minds: yours baited theirs, and vice versa. This didn't even require physical violence; it could all be done subconsciously, through the eyes and tone of voice.

> _And no wonder, for even Satan masquerades as an angel of light._ —2 Corinthians 11:14

You know the classic image of the angel and devil sitting on our shoulders? It's _almost_ accurate, except for two things. First, the angel isn't really external to you, but represents the deepest aspect of your mind; your profound love for the world. In a deep sense, it *is* you. The devil is external; a kind of parasite[^intrinsic]. But it doesn't just whisper obviously-bad ideas in your ear; it pretends to *be* you, and alters your very perception so that certain evils appear unerringly righteous. The more successful it is, the less you will believe that you even have one — at least, in the same way that "bad people" do.

One of its tricks is to make some people appear subhuman, so that harming them feels okay[^subhuman]. Your morals (and social norms) act as a kind of buffer, preventing you from seeing most people this way. But it's always on the hunt for victims, and it only needs the slightest provocation to begin its manipulation.

> _Be kind, for everyone you meet is fighting a great battle._ —Author unknown

It searches for people whose misbehavior can't be chalked up to any kind of "great battle." Your angel knows that if you look deeply enough, you will _always_ find a kind of battle — and that this will prevent you from hating them, even if you must fight them. So your devil does something clever: it makes you perceive their devil as _intrinsic_ to their minds. You will then see them as _fundamentally bad_ or _defective_ — and therefore subhuman.

This is the wedge it uses to prevent your angel from getting an empathetic grip. This triggers behavior that will cause you both to rapidly accelerate away from any possibility of mutual humanizing. Both your devil and theirs and theirs _knew_ this would happen, because they are fundamentally identical. In fact, not only are they identical, but in a certain sense they behave more like puppets of a single shared Devil that is pulling _all_ of our strings.

This is not just a religious invention: it seems that everyone who introspects carefully enough eventually perceives this "distributed malevolent entity" with a seeming intelligence and volition of its own that, even if not _literally_ true, explain its apparently-coordinated behavior terrifyingly well. Your interaction isn't limited to the two of you: it ripples out from each of you into your lives, eventually reaching the far corners of the world.

<p align="center" width="100%">

</p>

It is that primordial "evil global conspiracy;" the one to which all the rest ultimately owe their existence. Every attempt to maliciously subdue it "out there" just strengthens it, because such behavior is only ever initiated _by_ it — though it makes us believe it was our (righteous) idea. Contempt is a form of self-deception, and like all others, it secretly invites more self-deception in others. It opens up that shadowy space of mind in which evil can be "safely" committed. This ripples out to the far corners of the globe, where we can plausibly deny any connection to it.

To be clear: there may well be groups of particularly "bad" people who conspire to cause great harm, but their existence wouldn't be possible if the rest of us weren't feeding the source — and conversely, it is _inevitable_ given that we are. **We must hold such people accountable** — but when we do this with contempt, we are reinforcing the conditions that effectively _compel_ their existence.

Our true enemy is not other people, but the parasite manipulating _all_ of our minds. The greatest gift you can give the world is healing yourself of it. This returns you to your "angel"; the only thing that can truly evict anyone's "devil." This "angel" is not weak, and it's not always nice. It can do whatever is required to defeat evil. The only thing it never does is lead you into that illusion from which you _pretend_ to be doing good while secretly causing mayhem.

_Any_ time you feel malice, contempt, or even self-righteousness toward another being; any time you see them as fundamentally defective or inferior; you are being manipulated into spreading evil in some way that you can't yet see. It is only by clearing up this misperception in your own mind that you begin to see what is causing it in others' — and thereby become able to do anything genuinely useful about it.

This is called compassion[^compassion]. It doesn't always know what the most beneficial behavior is. That requires _wisdom_. It only ensures that you are, indeed, behaving in a way that is aligned with your deepest values; your profound love for the world. Developing wisdom is a vast topic, and beyond the scope of this work.

When compassion is developed to its full extent, it reveals the vast interconnectedness not only of humanity, but of all of reality. From here, malice and contempt are literally impossible. This is something that is only fully seen upon enlightenment — but [we can all sense it](unity.md) to a greater or lesser degree at all times. 

Enlightenment is a lofty goal, but we can start small, by changing social norms. We can teach our children (and remind our allies) that contempt for "bad people" isn't at all what it seems to be. It must go the way of all other forms of evil if we are to defeat our true enemy.

## Footnotes

[^contempt]: Specifically, it is contempt for *people* that is wrong. Contempt for ideas or behaviors can actually be healthy.

[^intrinsic]: You may wonder how it is possible to know that evil is not intrinsic to other people's minds, but for our purposes it's more important to see that (1) our _perception_ of their intrinsic defectiveness is our own projection, and (2) our own darkness gives us the capacity to devolve into a condition in which others would be utterly convinced that _ours_ is intrinsic.

[^subhuman]: Notice that genocides can only be perpetrated when the victims are seen as subhuman. The Nazis referred to Jews as 'vermin,' and during the genocide in Rwanda, Tutsis were referred to as 'cockroaches.' This is a common pattern throughout history.

[^compassion]: You could say that everything comes down to distinguishing when we're being malicious in the name of good vs compassionate in a way that necessitates harm. People can sense the difference, even when we think they can't.
