Why is it so hard to maintain our humanity in the face of evil? And why are we "supposed to" in the first place?

---

All misbehavior — from cutting in line to genuine atrocities — is ultimately enabled by a kind of parasite in the mind. Think of it as that devil on our shoulders. It doesn't just whisper obviously-evil ideas in our ears; no, it alters our very perception, so that it appears okay (or even _righteous_) to step on certain people. It shields us from confronting the full implications of our words and behaviors.

The "bad people" know perfectly well when what they are doing is wrong, but that knowledge is very cleverly hidden from conscious self-reflection. If you try to viciously force them to confront it, it just drives the parasite deeper into their minds. But something in you already knows this.

When _you_ are in a state of self-deception — and we've all been there — you do not tolerate contempt from others. It makes you see them as _bad people_ who need to be put in _their_ place. It helps justify your self-deception — and makes you respond in a way that helps them justify theirs. This isn't an accident.

Our parasites are _collaborating_ — and contempt is the secret tool they use to communicate, beneath our conscious thresholds. Our contempt telegraphs to others that our mind is in that dark space, subconsciously plotting to elevate or otherwise enrich ourselves at the world's expense — and it invites them to do the same, whether they are nominally friends or enemies.

We treat the "bad people" with contempt to help ourselves feel superior; to further distance ourselves and prove that we're nothing alike. Unfortunately, it is the surest sign that we _are._ We are shoving people deeper into the abyss and calling it "righteous." Rather than admit it, our minds hide this horrible truth by doubling down on our self-deception, so that we never suspect it.

We maintain a dividing line between the "fundamentally" good and bad; those who deserve our compassion and those who deserve our contempt. That boundary sometimes grows, as when we first discover that "hurt people hurt people." But the maintenance of _any division at all_ indicates that our "devil" still has its foot in the door. The line exists only to justify its continued presence.

If you look carefully enough, you will discover that our devils together behave more like a single malevolent distributed entity — the _Devil_, if you will. It is that archetypal "evil conspiracy" that we subconsciously fear exists — the one to which all the rest ultimately owe their existence, and to which they all ultimately report — _and every one of us is secretly in on it_. It remains hidden by keeping our attention fixated perpetually outward, blinding us to our own complicity.

Every time we feel malice, contempt, or self-righteousness; any time we are unkind to anyone for any reason, we are secretly feeding the Beast. Every act of unkindness ripples through its terrible body, lowering the threshold for more acts of evil to erupt in faraway locations — for which we will feel absolutely no complicity. But part of us always knows. This is what we must make conscious.

To be clear: there are surely groups of particularly "endarkened" people who consciously conspire to cause great harm, and **we must hold such people accountable**. But when it is motivated by contempt, we are reinforcing the very conditions that effectively _compel_ their existence — and a deep part of us knows this. It is as though the left hand does not know what the right is doing.

Nobody ultimately _wants_ to be under the sway of their devil — the key word being "ultimately." There are certainly people who willingly harbor it; those whom we classically think of as "evil." It would be foolish to be "kind" to them in the _conventional_ sense. Yet it is far _more_ foolish to feel malice, because that is **exactly** what their demon wants — and it is also where it is hardest to detect our own self-deception, and the easiest to justify it to others. It is the ultimate trap.

The more you unearth your own demon, the more clearly you see that such people are suffering from a kind of Stockholm syndrome — and the more obvious it becomes that  driving them toward their captor is malevolent. You are smothering what little light is left. It is literally the _worst_ time to be unkind. Unconventional means may be necessary to deal with them, but unkindness never is. If you believe that they _have_ no light, consider that this may be exactly the "trap" I described.

**True kindness is not about being _nice._** It can be fierce or even [violent](https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/dalai-gun/) if necessary. It is only about being lucidly aware of your own capacity to fall into self-deception, and refusing to do so. It is about staying connected to your Heart; that part of you that remembers the Truth — the very thing that your parasite is trying to make you forget. **Your fight is with the parasite. Hating the host just strengthens it.** Only your Light can bring about the better world you most deeply desire. The more you remember this, the more your very being helps others remember.

Your true nemesis is never other people, despite obvious appearances to the contrary. It is the darkness that has ensnared all of our minds. The more we come to recognize just how badly it has fooled _us_, the more we appreciate what the "bad people" are up against, and the more we can be of genuine service in dispelling it. We each have a role to play, and it always begins with us.

It has torn my heart open on many occasions and revealed to me how my actions effect other people in ways I would've never imagined. In addition (and to the point), **psilocybin has increased my ability to empathize with people to a degree I never thought possible**.*

> *Nail on the head brother. My most recent mushroom trip (also the largest dose I've ever taken) I became fixated on a news story I had heard that week. About an 8 year old girl from a tribe in the Amazon, who was [tied to a tree and burned alive](https://www.survivalinternational.org/news/8033) in order to scare her people off their land so it could be logged. I realized that at the moment he did it, whoever lit that gasoline actually felt / thought more or less okay about what he was doing. **And my mind was illuminated with dozens of the parallels between that man's malformed, horrific perceptual / behavioral state, and mine. I saw the same mistakes in value attribution, the same willful ignorance of the consequences of my acts and words. And there was nothing I could do to deny the similarity.***
