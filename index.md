Evil is a kind of mind virus, and the way it works is exceptionally clever. It shields us from perceiving the harmful and self-serving aspects of our own behaviors while powerfully sensitizing us to those of others. This makes us want to viciously attack them, convinced that this will subdue their evil. But if we look, we'll see that such behavior is actually our own parasite telegraphing its existence to them in order to _provoke_ theirs, which we can then blame on them. The truth is that they are perceiving genuine darkness in us — the very thing that we are contemptuously judging them for — but we cannot admit this, because then we would have no leg to stand on. Indeed, the whole purpose of contempt is to drive the parasite so deeply into their minds that we can convince ourselves that it is not merely a parasite, but actually _intrinsic_ to their minds; that they are _fundamentally_ defective, therefore justifying our contempt. This makes it easier to overlook the self-serving aspects of our own actions and agendas.

This is what the virus wants: to make us each perceive the world so darkly what we overlook its presence in our own minds. It is why we sometimes suspect the existence of an "evil global conspiracy." Our parasites aren't actually fighting each other; instead, they together behave like a singular _distributed malevolent entity_, manipulating all of humanity from beneath our conscious thresholds. The Christians know it as the Devil, and the Buddhists call it the ego. You can treat it as a metaphor, but it is also as real as anything you can touch. It is the _primordial_ evil conspiracy; the one to which all the rest owe their existence, and to which they ultimately filter up. Every act of unkindness we have ever perpetrated on _anyone_ has secretly been in its service — and part of us has always known this. But this knowledge rarely reaches conscious awareness. It exists in a kind of semi-conscious limbo state, but we _can_ learn to become fully conscious of it. When we do, something astonishing happens.

When the darkness lifts, it feels exactly like being freed of a demonic possession. Underneath it is what you most essentially are: a Light so vast it defies description. You see that you never truly wanted to hurt anyone; never _could_ want such a thing — nor, surprisingly, could anybody else. It was only profound confusion that allows us to. In truth, you ultimately _are_ everyone and everything else, just pretending that you're not. One consciousness, looking out through countless eyes.  There are many ways to say this, all of which sound absurd to the rational mind, but the deepest part of you knows it to be true. When you fully unveil the Light in yourself, you automatically see it in everyone else — including those who normally seem not to have any. This is what the darkness is trying to hide. Everything we do to each other — or to Mother Nature — ultimately comes back to us, one way or another. This is what humanity is slowly waking up to. But make no mistake: it is not all rainbows and sunshine.

You discover that you could _always_ perceive the Light in others — and thus you knew perfectly well that you were only shoving the "bad people" deeper _into_ the abyss; smothering the barely-audible cries of their inner Light under the guise of good. You knew you could get away with it, because everyone else was pretending not to know, either, in a kind of unspoken social contract. _Of course_ cruelty and contempt are how we deal with evil! How could that ever create more? But there were always those with the eyes to see. They knew what you were doing — and yet, sinister as it was, they never gave up on you, seeing you for who you really were. This may have sometimes required tough love, but it was love nonetheless. It is only thanks to their profound grace that you've found your way out of the bewildering maze. Yet they do not take credit for it, for this grace utterly transcends personal achievement. You are brought to your knees with tears of immense gratitude. The Light is real after all.

But you now stand face-to-face with all the harm you've ever perpetrated on the world since time immemorial, and it is far more than you could hope to clean up in a single lifetime. Seeing this hurts more than you can fathom. How widely and quickly it spread! How many it affected! The darkness exploited your fear and pride, enabling you to do things you otherwise couldn't have, if only you had seen what was really happening. But you looked away from your Light, thereby losing contact with your _absolute_ goodness. This made you go out seeking for it _relatively_ — that is, at the expense of others. The need to be seen as _good_ tricked you into making other people bad. Such an innocent mistake, yet it is still your responsibility to clean it up. Your only atonement is to firmly commit to holding the Light for others, even when — indeed, _especially_ when — they cannot hold it for themselves. Far from being a burden, you discover that this has always been your true purpose; your deepest calling.

This is called compassion, and it has nothing to do with being nice. True compassion can be fierce, or even violent, as the situation warrants. Its only defining characteristic is that it is utterly free of self-deception. It does not perceive evil as intrinsic to any mind, and this seemingly-subtle change makes all the difference. It surgically targets the parasite itself, instead of the confused being who unwittingly harbors it. The profound integrity of this act prevents their darkness from finding the "hook" in your mind that it would normally use to justify itself. Whereas before, your darkness was secretly conspiring with theirs to strengthen its grip on both of you, now your Light is conspiring with theirs to evict it. This is a bewildering experience for them. They may still consciously perceive you as an enemy, but under the covers, something quite different is happening. The parasite's grip is being weakened. This may be nowhere near as darkly satisfying as viciously attacking them, but it is infinitely more valuable.

To be clear: it does no good to pretend that you can see the Light in others when you cannot. This can backfire miserably, as it rapidly degrades into merely being _nice._ Thus, both pretending to see the good in others and overlooking it are harmful. The _only_ solution is to learn to actually see it, and the only way to do that is to fully uncover your own. There are countless methods for doing so, encoded both in ancient spiritual traditions and more modern techniques; ranging from meditation to psychedelics to shadow work and more. 

It is also astonishingly easy to lie to ourselves about whether we are actually wielding fierce compassion or merely pretending to. If there is even a _trace_ of malice, genuine contempt, or self-righteousness, it is always the darkness masquerading as the Light. In fact, the simplest measure of how much we are still hiding from ourselves is how much we can still muster these sentiments for our enemies; the "bad people." As long as we still harbor them, we are always liable to slide down the dark path that has enabled all the atrocities there ever were. All that is required is the right — or wrong — confluence of circumstances. It happens faster than you can imagine. You _do not_ want to find yourself there. You _will_ have to confront it, sooner or later.

There are vast and subtle networks of causality that we are normally unconscious of, and that secretly drive the fate of the world. If we pay attention only to the surface activity, we are missing out on the bulk of what actually shapes our reality. Evil can look sweet and pretty, while kindness is sometimes violent. It is impossible to know which is which — and easy to convince ourselves otherwise — until we have done the deep inner work that melts the core confusion. So much of human activity is subtly (or grossly) self-deceptive — and any time any one of us engages in it, we induce the same tendency in others, be they friend or foe. Our true allies are not those who push the same agendas we do, nor are our enemies necessarily those who oppose us. At the ultimate level, something much more profound is going on. To divide the world into the fundamentally good and bad is to miss the point. Your true enemy lies within, and the more you defeat it "in here," the more it vanishes "out there." What lies underneath is a profound Love for all of reality; one that excludes nothing and forsakes no-one, including the targets of its fearsome wrath, should that be necessary. Forsaking others ultimately only forsakes ourselves.

I wish I could tell you that I have completed the journey myself, but I've only learned enough to see that I am still far from it. Yet we each catch glimpses from time to time, and it is our duty to carry those glimpses into the world as best we are able. I am still liable to mess things up while believing otherwise, and I hope you will hold my feet to the fire when I do. All I can do is promise to do the same for you.

May all beings be free from suffering and its causes. Amen.
