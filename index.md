> _For so long as the root of wickedness is hidden, it is strong. But when it is recognized, it is dissolved. When it is revealed, it perishes. ... It is powerful because we have not recognized it._ — The Gospel of Philip

Why is it so hard to maintain our humanity in the face of evil? And why are we "supposed to" in the first place?

---

All misbehavior — from cutting in line to genuine atrocities — is ultimately enabled by a kind of parasite in the mind. Think of it as that devil on our shoulders. But it doesn't just whisper obviously-evil ideas in our ears; no, it alters our very perception, so that it appears okay — or even _righteous_ — to step on certain people. It shields us from confronting the full implications of our words and behaviors.

The "bad people" know perfectly well when what they are doing is wrong, but that knowledge is very cleverly hidden from conscious self-reflection. If you try to viciously force them to confront it, it just drives the parasite deeper into their minds. But something in you already knows this.

When _you_ are in a state of self-deception — and we've all been there — you do not tolerate contempt from others. It makes you see them as _bad people_ who need to be put in _their_ place. It helps justify your self-deception — and encourages you to respond in a way that helps them justify theirs. This isn't an accident.

If you introspect deeply enough into your mind — and this can be hard — you will discover that something in you is _eager_ to shove "bad people"'s mind deeper into the abyss. You can subconsciously perceive that they are in the grip of a terrible demon that we ourselves share — indeed, that is controlling our mind _at this very moment_ — and the similarity horrifies you. The further you can push them into its grip, the more they will appear to be _fundamentally defective_, and thus unlike you.

This actually creates _new_ evil, but it doesn't feel like that. It feels like we are zeroing in on existing evil; exposing or distilling the hidden evil that is already there. It is as though we have finally caught a hold of the source of darkness in the world, and we can finally _punish_ it.

> _And no wonder, for even Satan masquerades as an angel of light. So it is not strange that his ministers also masquerade as ministers of righteousness._ —2 Corinthians 11:14-16
 
This is a smokescreen created by your devil. It knows perfectly well that this will bring more darkness. In fact, that is its whole game. But it must never let you know this, and so it hides this behind _astonishingly_ seductive justifications that you don't even realize are seductions. All you consciously feel is "I'm fighting evil," and you have all the evidence to prove it.

Under the covers, their devil reached out to yours to offer it a secret handshake — and contempt was sign of your acceptance. No matter how well we try to mask this, people can subconsciously sense it. It invites everyone — ally and enemy alike — into that dark space of mind with us. What goes on in there isn't pretty.

If you look carefully enough, you will discover that our devils together behave more like a single malevolent distributed entity — the _Devil_, if you will. It is that archetypal "evil conspiracy" that we subconsciously fear exists — the one to which all the rest ultimately owe their existence, and to which they all ultimately report — _and every one of us is secretly in on it_. It remains hidden by keeping our attention fixated perpetually outward, blinding us to our own participation.

Every time we feel malice, contempt, or self-righteousness; any time we are unkind to anyone for any reason, we are secretly feeding the Beast. Every act of unkindness ripples through its terrible body, lowering the threshold for more acts of evil to erupt in faraway locations — for which we will feel absolutely no complicity. But part of us always knows.

To be clear, we're certainly not all equally complicit. There are surely groups of particularly "endarkened" people who consciously conspire to cause great harm, and **we must hold such people accountable**. But when we do so with contempt, we are reinforcing the very conditions that effectively _compel_ their existence — and a deep part of us knows this.

So far I have been calling this all "subconscious," but that's not entirely accurate. The greatest shock is discovering that it was somehow _always_ accessible to consciousness, if we'd just bothered to look. This isn't a judgement of us. We really _want_ to look, but something is stopping us. Our job is to discover whatever that is.

Nobody ultimately _wants_ to be under the sway of their devil — the key word being "ultimately." There are certainly people who willingly harbor it; those whom we classically think of as "evil." It would be foolish to be "kind" to them in the _conventional_ sense. Yet it is far _more_ foolish to feel malice, because that is **exactly** what their demon wants — and it is also where it is hardest to detect our own self-deception, and the easiest to justify it to others. It is the ultimate trap.

The more you unearth your own demon, the more clearly you see that such people are suffering from a kind of Stockholm syndrome — and the more obvious it becomes that  driving them toward their captor is malevolent. You are smothering what little light is left. (If you believe that they _have_ no light, consider that this may be exactly the "trap" I just described.) It is literally the _worst_ time to be unkind. Unconventional means may be necessary to deal with them, but unkindness never is. This could only be true if "kindness" does not mean what we usually think.

**True kindness is not about being _nice._** It can be fierce or even [violent](https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/dalai-gun/) if necessary. It only requires being lucidly aware of your own capacity for self-deception, and refusing to fall into it. It is about staying connected to your Heart; that part of you that remembers the Truth — the very thing that your parasite is lulling you into forgetting. **Your fight is with the parasite. Hating the host just strengthens it.** 

Only your Light can bring about the better world you most deeply desire. The more you remember this, the more your very way of being helps others remember.

Our true nemesis is never other people, despite obvious appearances to the contrary. It is the darkness that has ensnared all of our minds. The more we come to recognize just how badly it has fooled _us_, the more we appreciate what the "bad people" are up against, and the more we can be of genuine service in dispelling it. We each have a role to play, and it always begins with us.

About an 8 year old girl from a tribe in the Amazon, who was [tied to a tree and burned alive](https://www.survivalinternational.org/news/8033) in order to scare her people off their land so it could be logged. I realized that at the moment he did it, whoever lit that gasoline actually felt / thought more or less okay about what he was doing. **And my mind was illuminated with dozens of the parallels between that man's malformed, horrific perceptual / behavioral state, and mine. I saw the same mistakes in value attribution, the same willful ignorance of the consequences of my acts and words. And there was nothing I could do to deny the similarity.***

This allows us to feel superior, in a way that can plausibly be defended as righteous. We are only _fighting evil,_ after all.

We maintain a dividing line between the "fundamentally" good and bad; those who deserve our compassion and those who deserve our contempt. That boundary changes throughout life, as we develop increasing empathy. But the maintenance of _any division at all_ indicates that our "devil" still has its foot in the door. The line exists only to justify its continued presence.

The short answer to "why show evildoers compassion?" is that the only alternative is to be evil.
