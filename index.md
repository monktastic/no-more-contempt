_[Warning: This piece deals with issues around the nature of evil. It is **not** light reading.]_

When wise people urge compassion for evildoers, they're not suggesting that we be _nice_. They're warning us about an insidious trap that the whole world is presently caught in.

Consider [this horrifying story from 2012](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/southamerica/brazil/9005835/Loggers-burned-Amazon-tribe-girl-alive.html):

> _Loggers in Brazil captured an eight-year-old girl from one of the Amazon's last uncontacted tribes and burned her alive as part of a campaign to force the indigenous population from its land [...]_

Reading this would make any sane person profoundly angry and heartbroken for the girl, her tribe, and humanity. It makes us want to do everything in our power to ensure this kind of thing never happens again — which may require punishing or even harming the perpetrators. At the same time, we may feel a desire to harm them quite independently of any good it will bring: pure old-fashioned vengeance.

These two motivations — compassion and malice — arise from very different aspects of mind. But they can be extremely difficult to tell apart — particularly because we often dress up the latter to make it seem respectable; as though it is "for the greater good." We tell ourselves that it doesn't matter which intention is driving our behavior, because only the _result_ is important.

_This confusion is how evil sneaks into the world, undetected._

People are _exquisitely_ sensitive to our motivations, and malice makes us look evil — because it _is_ (as we shall see). We may not even be aware of how it comes across, but others are (if only subconsciously), and it powerfully evokes _their_ malice. Our allies join in the frenzy, while our enemies feel compelled to fight _our_ evil in return. Even if it scares them into changing their behavior (in public, anyway), the darkness has been embedded deeper into their minds, and _will_ manifest in some way — though perhaps far enough away in time and space that we can disown all complicity.

The world becomes darker as a result. This isn't an unfortunate side effect of our well-intentioned behavior: the whole thing was secretly orchestrated by a sinister aspect within our minds. The way this works is _insanely_ clever.

People are only able to misbehave due to a kind of self-deception: part of them knows perfectly well that what they're doing is wrong, but that "wrongness" is cleverly hidden from conscious self-reflection. Part of us knows this, and that our malice will only deepen their self-deception, thus enabling more evil. But we hide this knowledge from ourselves and forge ahead anyway, telling ourselves that our behavior is righteous. _This is self-deception_ — and it makes them perceive us as evil for precisely the same reason that we did them, leading to a downward spiral into Hell.

It's not the _harm itself_ that triggered this spiral, but the malice with which we did it. Harming them out of fierce compassion may still provoke some form of retaliation, but the profoundly benevolent intent prevents their self-deception mechanism from finding the "hook" it needs to reinforce itself.

If it is really this simple, then why aren't we already doing it?

Part of us _knows_ that we're not intrinsically better than anyone, but we hide this from ourselves. We use malice to keep the "bad people" trapped in delusion, so that we can prove ourselves morally superior. Unfortunately, baiting people into evil is hardly "morally superior," and so we must hide this, too, in a tightening noose of deception. It collapses in on itself like a black hole, preventing us from ever suspecting our dark motives.

Let's look at this from another angle.

> _And no wonder, for even Satan masquerades as an angel of light._ —2 Corinthians 11:14

You know the classic image of the angel and devil sitting on our shoulders? It's _almost_ accurate, except for two things. First, the angel isn't really external to you, but represents your true nature as compassion. In a deep sense, it *is* you. The devil is external; a kind of parasite[^intrinsic]. But it doesn't just whisper obviously-bad ideas in your ear; it pretends to be your inner angel, and alters your very perception so that evil appears righteous.

<p align="center" width="100%">

> _Be kind, for everyone you meet is fighting a great battle._ —Author unknown

Your self-image prevents you from being cruel to just anyone, so your devil does something very clever: it searches for people whose "battle" is hard for you to see, and makes their devil appear _intrinsic_. This way, they appear _fundamentally morally defective,_ and thus worthy of malice.

Long before it can justify outright cruelty, our devil finds people who we can treat with at least a little bit of contempt. The game is the same: use it to prod people into becoming increasingly worse, until we _can_ justify cruelty.

We don't have enough power to accomplish much alone — but luckily, our devils are coordinating: mine baits yours into baiting mine ... Enemies trigger each other, and "allies" embolden each other, but secretly _everyone_ doing this is allied in evil. In fact, if you look closely, our devils behave more like outgrowths of a single _shared_ Devil that is continually manipulating _all_ of our minds.

It is not just a religious invention: I think that everyone who introspects carefully enough eventually perceives this "distributed malevolent entity" which has a kind of intelligence and volition of its own that, even if not _literally_ true, explain its seemingly-coordinated behavior terrifyingly well.

It continually drives us toward various kinds of Armageddon: situations in which everyone is violently proving just how righteous they are. This is why the US is headed toward civil war without anyone recognizing their own complicity, and it explains bitter divorces in which each side feels like the exclusive victim / hero.

<p align="center" width="100%">
    <img width="300px" src="img/shared-devil.png"> 
</p>

It is that primordial "evil global conspiracy," to which all the rest ultimately owe their existence — and _we_ are its unwitting minions. Every attempt to maliciously subdue it "out there" just strengthens it, because such behavior is only ever initiated _by_ it, even though it makes us believe that it was initiated by us. 

**Any** time you feel malice, hatred, contempt, or even self-righteousness toward another being; any time you see them as fundamentally defective or inferior; any time you are tempted to divide the world into the (fundamentally) "good" and "bad," you are being manipulated into feeding the Beast. People are certainly trapped by darkness to varying degrees, but it is never intrinsic.

<p align="center" width="100%">
    <img width="300px" src="img/good-vs-bad.png"> 
</p>

To be clear: there may well be groups of particularly "bad" people who conspire to cause great harm, but their existence wouldn't be possible if the rest of us weren't feeding the source — and conversely, it is _inevitable_ given that we are. **We must hold such people accountable**, but when we do this with contempt, we are reinforcing the conditions that effectively _compel_ their existence.

Our true enemy is not other people, but the dark "entity" that has captured _all_ of our minds. By keeping our attention fixated perpetually outward, it ensures that we never introspect deeply enough to discover how it works, and thereby discover how to end it. The Buddhists call it the ego: the collection of habits we use to misperceive ourselves as separate and special.

> *The shadow is a moral problem that challenges the whole ego-personality, for no one can become conscious of the shadow without considerable moral effort. To become conscious of it involves recognizing the dark aspects of the personality as present and real. This act is the essential condition for any kind of self-knowledge.* —Carl Jung

The only way out of this trap is to see beyond the ego, to your fundamentally compassionate nature. When you see this, you cannot help but see it in everyone else, too — because in an astonishing sense, [they _are_ you](unity.md). From here, you cannot possibly harbor malice or contempt. This frees you up to perceive the hidden causes of their self-deception, enabling you to do something real about it. This is not fully developed until enlightenment, but we all can taste it at all times.

Compassion doesn't mean being _nice_. It can outwardly be as fierce (or violent[^dalai-lama-gun], or even _apparently_ contemptuous) as the situation warrants, but these behaviors come from a completely different source. People can sense your motivation even when you think they can't — in fact, even when _you_ (consciously) can't — and it makes all the difference in the world.

_This_ is why wise people urge compassion for evildoers: the only alternative is to be — and spread — evil (usually while convinced that it is righteous).

Compassion doesn't always know what the most beneficial behavior _is_. It merely ensures that you are behaving in a way that is aligned with your deepest values; your profound love for the world. Determining the most effective behavior requires _wisdom_, which is a vast topic, and beyond the scope of this work. There is no doubt that dealing with profound evil in the real world is _hard._

> *Such a man knows that whatever is wrong in the world is also in himself, and if he only learns to deal with his own shadow, he has done something real for the world. He has succeeded in shouldering at least an infinitesimal part of the gigantic, unsolved problems of our day.* —Carl Jung

Enlightenment may be a lofty goal, but we can start small, by changing social norms. We can teach our children that contempt for "bad people" isn't what it seems to be, and refuse to join our allies when we can sense that their motivation isn't "clean." Contempt[^contempt] must go the way of all other forms of evil if we are to defeat our true enemy.

## Footnotes

[^contempt]: Specifically, we mean (genuine) contempt for *people*. Contempt for ideas or behaviors can actually be healthy, as perhaps can (apparent) contempt that is rooted in genuine compassion.

[^intrinsic]: You may wonder how it is possible to know that evil is not intrinsic to other people's minds, but for our purposes it's more important to see that (1) our _perception_ of their intrinsic defectiveness is our own projection, and (2) our own darkness gives us the capacity to devolve into a condition in which others would be utterly convinced that _ours_ is intrinsic.

[^dalai-lama-gun]: The Dalai Lama was once asked what you should do if a gunman is trying to shoot you and you have a gun. [He said "shoot back."](https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/dalai-gun/)
