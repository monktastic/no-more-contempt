Why do wise people urge compassion for evildoers? Are they being naïve? Or could it be that they see something that we don't?

Every one of us has had the experience of skirting our conscience — behaving in a way that goes against our deepest values, but that we convince ourselves is okay anyway.

Maybe we've helped ourselves to "a little extra" at the expense of a company, convinced that we're only harming its wealthy (and greedy) owners. Maybe it turns out that the owners weren't so wealthy after all, or that our behavior harmed many other people indirectly. But our minds found an excuse for those too — or else blocked that knowledge entirely from conscious awareness, to preserve our self-image as the victims.

Or perhaps we were a little bit nasty to someone, convinced that they deserved it — having no deep insight into the true source of their misbehavior, and unable to admit that we just compounded their difficulties in life. We can't see that a tiny part of them was actually _trying_, and that our casual cruelty was the final straw that made them lose faith in humanity. To hide this, we must convince ourselves that _no_ part of them was trying; that they are _fundamentally morally defective,_ and thus beyond help. But it doesn't feel like we're _convincing_ ourselves; it simply feels like "the truth." It _must_ feel that way.

It is very painful to admit that we're doing this, but it gets worse. If you look carefully enough, you'll find that all the darkness in the world is intimately connected. Every act of unkindness we commit propagates into the Whole, lowering the threshold for darkness to manifest elsewhere. Every act of self-deception makes it more likely that genuine atrocities will be committed by someone, somewhere — atrocities for which we will not only feel absolutely no complicity, but which will actually trigger _self-righteous outrage_, thus inciting us to compound the problem.

This is the secret mechanism by which evil spreads without anyone realizing their part. Each one of us is only able to see the self-deception in others, provoking us to violently combat it, reinforcing it while certain that we are fighting it.

When you look into the eyes of a person and see "evil," what you are actually seeing is a place where all this dark activity has accumulated especially intensely — and a seductive invitation to pile on _more_, in a way that nobody would dare judge us for. Our culture's cumulative self-deception _necessitates_ the existence of such people — and secretly "benefits" from it, because they act as scapegoats to draw our attention away from all the ways in which we support them.

<p align="center" width="100%"> <img width="300px" src="img/evil-above-world.png"> </p>

You would think that the "bad people" are (or _should_ be) especially aware of their evil, but the only reason they can do it in the first place is because their self-deception is especially good at hiding it from conscious self-awareness — and our attempts to violently evict it are secretly attempts to _reinforce_ it in a way that neither we nor anyone else will ever suspect. This is why our political opponents dig in their heels when we mock and shame them: part of us _needs_ them to, so that we and they can continue to act as covers for each other's self-deception.

To be clear: our darkness can indeed suppress other people's misbehavior — at least, in public, and for a time. We can thus easily convince ourselves that it "worked" — but only because we choose not to look too closely at the full implications of our behavior.

> _And no wonder, for even Satan masquerades as an angel of light. So it is not strange that his ministers also masquerade as ministers of righteousness._ —2 Corinthians 11:14-16

From a certain perspective, this cumulative shadowy activity appears sentient; even intelligent. In fact, your darkness and mine aren't truly separate: they behave more like appendages of a _distributed malevolent entity_, manipulating all of humanity from within the dark crevices of our own minds; the places where we dare not look.

It is what some cultures know as the _Devil_ — and it is as "real" as anything you can touch. By keeping our attention perpetually fixated outward, it prevents us from looking too closely "in here" — the one place where we have direct power over it. Its greatest trick is to make you perceive other people's evil as being _intrinsic_ to their minds. **This is the moment of truth. By accepting this misperception, you are choosing to enter your own shadow.** Through repeated acceptance, others increasingly identify _your_ evil as intrinsic. It is an _insanely_ clever ploy — and it is working.

<p align="center" width="100%"><img width="300px" src="./img/shared-devil.png"></p>

In more modern terms, it is the _evil global conspiracy_ — that secret cabal responsible for all the world's ills, yet whose full membership remains forever elusive. It is the _primordial_ evil conspiracy; the one to which all the rest owe their existence, and to which they ultimately filter up. Every single conspiracy you can identify "out there" is rooted in this shared hidden aspect of mind. They feel "shadowy" because they are outer reflections of our collective unconscious. To believe that we have pinned it down externally is to have fallen into its most basic trap.

The elites may well be playing us off each other to take attention away from themselves — but the Devil is playing a _much_ bigger game; one in which even the elites are merely pawns. It controls our perception and models of reality so completely that we can hardly even fathom its existence. We feel that the dark state of our world must be due to individuals who are fundamentally unlike us, and whose violent elimination would bring peace. It is astonishing that we never notice where these dark thoughts actually originate from, and what master they secretly serve.

<p align="center" width="100%"><img width="300px" src="./img/parasite.png"></p>

It certainly feels like there are people who have _chosen_ the Darkness in a way that we have not — and in a way, this is true. But in every case, there is an aspect of their mind that doesn't yet know that they have done this — just as there is within ourselves. In a sense, the whole fight against evil comes down to _recruiting_ that part. Everything else just causes _more._

---

This is called _compassion_ or _kindness_ — **and it has nothing to do with being nice.**

It is simply about being free of self-deception, so that our attempts to fight evil do not have the "unintended" consequence of creating more. From here, contempt (for people) is impossible, because you clearly see the sense in which the Darkness is impersonal, despite people having _chosen_ it in some sense. Hating them for it is always a trap — and now you see why. This is hard to communicate, but we will try.

The secret purpose of contempt is to telegraph our own inner darkness to others, while convincing us that we're doing no such thing. This acts as a kind of "secret handshake" with their darkness, which in turn convinces their conscious minds that we aren't so innocent after all, thus alleviating any remaining compunction they might still have. But since we don't know that we're doing this, we take this as confirmation that _they_ are evil, which licenses escalation. Consciously, we act dismayed by their recalcitrance, but our darkness is secretly rejoicing in accomplishing its goal. 

All of this only works because part of us _knows_ that we're doing it, and part of them knows that we know, etc. — but at the same time, we both _don't_ know. This is also how _malice_ and _self-righteousness_ work. They are always tricks.

Our unwillingness to confront our own darkness is what perpetuates it in the world. Indeed, it is this very unwillingness that makes it "dark" in the first place. **Evil is ultimately nothing but _the willingness to look away_ — not just from the darkness "out there," but from the darkness "in here."**

But what is it that we're looking away _from_, exactly? To say that "evil is the willingness to look away from evil" would be circular.

There is a profound and astonishing sense in which we **are** everyone and everything. Realizing this in its entirety is known as _enlightenment_ (en-_Light_-enment), and is indeed a lofty goal — but all of us can sense it at all times, to one degree or another. It is why we thank other people even for acts of kindness that don't benefit us directly. We intuit that what happens to any part ultimately happens to the whole. **You are the Light** — and so is everyone else. This may sound mystical or "woo woo," but it can be known directly and concretely. All self-deception — and thus all evil — ultimately boils down to our inability (or unwillingness) to see this.

This is why contempt is intrinsically self-deceptive: it is the pretense that we are _fundamentally better_ than others, which the deepest part of us realizes is a sham — and which they can sense too, no matter how "evil" they are. It is the existence of this common knowledge (in the [technical sense](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/common-knowledge/): that _they know that we know that they know..._) that permits evil to spread in the way described above. So ironically, evil ultimately depends on our fundamental unity.

<p align="center" width="100%"><img width="300px" src="./img/good-vs-bad.png"></p>

It is still unfortunately common for people to gather and vibe over how we "get away with" things, but the key insight is that this is an illusion: we never "get away" with anything at all. Harming others always ultimately harms us; looking down on them is looking down on ourselves; and forsaking them is secretly a desire to forsake ourselves, because we're not ready to come Home yet. Until we see this, literally everything we do to "fight evil" secretly perpetuates it. It is only through compassion — freedom from self-deception — that we discover how to fight evil in a way that actually works.

**Such behavior need not look anything like "compassion" in the conventional sense.** It may require contempt for their _behaviors_ or _beliefs_.  It may be fierce or violent, perhaps even manifesting as mocking or shaming. But it arises from a very different source, and has a very different impact on all minds involved. Its profound integrity prevents the darkness in others from finding easy justification for itself. **This is the secret mechanism by which the _Light_ spreads.**

At its fiercest, the Light can look almost indistinguishable from darkness — _almost._ They can be hard to tell apart, but our subconscious always knows. It is this apparent difficulty that give our darkness cover to sneak in. But the most humbling discovery is that it was never difficult at all; never truly "subconscious": it was always perfectly accessible to consciousness, if only we had chosen to look. Again, _we chose not to look._ **We chose our agendas and ideologies over our kindness.** This was our fatal mistake.

This is a painful realization, but also the most liberating: all that is required to redeem ourselves is to _choose to look_. Doing this even once, we discover that we never truly _wanted_ to look away; that we never _could_ want such a thing — and that nobody else could either, if only they knew. This firm commitment to Look ripples throughout reality, tilling the ground for others to follow suit in their own time. This is the greatest gift we have to offer the world, and it doesn't require any special circumstances. Every moment is a fresh opportunity to re-establish our deepest integrity.

I wish I could leave you with some wisdom about real, practical ways to put this knowledge to use. Alas, such wisdom is the work of a lifetime, and I am a mere fledgling myself. All I know is that I wish to stop playing the confused game that we have inherited, and to remember what truly matters. I only hope that you will join me, whether we be "friends" or "foes" — and that you will hold my feet to the fire with unflinching compassion when I (pretend to) forget.

> *Nail on the head brother. My most recent mushroom trip (also the largest dose I've ever taken) I became fixated on a news story I had heard that week. About an 8 year old girl from a tribe in the Amazon, who was tied to a tree and burned alive in order to scare her people off their land so it could be logged. I realized that at the moment he did it, whoever lit that gasoline actually felt / thought more or less okay about what he was doing. **And my mind was illuminated with dozens of the parallels between that man's malformed, horrific perceptual / behavioral state, and mine. I saw the same mistakes in value attribution, the same willful ignorance of the consequences of my acts and words. And there was nothing I could do to deny the similarity.***
