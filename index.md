We each have our own ideas about "what's wrong with the world," and who is responsible. When we think about them, we tend to feel contempt. It seems like a healthy way to affirm our values, convey our disapproval, and deter others from similar misbehavior — in other words, to help us "fight evil" and save the world.

But what if it is a trap — an _insanely_ clever one?

> _If only it were all so simple! If only there were evil people somewhere insidiously committing evil deeds, and it were necessary only to separate them from the rest of us and destroy them. But the line dividing good and evil cuts through the heart of every human being. And who is willing to destroy a piece of his own heart?_ —Alexander Solzhenitsyn

We've all done something wrong while convincing ourselves that it's not. What we may not realize is that _all_ evil ultimately depends on this very mechanism of self-deception. We are motivated _not_ to see this, because that lets us believe that we are fundamentally different from the "bad people." We treat them with contempt to bait them into behaving in ways that confirm our moral superiority.

Unfortunately, part of us _knows_ that we're doing this, and baiting people into evil  is hardly "morally superior," so we carefully hide it from ourselves. This is *itself* an act of self-deception, and perhaps the hardest one to detect, because it feels so righteously motivated. Seeing how your mind hides this truth is key to understanding how the "bad people" do what _they_ do without feeling bad.

Once you see this, everything changes.

You discover that there is darkness within each of us. It is not intrinsic to our minds, but is more like a parasite. Our darkness knows that we will not harm just anyone, so it does something very clever: it alters our perception such that we _see_ the darkness as intrinsic to some people's minds; we see them as _fundamentally_ bad. This way, we can be malicious without compunction.

Consciously, we don't realize that we're being manipulated; it feels like we're expressing a natural and healthy instinct to violently attack evil — which we now mistakenly equate with attacking _people_. But no matter how subdued our attack (e.g., mockery), our underlying malicious intent makes us appear evil to them for exactly the same reason that they appear evil to us.

This has the effect of driving their darkness deeper into their minds, making it appear even _more_ surely intrinsic, which inspires even more righteous violence from us, resulting in an all-too-familiar downward spiral. But the real shock is discovering that this mutual descent into Hell is secretly being orchestrated by the darkness in _both_ of our minds.

Our darkness tricks us into behaving in ways that will convince others that ours is intrinsic, because it knows exactly how theirs will respond — _because ours and theirs are identical_. In fact, they are not just identical, but are more like outgrowths of a single shared "shadowy presence" that continually manipulates all of our minds; the _Devil_, if you will.

> _And no wonder, for even Satan masquerades as an angel of light. So it is not strange that his ministers also masquerade as ministers of righteousness._ —2 Corinthians 11:14

This is not just a religious invention: I think that everyone who introspects carefully enough eventually perceives this "distributed malevolent entity" which has a kind of intelligence and volition of its own that, even if not _literally_ true, explain its seemingly-coordinated behavior terrifyingly well. Our true enemy is not other people, but this dark "entity" that has captured our minds.

It is the primordial "evil global conspiracy," to which all the rest ultimately owe their existence. Every attempt to maliciously subdue it "out there" just strengthens it, because such behavior is only ever initiated _by_ it, even though it makes us believe that it was initiated by us. Contempt is its most insidious tool precisely because it appears to be the most unmistakably righteous. It is a secret way to leak evil deep into the world, where we can disown all complicity for it.

To be clear: there may well be groups of particularly "bad" people who conspire to cause great harm, but their existence wouldn't be possible if the rest of us weren't feeding the source — and conversely, it is _inevitable_ given that we are. **We must hold such people accountable**, but when we do this with contempt, we are reinforcing the conditions that effectively _compel_ their existence.

The only way for humanity to defeat the Devil is to stop falling for its tricks. Any time you feel malice, hatred, contempt, or even self-righteousness toward another being; any time you see them as fundamentally defective or inferior; you are being manipulated. As you begin to clear up this misperception in your own mind, you discover more of what is causing it in others', which is the only way to do anything genuinely useful about it.

> _Be kind, for everyone you meet is fighting a great battle._ —Author unknown

This is called compassion (or kindness), and it doesn't mean being _nice_. It can outwardly be as fierce (or violent, or _apparently_ contemptuous) as the situation warrants. It need not take any particular form, and cannot be reduced to principles, except for one: it never falls into the above misperception.

It doesn't always know what the most beneficial behavior _is_. That requires _wisdom_. Developing wisdom is a vast topic, and beyond the scope of this work. Compassion merely ensures that you are, indeed, behaving in a way that is aligned with your deepest values; your profound love for the world. People can subconsciously sense your motivation even when you think they can't — in fact, even when _you_ (consciously) can't — and it makes more difference than you can possibly know.

Compassion naturally stems from recognition of the vast interconnectedness of reality; perception of our fundamental unity. Seeing this in its entirety is _enlightenment._ But long before enlightenment, [we are all able to taste it](unity.md) to one degree or another.

Enlightenment is a lofty goal, but we can start small, by changing social norms. We can teach our children that contempt for "bad people" isn't what it seems to be, and refuse to support our allies when they engage in it. Contempt must go the way of all other forms of evil if we are to defeat our true enemy.
