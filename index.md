Evil is a kind of mind virus, and the way it works is impossibly clever. It shields us from perceiving the harmful aspects of our own behaviors while highly sensitizing us to those of others. The result is that we viciously attack them for it, not realizing that this itself is only a manifestation of our own darkness. Our own parasite is loudly telegraphing its existence to our enemy in order to provoke theirs, which we can then blame them for. The truth is that they are perceiving genuine darkness in us — the very thing that we are contemptuously judging them for. But we cannot admit this, because then we would have no leg to stand on. Indeed, the whole purpose of contempt is to drive the parasite so deeply into their minds that we can convince ourselves that it is not merely a parasite, but actually _intrinsic_ to their minds; that they are _fundamentally_ defective and thus beyond help. The more we do this, the easier it becomes to overlook the self-serving aspects of our own actions and agendas.

This is the trap in which the whole world is caught; darkness provoking darkness at every turn without anyone recognizing their own complicity. We each feel like we are advancing our righteous agendas, but the only real winner is the darkness itself. This is why we sometimes suspect the existence of an "evil global conspiracy." The parasites in all of our minds are conspiring, together behaving more like a singular _distributed malevolent entity_, manipulating all of humanity from beneath our conscious thresholds. The Christians know it as the Devil, and the Buddhists call it the ego. You can treat it as a metaphor, but it is also as real as anything you can touch. It is the _primordial_ evil conspiracy; the one to which all the rest owe their existence, and to which they ultimately filter up. Every act of unkindness we have ever perpetrated on _anyone_ has secretly been in its service — and part of us has always known this. But this knowledge rarely reaches conscious awareness. We only hear the part of our mind that cleverly calculates how our behavior was a net good. The knowledge of our darkness exists in a kind of limbo state, but we _can_ learn to become fully conscious of it. When we do, something astonishing happens.

When the darkness lifts, it feels exactly like you'd imagine feeling being freed of a demonic possession. Underneath it is a Light so vast it defies description. It is what you most essentially are. You see that you never truly wanted to cause harm; never _could_ want such a thing — nor, surprisingly, could anybody else. In fact, it turns out that you _are_ everyone and everything else, just pretending that you're not. One consciousness, looking out through countless eyes.  There are many ways to say this, all of which sound absurd to the rational mind, but the deepest part of you knows it to be true. When you fully unveil the Light in yourself, you automatically see it in everyone else — including those who normally seem not to have any. This is what the darkness is trying to hide. Every selfish act ultimately harms you, and every selfless act benefits you — the _real_ you, so to speak. This is what humanity is slowly waking up to. But make no mistake: it is not all rainbows and sunshine.

You discover that you could _always_ perceive the Light in others — and thus you knew perfectly well that you were only shoving them deeper into the abyss; smothering their inner Light as it desperately (if unskillfully) tried to free itself of its shackles. You knew that you could get away with this, because almost nobody else could consciously perceive it: they, too, saw only "bad person." But there were always those with the eyes to see. They knew what you were doing — and yet, sinister as it was, they still held the Light for you, knowing that the real you could never want to do it. Sometimes this may have required tough love, but it was always love. It is only thanks to their profound grace that you've found your way out of the bewildering maze of mirrors that is the darkness. Yet they, too, cannot take credit for it; for this grace utterly transcends personal achievement.

You now stand face-to-face with all the harm you've ever perpetrated on the world since time immemorial, and it is far more than you could hope to clean up in a single lifetime. Seeing this hurts more than you can fathom. How widely and quickly it spread! The darkness exploited your fear and pride, enabling you to do things you couldn't have if only you had seen what was really happening. You lost contact with your absolute goodness, and went out searching for it _relatively_ — that is, by making other people bad. How ironic that our faint memory of our original goodness ends up causing so much harm! Of course, it is still your responsibility to clean it up. Your only atonement is to firmly commit to holding the Light for others, even when — indeed, _especially_ when — they cannot hold it for themselves. Far from being a burden, you discover that this has always been your true purpose; your deepest calling.

This is called compassion, and it has nothing to do with being nice. True compassion can be fierce, or even violent, as the situation warrants. Its only defining characteristic is that it is utterly free of self-deception. It does not perceive evil as intrinsic to any mind, and this seemingly-subtle change makes all the difference. It surgically targets the parasite itself, instead of the confused being who unwittingly harbors it. The profound integrity of this act prevents their darkness from using our own as an excuse to justify itself, thereby bypassing their defense mechanisms. The aspect of mind _beneath_ their parasite is confronted directly — something it is not accustomed to. It begins to remember that the _real_ fight isn't between the two of you, but between both of you and humanity's ultimate nemesis. They may still consciously perceive you as an enemy, but underneath, something much more profound is beginning to happen. Such behavior may not be as darkly pleasurable as violently dominating your enemies, but it is infinitely more valuable — not only to others, but also to you.

To be clear: it does no good to pretend that you can see the Light in others when you cannot. This can backfire miserably, as it rapidly degrades into merely being _nice._ Thus, neither pretending to see the good in others nor overlooking it is a viable strategy for defeating the darkness. The _only_ solution is to learn to actually see it, and the only way to do that is to fully uncover your own. There are countless methods for doing so, encoded both in ancient spiritual traditions and more modern techniques; ranging from meditation to psychedelics to shadow work and more. It is also astonishingly easy to lie to ourselves about whether we are actually wielding fierce compassion or merely pretending to. If there is even a _trace_ of malice, genuine contempt, or self-righteousness, it is always the darkness masquerading as the Light. In fact, the simplest measure of how much we are still hiding from yourself is how much we can still muster these sentiments for our enemies; the "bad people." As long as we still harbor them, we are always liable to slide down the dark path that has enabled all the atrocities there ever were. All that is required is the right — or wrong — confluence of circumstances. It happens faster than you can imagine. You _do not_ want to find yourself there.

There are vast and subtle networks of causality that we are normally unconscious of, and that secretly drive the fate of the world. If we pay attention only to the surface activity, we are missing out on the vast majority of what shapes our reality. Evil can look sweet and pretty, while kindness is sometimes violent. It is impossible to know which is which — and easy to convince ourselves otherwise — until we have done the deep inner work that melts the core confusion. So much of human activity is subtly (or grossly) self-deceptive — and any time any one of us engages in it, we induce the same tendency in others, be they friend or foe. Our true allies are not those who push the same agendas we do, nor are our enemies necessarily those who oppose us. At the ultimate level, something much more profound is going on. To divide the world into the fundamentally good and bad is to miss the point. Your true enemy lies within, and the more you defeat it "in here," the more it vanishes "out there." What lies underneath is a profound Love for all of reality; one that excludes nothing and forsakes no-one, including the targets of its fearsome wrath, should that be necessary. Forsaking others ultimately only forsakes ourselves.

I wish I could tell you that I have completed the journey myself, but I've only learned enough to see that I am still far from it. Yet we each catch glimpses from time to time, and it is our duty to carry those glimpses into the world as best we are able. I am still liable to mess things up while believing otherwise, and I hope you will hold my feet to the fire when I do. All I can do is promise to do the same for you.

May all beings be free from suffering and its causes. Amen.
