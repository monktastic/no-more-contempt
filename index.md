We know that being kind is the "right thing to do" in most situations, but things get hazy when it comes to "bad" people. Not only is it hard to be kind to them, but it's a bit unclear _why_ and even _whether_ we should. At the same time, there are many people who seem to be "bad" enough for this question to be relevant to us. They may not deserve our cruelty (yet), but they surely deserve our contempt. It feels like the _least_ we could do as decent people.

But what if there is a sense in which kindness (properly defined) is _always_ the right thing to do, and our "innocent" deviation from it is responsible for tremendously more suffering than we realize?

This site is a collection of pieces exploring that theme.

Contempt is hard to define, but here's a rough starting point: it's the feeling that someone is worthless or beneath consideration — often accompanied by a desire to make sure they know it. It is the sense that they are fundamentally defective (in the case of "bad people," fundamentally _morally_ defective). We generally want the best for people, even when they mess up. With contempt, this desire evaporates, and may even be replaced with malice. It often starts off much milder, with subtle feelings of suspicion and uncharitability. But these turn out to be self-reinforcing, as we shall see.
