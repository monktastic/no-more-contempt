We each have our own ideas about "what's wrong with the world," and who is responsible. When we think about them, we tend to feel contempt. This seems like a healthy way to affirm our values, convey our disapproval, and deter others from similar misbehavior — in other words, to help us "fight evil" and save the world.

But what if it is a trap? What if this behavior is somehow creating the very conditions that enable the atrocities that we decry?

> _And no wonder, for even Satan masquerades as an angel of light._ —2 Corinthians 11:14

You know the classic image of the angel and devil sitting on our shoulders? It's _almost_ accurate, except for two things. First, the angel isn't really external to you, but represents the deepest aspect of your mind; your profound love for the world. In a deep sense, it *is* you. The devil is external; a kind of parasite[^intrinsic]. But it doesn't just whisper obviously-bad ideas in your ear; it pretends to be your inner angel, and alters your very perception so that evil appears righteous.

> _Be kind, for everyone you meet is fighting a great battle._ —Author unknown

Part of us *knows* when we are under the sway of our devil, but that knowledge is cleverly shielded from conscious self-reflection. This self-deception is enabled by some kind of "battle" that you may not even be conscious of. Your angel knows that this is how _all_ evil ultimately works, and so you're not fundamentally different from the "bad people." But your devil has a trick: it makes you perceive their evil as _intrinsic_, so that they appear fundamentally defective, and therefore worthy of harm.

In this shadowy state, you cannot help but darken the world — often in ways that you will never (consciously) recognize your own complicity in.

> _Ultimately evil is done not so much by evil people, but by good people who do not know themselves and who do not probe deeply._ —Roland Niebuhr

Even if you don't know _how_ to darken it, your malicious intent is being telegraphed in a thousand tiny ways, which other people will (maybe only subconsciously) pick up on as "evil." This signals to _their_ devils that it's safe to come out and join the party. If you are around your enemies, you will trigger each other into a downward spiral. If you are with your "allies," you will work each other into a violent froth. Either way, more evil is being created, and it will feel unmistakably _righteous_.

</p>

It is as though our devils are secretly coordinating to induce this shadowy state in the world. That is their *goal*: to pave the way for more evil. In fact, they behave more like outgrowths of a single shared "shadowy presence" that continually manipulates all of our minds; the _Devil_, if you will.

This is not just a religious invention: I think that everyone who introspects carefully enough eventually perceives this "distributed malevolent entity" which has a kind of intelligence and volition of its own that, even if not _literally_ true, explain its seemingly-coordinated behavior terrifyingly well. 

<p align="center" width="100%">
    <img width="300px" src="img/shared-devil.png"> 
</p>

It is the primordial "evil global conspiracy," to which all the rest ultimately owe their existence — and _we_ are its unwitting minions. Every attempt to maliciously subdue it "out there" just strengthens it, because such behavior is only ever initiated _by_ it, even though it makes us believe that it was initiated by us. **Any** time you feel malice, hatred, contempt, or even self-righteousness toward another being; any time you see them as fundamentally defective or inferior; you are being manipulated into feeding the Beast.

To be clear: there may well be groups of particularly "bad" people who conspire to cause great harm, but their existence wouldn't be possible if the rest of us weren't feeding the source — and conversely, it is _inevitable_ given that we are. **We must hold such people accountable**, but when we do this with contempt, we are reinforcing the conditions that effectively _compel_ their existence.

If we (the "good people") don't realize how easily we're being seduced by our evil, how in Hell do we expect the "bad people" to? The truth is, we _don't_ — because if they did, then we wouldn't be able to maintain our vaunted position as the "good people." This need to be special is precisely what allows our devils to so easily take control of our minds. It is what the Buddhists call the _ego._

Our true enemy is not other people, but the dark "entity" that has captured _all_ of our minds. By keeping our attention fixated perpetually outward, it ensures that we never introspect deeply enough to discover how it works, and thereby discover how to end it.

> *The shadow is a moral problem that challenges the whole ego-personality, for no one can become conscious of the shadow without considerable moral effort. To become conscious of it involves recognizing the dark aspects of the personality as present and real. This act is the essential condition for any kind of self-knowledge.* —Carl Jung

The more thoroughly you uncover this trick in yourself, the more clearly you perceive how nearly the whole world has fallen for it, and the less able you are to hate them for it. The less hatred you harbor, the more easily your "angel" can perceive the hidden causes of their self-deception, and the more it can do about it. This is called compassion. It is the only way to weaken the "Devil."

It doesn't mean being _nice_. Compassion can outwardly be as fierce (or violent[^dalai-lama-gun], or even _apparently_ contemptuous) as the situation warrants, but these behaviors come from a completely different source. People can subconsciously sense your motivation even when you think they can't — in fact, even when _you_ (consciously) can't — and it makes all the difference in the world.

Compassion is the natural byproduct of realizing of the vast interconnectedness of reality; perception of our fundamental unity. Seeing this in its entirety is _enlightenment._ But long before enlightenment, [we are all able to sense it](unity.md) to one degree or another.

Compassion doesn't always know what the most beneficial behavior _is_. It merely ensures that you are behaving in a way that is aligned with your deepest values; your profound love for the world. Determining the most effective behavior requires _wisdom_, which is a vast topic, and beyond the scope of this work. There is no doubt that dealing with profound evil in the real world is _hard._

> *Such a man knows that whatever is wrong in the world is also in himself, and if he only learns to deal with his own shadow, he has done something real for the world. He has succeeded in shouldering at least an infinitesimal part of the gigantic, unsolved problems of our day.* —Carl Jung

Enlightenment may be a lofty goal, but we can start small, by changing social norms. We can teach our children that contempt for "bad people" isn't what it seems to be, and refuse to join our allies when we can sense that their motivation isn't "clean." Contempt[^contempt] must go the way of all other forms of evil if we are to defeat our true enemy.

## Footnotes

[^contempt]: Specifically, we mean (genuine) contempt for *people*. Contempt for ideas or behaviors can actually be healthy, as perhaps can (apparent) contempt that is rooted in genuine compassion.

[^intrinsic]: You may wonder how it is possible to know that evil is not intrinsic to other people's minds, but for our purposes it's more important to see that (1) our _perception_ of their intrinsic defectiveness is our own projection, and (2) our own darkness gives us the capacity to devolve into a condition in which others would be utterly convinced that _ours_ is intrinsic.

[^dalai-lama-gun]: The Dalai Lama was once asked what you should do if a gunman is trying to shoot you and you have a gun. [He said "shoot back."](https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/dalai-gun/)
