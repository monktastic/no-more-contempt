> _Be kind, for everyone you meet is fighting a great battle._ —Author unknown

We each have our own ideas about "what's wrong with the world," and who is responsible. When we think about them, we tend to feel contempt. This seems like a healthy way to affirm our values, convey our disapproval, and deter others from similar misbehavior. In other words, it helps us "fight evil" and save the world.

But what if it is a trap?

Contempt[^contempt] actually has a sinister origin, and produces far-ranging toxic effects that are not only invisible to us, but carefully _hidden_ from us by our own minds. It is not our friend: it fosters conditions in which the problems we bemoan are all but inevitable. At the micro level, this explains bitter divorces in which each side feels like the exclusive victim / hero; and at the macro level, why the US is headed toward civil war despite nobody recognizing their own complicity.

It is imperative that we discover this trick by which our mind hides the true source and effects of our behavior — not only for our own sake, but the world's. When it is fully unveiled, the problems of the world — and their solutions — begin to look radically different.

> _If only it were all so simple! If only there were evil people somewhere insidiously committing evil deeds, and it were necessary only to separate them from the rest of us and destroy them. But the line dividing good and evil cuts through the heart of every human being. And who is willing to destroy a piece of his own heart?_ —Alexander Solzhenitsyn

> _And no wonder, for even Satan masquerades as an angel of light. So it is not strange that his ministers also masquerade as ministers of righteousness._ —2 Corinthians 11:14

We've all done something wrong while convincing ourselves that it isn't. What we may not realize is that _all_ evil ultimately depends on this very mechanism of self-deception. We are motivated _not_ to see this, because then we can believe that we are fundamentally different from the "bad people." _We treat them with contempt to bait them into behaving in ways that license more contempt, to reaffirm our moral superiority._

Unfortunately, such behavior is hardly "morally superior," so we must carefully hide this true motivation from ourselves. We label it "fighting evil," and calculate the ways in which it will actually help the world. This is *itself* an act of self-deception — and perhaps the hardest to detect, because it feels so righteously motivated. But seeing how our mind hides this truth is key to understanding how the "bad people" do what _they_ do without feeling bad.

Once you see this, everything changes.

> _How can you say to your brother, `Let me take the speck out of your eye,' when all the time there is a plank in your own eye? You hypocrite, first take the plank out of your own eye, and then you will see clearly to remove the speck from your brother's eye._ —Matthew 7:4

You discover that there is darkness within each of us. It is not _intrinsic_ to our minds[^intrinsic], but is more like a parasite. It knows that we are only willing to harm people who we deem _subhuman_[^subhuman], so it does something very clever: it alters our perception so that we see some people's darkness as intrinsic to their minds; we see them as _fundamentally_ bad, and therefore subhuman.

Consciously, we don't realize that we're being manipulated by our darkness; it feels like we're expressing a natural and healthy instinct to violently attack evil — which we now equate with attacking _people_, since we can no longer distinguish the two. But no matter how subdued our attack (e.g., mockery), our underlying malicious intent makes _us_ appear evil to them for exactly the same reason that they appear evil to us.

This has the effect of driving their darkness deeper into their minds, making them appear even more "fundamentally" bad, which licenses even more righteous violence from us, resulting in an all-too-familiar downward spiral. But the real shock is discovering that this mutual descent into Hell is secretly being orchestrated by the darkness in _both_ of our minds.

Our darkness tricks us into behaving in ways that it knows will convince others that we are evil, because it knows exactly how their darkness will respond — _because ours and theirs are fundamentally identical_. In fact, they are not just identical, but are more like outgrowths of a single shared "shadowy presence" that continually manipulates all of our minds; the _Devil_, if you will.

This is not just a wacky religious invention: it seems that everyone who introspects carefully enough eventually perceives this "distributed malevolent entity" with a seeming intelligence and volition of its own that, even if not _literally_ true, explain its apparently-coordinated behavior terrifyingly well. 

It is that primordial "evil global conspiracy" to which all the rest ultimately owe their existence. Every attempt to maliciously subdue it "out there" just strengthens it, because such behavior is only ever initiated _by_ it, even though it makes us believe that it was initiated by us. Contempt is its most insidious tool precisely because it appears to be the most unmistakably righteous. It is a secret way to leak evil deep into the world, where we can disown all complicity for it.

(To be clear: there may well be groups of particularly "bad" people who conspire to cause great harm, but their existence wouldn't be possible if the rest of us weren't feeding the source — and conversely, it is _inevitable_ given that we are. **We must hold such people accountable**, but when we do this with contempt, we are reinforcing the conditions that effectively _compel_ their existence.)

Our true enemy is not other people, but the parasite in all of our minds. Contempt is nothing but a way to hide that fact from ourselves.

The only way for humanity to defeat the "Devil" is to stop falling for its tricks. _Any_ time you feel malice, contempt, or even self-righteousness toward another being; any time you see them as fundamentally defective or inferior; you are being manipulated into spreading evil in some way that you can't yet see. As you begin to clear up this misperception in your own mind, you discover more of what is causing it in others', which is the only way to do anything genuinely useful about it.

The topic of what such "useful" behavior looks like is vast and beyond the scope of this work, but rest assured that it _can_ be outwardly violent (or mocking) if the circumstances warrant it. It need not take any particular form, and cannot be reduced to principles, except for one: the more deeply it is rooted in compassion — that is, freedom from the above misperception — the more beneficial it tends to be[^compassion]. Being _entirely_ free is enlightenment; perception of our fundamental unity.

Enlightenment is a lofty goal, but we can start small, by changing social norms. Understanding why _contempt is not the way_ seems like a good first step.

## Footnotes

[^contempt]: Specifically, it is contempt for *people* that is wrong. Contempt for ideas or behaviors can actually be healthy.

[^intrinsic]: You may wonder how it is possible to know that evil is not intrinsic to other people's minds, but for our purposes it's more important to see that (1) our _perception_ of their intrinsic defectiveness is our own projection, and (2) our own darkness gives us the capacity to devolve into a condition in which others would be utterly convinced that _ours_ is intrinsic.

[^subhuman]: Notice that genocides can only be perpetrated when the victims are seen as subhuman. The Nazis referred to Jews as 'vermin,' and during the genocide in Rwanda, Tutsis were referred to as 'cockroaches.' This is a common pattern throughout history.

[^compassion]: You could say that everything comes down to distinguishing when we're being malicious in the name of good vs compassionate in a way that necessitates harm. People can sense the difference, even when we think they can't.
