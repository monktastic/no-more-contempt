> _Be kind, for everyone you meet is fighting a great battle._ —Author unknown

What is kindness? It is the only thing that actually fights evil. Everything else just makes it worse.

---

The deepest part of you can perceive yourself in literally everyone and everything, strange as that may sound; yet you hide this knowledge from your conscious mind, so that you don't have to feel their suffering. It is this same mechanism that enables the "bad people" to do what *they* do: their minds are shielding them from fully perceiving the *life* in their victims — be they other people, animals, or nature at large. This is the secret principle behind *all the evil there ever was.*

Any time any one of us employs this shielding, we lower the threshold for everyone else to do the same — no matter how noble our intent. For example, when we witness evil, we often feel compelled to not only *stop* the evildoer, but to *harm* them — quite independently of any good it will do. This is hard to admit. We tell ourselves that it is "for the greater good," but part of us simply enjoys seeing the "bad people" suffer.

Is this wrong? So long as our behavior produces some good — which it actually might, at least in the short term – why does it matter how we feel about it? All that should matter is the outcome. *So what* if we get to feel a bit of glee from watching "bad people" suffer? It is a private pleasure that has no bearing on the result.

But this is a dark lie.

Not only can our target sense our malicious intent, but we secretly want them to. We're telegraphing to them that we're under the sway of the very sickness we're viciously judging them for, provoking a reaction that lets us frame them as the evil ones. This reaction becomes the 'proof' we need; the justification we crave, to escalate. Something in us *wants* to be forced to unleash the full extent of our righteous wrath — and it will stop at nothing to ensure this outcome.

This is the *only* purpose of contempt (for other people). It is a fundamentally malicious attitude secretly meant to drive the darkness deeper *into* people's minds, where we can violently judge them for it, while giving ourselves plausible deniability: we are only *fighting evil,* after all — and how could that ever be wrong?

It is worth pausing to reflect on the cleverness of this ruse. Simply *entertaining* the darkness in your own mind is sufficient to spread it, despite there being no external evidence of it. The deepest part of us *knows* when we've done this, but we carefully hide this knowledge from our conscious minds, thereby disowning it. Yet that darkness continues to live on in the world, orphaned; giving rise to countless knock-on effects that we never recognize our own connection to.

It is not until we appreciate the terrifying genius of this mechanism that we begin to recognize exactly what is going on in the minds of the "bad people," and how we can be of service in ending it. It's not that they *don't know* that they're doing wrong, but something is preventing them from fully confronting it — and this "something" is profoundly intertwined with our own decisions, much as we hate to admit it. In fact, it is this *refusal to admit it* that allows it to thrive.

> _And no wonder, for even Satan masquerades as an angel of light. So it is not strange that his ministers also masquerade as ministers of righteousness._ —2 Corinthians 11:14-16

Evil is a kind of mind-virus. We recognize it easily in others but never in ourselves. It tricks us into perceiving them as *fundamentally defective* and thus completely unlike us; never realizing that this very attitude is the surest sign that we are under its dark command. By acceding to this misperception, we are silently affirming that *darkness is the way.* It is like a secret handshake between our darkness and theirs — which it turns out aren't separate at all.

<p align="center" width="100%">

The Darkness behaves more like a _singular distributed malevolent entity_, manipulating all of humanity from beneath our conscious thresholds. The Christians know it as the Devil, and the Buddhists call it the ego. You can treat it as a metaphor, but it is as real as anything you can touch. It is why we sometimes suspect the existence of an evil global conspiracy. It is the _primordial_ evil conspiracy; the one to which all the rest owe their existence and to which they ultimately filter up.

This entity drives us relentlessly toward Armageddon — situations in which everyone is violently proving how _righteous_ they are. It is why the US may be headed toward civil war, and explains bitter [divorces](https://www.gottman.com/blog/this-one-thing-is-the-biggest-predictor-of-divorce/)  where each side feels like the exclusive victim / hero. Nearly the whole world is caught in its terrible sway, evil provoking evil at every turn, without anyone recognizing its true origin deep within our psyches.

Every act of unkindness we've ever perpetrated on anyone; all the hardness we carry in our hearts; has only ever been in service of humanity's ultimate nemesis.

To be clear: there really *are* people who knowingly serve the Darkness, and who conspire to cause great harm. They must be stopped, and this isn't always "nice." But to the extent that we perceive them as *fundamentally* defective, or ourselves as *intrinsically superior* — in short, with contempt — we are falling into the ultimate trap. Contempt for *beliefs* or *behaviors* isn't necessarily harmful, but contempt for people always is. It exists only to help us hide our own darkness from ourselves by reinforcing it in others — allies, enemies, and bystanders alike.

The vast majority of dark behavior feels **absolutely nothing like evil**. It simply feels like "business as usual." We find all kinds of ways to justify self-serving behavior, using the sorry state of the world as an excuse. Corporations cheat us, so what's wrong with skimming from them? Our political opponents are morally defective, so why shouldn't we mock and shame them? An infinite variety of examples abounds, most of which are too subtle to capture in words.

It is not that skimming or shaming are inherently wrong, but we disregard that quiet voice warning us that we are lying to ourselves. The more we lie, the more we lose the ability to even detect that it *is* a lie. The "little voice" gets increasingly drowned out by clever justifications, which we fail to recognize as such — because why would our own minds lie to us? 

This is the trap in which modern humanity is caught. We have abandoned our inner knowing for clever judgments, writing off such knowing as religious myth.

<p align="center" width="100%">

</p>

Every time any one of us makes this mistake — which happens *far more often* than we realize — we are strengthening the same capacity in everyone else. The dark lies that politicians use to foment wars are made of the very same "stuff" as the lies we tell ourselves. Again, it's not just the same *kind* of stuff. Every act of self-deception gets woven into the very fabric of our reality, accumulating in the body politic, reconfiguring itself, eventually erupting in the form of atrocities that we feel *absolutely no connection* to — and which then serve as justification for *more*.

Without recognizing our own role in all this, it is impossible to do actual good in the world. Instead, we will continually buy into whichever narratives sound best — never recognizing that no matter how "good" they are, we are secretly just feeding the Beast. If we really want to know whether a cause is "good" or not, we cannot simply evaluate its *contents*. We must be able to feel into its *origin.* **So much suffering** could be avoided if we only learned to recognize this.

Thus, the entire fight against evil comes down to recognizing this "deeper knowing." For it is only by seeing how cleverly the darkness has manipulated our own minds that we discover the true meaning of *kindness* — and to appreciate its unique power to defeat our common nemesis.

> _For so long as the root of wickedness is hidden, it is strong. But when it is recognized, it is dissolved. When it is revealed, it perishes. ... It is powerful because we have not recognized it._ — The Gospel of Philip

There can be moments in life — such as during psychedelic trips, near-death experiences, or deep meditation or prayer — when you are confronted with the full depths of your own self-deception. You are shown every single instance where you skirted your conscience; every act of lying to yourself for your own personal gain. You are brought face-to-face with all the harm you've ever perpetrated from time immemorial, and it is more than you could hope to clean up in a single lifetime. The pain is beyond what you can fathom; more than you can bear. How widely and quickly it spread! How many it affected! The darkness exploited your fear and pride, enabling you to do things you couldn't have if only you had been totally honest.

The guilt is overwhelming. But then it dawns on you: the only reason it hurts so much is that you never actually wanted to do this. It is only profound confusion that enabled it. Your whole being is absorbed into that part of you that never wanted to hurt anyone; never _could_ want such a thing. Then, suddenly, the full mass of darkness lifts from your mind. It feels like being freed of a demonic possession. Beneath it is a Light so vast that it defies description; an infinite Love for all of reality that excludes nothing and forsakes no-one. This Light is what you ultimately are — *wonder of wonders* — and surprisingly, *so is everyone else*.

In fact, you ultimately _are_ everyone and everything else, just pretending that you're not. One consciousness, peering out through countless eyes. There are many ways to say this, all of which sound absurd to the rational mind. But when you fully unveil the Light in yourself, you automatically see it in everyone else — including those who convincingly seem not to have any. This is what the darkness is trying to hide.

Everything we do to each other — or to Nature herself — we ultimately do to ourselves. It is impossible to benefit ourselves at the world's expense, because we *are* the world. How crazy to think otherwise! How foolish to judge others for not seeing it, when we couldn't see it yet ourselves! In fact, this is the only way we *could* judge them. 

We are continually shoving each other into the abyss to prevent others from waking up, because we're not ready to wake up ourselves. Seeing this, we lose all desire to "get away" with anything. Why would we want to? How did we ever think we could?

The strangest part is discovering how you simultaneously _knew_ all this and yet somehow _didn't_. You convinced yourself that your unkind behavior was "for the greater good," even as you knew better. You could always perceive the Light in the "bad people," but chose to violently smother it anyway — believing that if you compartmentalized knowledge of this crime carefully enough, nobody could blame you for it, because _you yourself_ would no longer know. Yet they somehow always knew.

You now see _how_ they knew despite your astonishingly clever attempts to hide it. At the very deepest level, your mind is not separate from theirs. It's not that others can read your mind, per se, but your inner motivations inevitably leak into your outer reality; the two being fundamentally inseparable. Everything you do "in here" has an impact "out there," whether you see it or not.

The deepest motivation of all is to be of service to the Whole and not just to a part. This is a choice you make in every moment, whether you know it or not. Others can sense this choice at a subconscious level, and it influences their own. Your unwillingness to forsake them under any circumstances slowly reminds their darkness of the *one thing* it can never truly hide from. This is the *only* way that evil evaporates from our world. If you been freed from your own, it is only due to the grace of countless "others," whom you now honor by paying it forward.

There is no way to force others to see any of this; force being a manifestation of the same fundamental mistake. Those who are most powerful at inducing this realization in others are simply those who hold it most strongly themselves. They are literally incapable of feeling malice, contempt, or self-righteousness toward *anybody* for *any reason*, having thoroughly recognized them as weapons of the Darkness. Yet such people are not weak. They are unafraid to fiercely confront the darkness in others. 

This is true kindness, and it has nothing to do with being nice. It need not take any form in particular. Its only defining characteristic is that it is utterly free of self-deception. It surgically targets the parasite itself, instead of the confused being who unwittingly harbors it. The profound integrity of this act prevents their parasite from finding the excuse it would otherwise use to reinforce itself, and is weakened as a result. The more entrenched a person's darkness, the more fierce the kindness required to uproot it. It may be tough love, but it is always Love.

In the same way that your darkness can extend a secret handshake to others, your Light can do the same. It is nowhere near as violently pleasurable as subjugating them, but infinitely more valuable.

If we ultimately are the Light, how on Earth did we get to this place that looks nothing like it? This process is extremely tricky to convey, because it doesn't fit into our culture's standard metaphysics. We began as undifferentiated Light, but then made the mistake of subtly turning away from it. Then, fearing that we'd lost contact with our _absolute_ goodness, we went out seeking for it _relatively_ — that is, at the expense of "others." This simultaneously *created* those "others," who we then felt compelled to violently defeat, in order to prove our own goodness and thereby return Home. But this just made things worse, and the whole thing quickly spiraled out of control. This is the apparent reality in which we now live.

The hardest thing to communicate about this story is that it does not unfold in what we normally conceive of as linear time. In a profound and surprising sense, every moment is the very first. Thus, every instant is an opportunity to rediscover our primordial Home, a place we never truly left. Each time we see this, we increasingly discover how our judgements of others are actually pointers back to an unhealed part of ourselves. As we heal ourselves, we discover how to heal our relationship with the "other," until it slowly dawns on us that there was never truly an "other."

The more we see this, the more we vow to hold the Light for these seeming others, even when — indeed, _especially_ when — they cannot hold it for themselves. Far from being a burden, we discover that this has always been our true purpose; our deepest calling. Every encounter with evil becomes an opportunity to strengthen our commitment to the Light.

Looked at this way, kindness is anything that brings us all closer to remembering the truth, and evil is anything that pushes us away from it. Forsaking others is thus always a form of evil. It is a form of forsaking ourselves, because we are not ready to come Home yet. If this language feels too religious for you, feel free to find your own framing. In the end, there is only one Truth.

> *Darkness cannot drive out darkness, only light can do that. Hate cannot drive out hate, only love can do that.* ― Martin Luther King, Jr.

Unlike the Light, the darkness is not a real entity. It is a profound absence masquerading as a presence. This is why it cannot be defeated by more absence. Yet make no mistake: it still behaves like a sinister presence. It manipulates our perception at such a fundamental level that we simply cannot fathom that we're being fooled. We're certain that we're seeing reality _as it is_. It is an _impossibly_ clever trick, but one we can learn to see through.

Revenge fantasy films, YouTube videos of "Karens getting owned," Facebook threads full of casual cruelty and jokes about "Darwin awards" — each is a breeding ground for our collective Demon. It all seeps into our physical reality, slowly poisoning it. Everything from our unhealthy air, water, and soil, to our myriad societal ills and the climate crisis itself, is ultimately an external manifestation of a sickness within. As long as we perceive it to exist only in others, we will never discover its hidden aspect in ourselves. This is in no way suggesting that we are all equally complicit. Yet we each have a unique role to play in leading us all back to the Light.

To be clear: it does no good to pretend that we can see the Light in others when we can't. Doing so can backfire miserably. Thus, both pretending to see the Light in others and overlooking it can be harmful. The only solution is to learn to *actually* see it, which happens as a natural consequence of unveiling our own. Similarly, it is astonishingly easy to lie to ourselves about whether our violent behavior is "radical kindness" or merely self-deception. This is a common way for the darkness to sneak in.

Perhaps the clearest measure of our ability to deceive ourselves is how much contempt we still feel for our enemies. To the degree that this potential is still present, we are susceptible to sliding down the dark path that has enabled every genocide, without ever realizing that we are. All that is required is the right — or wrong — confluence of circumstances. To believe yourself immune is the greatest of follies, and the surest indication that you are *not.*

There are vast and subtle networks of causality that we normally hide from ourselves, and that secretly drive the fate of the world. Everything we do makes a difference, in ways that we can hardly fathom. If we pay attention only to the surface activity, we miss out on the bulk of what actually shapes our reality. Evil can look sweet and pretty, while kindness sometimes looks nothing of the sort. It is impossible to know which is which — and easy to convince ourselves otherwise — until we have done the deep inner work that eradicates the core confusion. 

We each catch glimpses of the Light from time to time, and it is our duty to carry them into the world as best we are able. I wish I could tell you that I have completed the journey myself, but alas, I am a mere fledgling. I am still liable to mess things up royally, and I only ask that you hold my feet to the fire when I do — for all of our sakes. I promise to do the same for you.

May all beings be free from suffering and its causes. Amen.
