Evil is a kind of mind virus, and the way it works is exceptionally clever. It blinds us to the harmful and self-serving aspects of our own actions while powerfully sensitizing us to those of others. When we look in the eyes of our enemies, we see evil, which makes us want to viciously attack it by attacking _them_. The problem is, this only triggers their defense mechanisms, driving them further into the hands of their parasite. In truth, we were _hoping_ for this outcome, because the deeper we can shove them into the dark, the easier it becomes to convince ourselves that they are _fundamentally_ defective; that their evil is _intrinsic_ to their minds, unlike ours. They're not just acting out evil, like we all sometimes do; no, they simply _are_ evil. In this state, cruelty becomes noble, and we increasingly overlook the self-serving aspects of our own actions and agendas.

The deepest part of us can always perceive that they're acting from a parasite; one that we ourselves are highly susceptible to. This part has a much wiser way of dealing with evil — one that actually works, even if it brings less self-righteous satisfaction. Our mistake was choosing to listen to the _other_ voice; the one that told us we are intrinsically superior. The moment we made this choice, we _knew_ that our behavior would darken the world — and it is _this_ that our enemy picked up on. In that moment, they _knew_ that we were engaged in the very self-deception that we are so contemptuously judging them for. It is as though our own parasite secretly telegraphed itself to them, knowing fully well that their parasite would use it as an excuse to further ingratiate itself to them. In other words, our contempt acted as a kind of secret handshake between their darkness and ours. We may be enemies on the surface, but underneath, our darkness is secretly allied.

This is why we sometimes suspect the existence of an "evil global conspiracy." Our parasites are indeed conspiring, together behaving like a singular _distributed malevolent entity_, manipulating all of humanity from beneath our conscious thresholds. The Christians know it as the Devil, and the Buddhists call it the ego. You can treat it as a metaphor, but it is also as real as anything you can touch. It is the _primordial_ evil conspiracy; the one to which all the rest owe their existence, and to which they ultimately filter up. Every act of unkindness we have ever perpetrated on _anyone_ has secretly been in its service — and part of us has always known this. But this knowledge rarely reaches conscious awareness. It exists in a kind of semi-conscious limbo state — but we _can_ learn to become fully conscious of it. When we do, something astonishing happens.

The darkness suddenly lifts, and it feels exactly like being freed of a demonic possession. Underneath it is what you most essentially are: a Light so vast it defies description. You see that you never truly wanted to hurt anyone; never _could_ want such a thing — nor, surprisingly, could anybody else. It was only profound confusion that allows us to. In truth, you ultimately _are_ everyone and everything else, just pretending that you're not. One consciousness, looking out through countless eyes.  There are many ways to say this, all of which sound absurd to the rational mind, but the deepest part of you knows it to be true. When you fully unveil the Light in yourself, you automatically see it in everyone else — including those who normally seem not to have any. This is what the darkness is trying to hide. Everything we do to each other — or to Mother Nature — ultimately comes back to us, one way or another. This is what humanity is slowly waking up to. But make no mistake: it is not all rainbows and sunshine.

You discover that you could _always_ perceive the Light in others — and thus you knew perfectly well that you were only shoving the "bad people" deeper _into_ the abyss; smothering their inner Light under the guise of good. You knew you could get away with it, because everyone else was pretending not to know, either, in a kind of unspoken social contract. _Of course_ cruelty and contempt are how we deal with evil! What could be wrong with that? But there were always those with the eyes to see. They knew what you were doing — and yet, sinister as it was, they never gave up on you, seeing you for who you really were. This may have sometimes required tough love, but it was love nonetheless. It is only thanks to their profound grace that you've found your way out of the bewildering maze. Yet they do not take credit for it, for this grace utterly transcends personal achievement. You are brought to your knees with tears of immense gratitude. The Light is real after all.

But you now stand face-to-face with all the harm you've ever perpetrated on the world since time immemorial, and it is far more than you could hope to clean up in a single lifetime. Seeing this hurts more than you can fathom. How widely and quickly it spread! How many it affected! The darkness exploited your fear and pride, enabling you to do things you otherwise couldn't have, if only you had seen what was really happening. But you looked away from your Light, thereby losing contact with your _absolute_ goodness. This made you go out seeking for it _relatively_ — that is, at the expense of others. The need to be seen as _good_ tricked you into making other people bad. Such an innocent mistake, yet it is still your responsibility to clean it up. Your only atonement is to firmly commit to holding the Light for others, even when — indeed, _especially_ when — they cannot hold it for themselves. Far from being a burden, you discover that this has always been your true purpose; your deepest calling.

This is called compassion, and it has nothing to do with being nice. True compassion can be fierce, or even violent, as the situation warrants. Its only defining characteristic is that it is utterly free of self-deception. It does not perceive evil as intrinsic to any mind, and this seemingly-subtle change makes all the difference. It surgically targets the parasite itself, instead of the confused being who unwittingly harbors it. The profound integrity of this act prevents their darkness from finding the "hook" in your mind that it would normally use to justify itself. Whereas before, your darkness was secretly conspiring with theirs to strengthen its grip on both of you, now your Light is conspiring with theirs to evict it. This is a bewildering experience for them. They may still consciously perceive you as an enemy, but under the covers, something quite different is happening. The parasite's grip is being weakened.

To be clear: it does no good to pretend that you can see the Light in others when you cannot. This can backfire miserably, as it rapidly degrades into merely being _nice._ Thus, both pretending to see the good in others and overlooking it are harmful. The _only_ solution is to learn to actually see it, and the only way to do that is to fully uncover your own. There are countless methods for doing so, encoded both in ancient spiritual traditions and more modern techniques; ranging from meditation to psychedelics to shadow work and more. 

It is also astonishingly easy to lie to ourselves about whether we are actually wielding fierce compassion or merely pretending to. If there is even a _trace_ of malice, genuine contempt, or self-righteousness, it is always the darkness masquerading as the Light. In fact, the simplest measure of how much we are still hiding from ourselves is how much we can still muster these sentiments for our enemies; the "bad people." As long as we still harbor them, we are always liable to slide down the dark path that has enabled all the atrocities there ever were. All that is required is the right — or wrong — confluence of circumstances. It happens faster than you can imagine. You _do not_ want to find yourself there. You _will_ have to confront it, sooner or later.

There are vast and subtle networks of causality that we are normally unconscious of, and that secretly drive the fate of the world. If we pay attention only to the surface activity, we are missing out on the bulk of what actually shapes our reality. Evil can look sweet and pretty, while kindness may look nothing like our naive interpretations of it. It is impossible to know which is which — and easy to convince ourselves otherwise — until we have done the deep inner work that eradicates the core confusion.

Darkness is ultimately nothing but our willingness to turn away from our inner Light, instead trusting our agendas and justifications. It doesn't feel evil; it just feels... normal. Yet every time any one of us makes this mistake, we induce the same tendency in everyone else. The cumulative effect is indeed evil. To divide the world into the fundamentally good and bad is to miss the point. Your true enemy lies within, and the more you defeat it "in here," the more it vanishes "out there." What lies underneath is a profound Love for all of reality; one that excludes nothing and forsakes no-one, including the targets of its fearsome wrath, should that be necessary. Forsaking others ultimately only forsakes ourselves.

I wish I could tell you that I have completed the journey myself, but I've only learned enough to see that I am still far from it. Yet we each catch glimpses from time to time, and it is our sacred duty to carry those glimpses into the world as best we are able. I am still liable to mess things up while believing otherwise, and I hope you will hold my feet to the fire when I do. All I can do is promise to do the same for you.

May all beings be free from suffering and its causes. Amen.
