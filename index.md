> _Be kind, for everyone you meet is fighting a great battle._ —Author unknown

Looking at the state of the world, you could be forgiven for believing that there's an _evil global conspiracy_ pulling the strings from behind the scenes. In a sense, there is — but it's not the one that you're probably thinking of.

---

People are only able to cause harm due to a kind of self-deception: part of them knows _perfectly well_ that they are doing wrong, but the full implications of their behavior are carefully shielded from conscious self-reflection. All they hear are their own clever justifications. It is this secret mechanism that has enabled _all the evil there ever was_ — and it has enabled our own misbehavior too, if we're honest. Every one of us has skirted our conscience before, pretending either that we couldn't hear it or that we didn't have to listen.

Our self-deception hides itself from us while tricking us into perceiving other people's as _intrinsic evil_. This makes us violently attack them, which they subconsciously recognize as self-deception, making them perceive _us_ as evil, which they then use as further justification for their misbehavior. _This is what we secretly wanted_. Their recalcitrance, combined with our "inability" to see that we provoked it, together serve as "proof" that they are evil, thus licensing us to escalate.

This is just one of a million clever little ways that the darkness "in here" amplifies the darkness "out there" while hiding itself from us. Every act of self-deception lowers the threshold for darkness to manifest elsewhere, so that we will not only feel no connection to it, but will feel compelled to pile on _more._ It keeps us fixated on the darkness "out there" specifically so that we never notice what is happening "in here." It is such a clever trap that it almost smells... designed.

In truth, there is no darkness "in here" and darkness "out there"; there is only the one _Darkness_, behaving like a distributed malevolent entity, flowing freely between minds, shape-shifting at every turn, tricking us into tilting at windmills. Just when you think you've caught a hold of it in someone else's mind, it sneaks out the back door of theirs and enters through yours. You have unknowingly invited it in — and once it is there, you are completely at its mercy; your internal detectors having been taken offline.

This is what we are sensing when we suspect an "evil global conspiracy." It is the _primordial_ evil conspiracy; the one to which all the rest owe their existence, and to which they ultimately filter up. Almost everything we do to "fight" it is secretly in its service. It is made of the disowned aspects of all of our minds working together. We will never fully unearth it "out there" until it has been excavated "in here."  You can treat this as an allegory, but you can also learn to perceive it clearly and directly.

> _For so long as the root of wickedness is hidden, it is strong. But when it is recognized, it is dissolved. When it is revealed, it perishes. ... It is powerful because we have not recognized it._ — The Gospel of Philip

Everything comes down to detecting its dark presence in your mind. At a coarse level, it feels like malice, contempt (for people), or self-righteousness. These are _always_ hidden attempts to darken the world. At a more subtle level, it feels like selfishness and entitlement. Subtler still, like apathy. Your deepest desire is to shine your Light powerfully into this world. It hijacks this noble intention, replacing it with clever counterfeits — such as the violent urge to hunt down other people's darkness.

This is a subtle point, and easily misunderstood. Your Light can indeed hunt down and defeat the Darkness in others, but it does this by showing you how it is _not_ intrinsic to their minds. Contempt is replaced by a fierce compassion. It is as though you are suddenly granted perception of a previously-concealed route through their inner madness; through lifetimes of confusion. When the Light enters that secret place, they remember that they _don't want to be doing this,_ and the Darkness slowly loses its grip.

This is how the Light spreads.

> _And no wonder, for even Satan masquerades as an angel of light. So it is not strange that his ministers also masquerade as ministers of righteousness._ —2 Corinthians 11:14-16

The "evil global conspiracy" hinges entirely on our inability to stay firmly committed to our own Light for long enough to discover this hidden possibility. Every time any one of us steps back into the Darkness; gives in to our self-deception; we hide it a little more from collective view, thus inducing others to throw in the towel. Our greatest gift to this world is to _hold the line_; to refuse to enter the Darkness at any cost. Our own ability to do this has depended on the grace of countless others, such as those who have shown us kindness even when we didn't "deserve" it. We can in turn share that grace and hold the Light for others, _especially_ when they themselves cannot. _It is what we are here for._

This has nothing to do with being nice or gentle. The Light can be fierce; even [violent](https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/dalai-gun/) if the situation warrants it. It can take almost any form whatsoever. Indeed, the more entrenched the Darkness it is "battling," the more it begins to look outwardly like Darkness itself — and thus the easier it gets to lie to ourselves about our true intentions. This is how the Darkness keeps sneaking in the back door of our minds.

> _I wish I could show you, when you are lonely or in darkness, the astonishing Light of your own Being._ —Hafiz of Shiraz

At the ultimate level, you _are_ everyone and everything, in a profound and surprising sense. Realizing this in its entirety is known as _enlightenment_ (en-Light-enment), but all of us can sense it to some degree or another at all times. It is why we sometimes thank others for being generous with strangers even when no (apparent) benefit accrues to us. At some level, we can feel that what happens to any of us affects all of us.

Our true enemy is never other people, but the darkness in all of our minds. The more we heal our own, the more we perceive what is preventing others from giving up theirs, finally enabling us to fight evil in ways that don't secretly reinforce it. Forsaking any one of us forsakes all of us. We only behave this way because we're not ready to come Home yet ourselves, and distancing ourselves from others is a powerful way to keep the illusion alive. This is the true origin of contempt, and thus, of evil.

I am very far from enlightened myself, and don't pretend to have the wisdom to put this knowledge to use in the truly challenging places it is needed most today. But I do wish this perspective to become common knowledge. The more consciously aware we are of this trap, the less willing we will be to tolerate it in our enemies, our allies, and most importantly, ourselves. The Darkness survives by hiding itself. Let us resolve to give it no more safe harbor in the most intimate of places: our very own minds.

> *Nail on the head brother. My most recent mushroom trip (also the largest dose I've ever taken) I became fixated on a news story I had heard that week. About an 8 year old girl from a tribe in the Amazon, who was tied to a tree and burned alive in order to scare her people off their land so it could be logged. I realized that at the moment he did it, whoever lit that gasoline actually felt / thought more or less okay about what he was doing. **And my mind was illuminated with dozens of the parallels between that man's malformed, horrific perceptual / behavioral state, and mine. I saw the same mistakes in value attribution, the same willful ignorance of the consequences of my acts and words. And there was nothing I could do to deny the similarity.***
