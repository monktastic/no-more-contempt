We each have our own ideas about "what's wrong with the world," and who is responsible. When we think about them, we tend to feel contempt. This seems like a healthy way to affirm our values, convey our disapproval, and deter others from similar misbehavior. In other words, it helps us "fight evil" and save the world.

But what if it is a trap?

Contempt[^contempt] actually has a sinister origin, and produces far-ranging toxic effects that are not only invisible to us, but carefully _hidden_ from us by our own minds. It is not our friend: it fosters the very conditions in which the problems we bemoan are all but inevitable. At the micro level, it results in bitter divorces in which each side feels like the exclusive victim / hero; and at the macro level, it explains why the US is headed toward civil war despite nobody recognizing their own complicity.

It is imperative that we discover this trick by which our mind hides the true source and effects of our behavior — not only for our own sake, but the world's. When it is fully unveiled, the problems of the world — and their solutions — begin to look radically different.

> _If only it were all so simple! If only there were evil people somewhere insidiously committing evil deeds, and it were necessary only to separate them from the rest of us and destroy them. But the line dividing good and evil cuts through the heart of every human being._ —Alexander Solzhenitsyn

_tl;dr: The purpose of contempt is to bait people into behavior that confirms our superiority and licenses even more contempt._

Imagine giving someone a dehumanizing stare. It's hard to do, isn't it? It feels evil — because it is. Now imagine that this someone is a "bad person." The worse they are, the more righteous it will feel. Yet it will never look any less evil to them — _because it's not._ And unless they are a saint (which they're not), this will only make them feel _more_ justified in whatever storyline is fueling their misbehavior — because they can now plausibly claim that they are opposing evil.  You will in turn take this as confirmation that _they_ really are evil, and ramp up your dehumanization.

This will result in an all-too-familiar downward spiral. But the big shock is discovering that this is all being orchestrated by a dark aspect within both of your minds. Yours baited theirs, and vice versa. This can all be done subconsciously, through the eyes and tone of voice — no physical violence necessary.

> _And no wonder, for even Satan masquerades as an angel of light._ —2 Corinthians 11:14

You know the classic image of the angel and devil sitting on our shoulders? It's _almost_ accurate, except for two things. First, the angel isn't really external to you, but represents the deepest aspect of your mind. In a profound sense, it *is* you. The devil is external; a kind of parasite[^intrinsic]. But it doesn't just whisper obviously-bad ideas in your ear; it alters your very perception such that evil feels unmistakably righteous. It pretends to _be_ you / your angel. If it does its job well, you won't even feel like you _have_ a devil — at least, not in the way that _bad_ people do.

One of its tricks is to make other people appear subhuman, so that harming them feels okay[^subhuman]. Your morals (and social norms) act as a kind of buffer, so that it can't do this openly with most people. But it's always on the hunt for victims, and it only needs the slightest provocation to begin its manipulation.

> _Be kind, for everyone you meet is fighting a great battle._ —Author unknown

It searches for people whose misbehavior can't be chalked up to a "great battle." Your angel knows that if you look deeply enough, you will _always_ find a kind of battle — and that even though this won't condone their sins, it will prevent you from hating them. So your devil does something clever: it makes you perceive their devil as _intrinsic_ to their minds. You will then see them as _fundamentally defective_ — and therefore subhuman. There is no need to look for any "battle."

This is the wedge it uses to prevent your angel from getting a solid grip. And the nature of _their_ devil is such that you will both rapidly accelerate away from any possibility of mutual humanizing. Both yours and theirs _knew_ this would happen, because they are fundamentally identical. In fact, not only are they identical, but with enough subtlety of perception, you may notice that they act more like puppets of a single _shared_ Devil that is currently flowing freely through humanity.

This is not just a wacky religious invention: it seems that everyone who introspects carefully enough eventually perceives this "distributed malevolent entity" with a seeming intelligence and volition of its own that, even if not _literally_ true, explain its apparently-coordinated behavior terrifyingly well. Your interaction isn't limited to the two of you: it ripples out from each of you into your lives, eventually reaching the far corners of the world.

It is that primordial "evil global conspiracy" to which all the rest ultimately owe their existence. Every attempt to maliciously subdue it "out there" just strengthens it, because such behavior is only ever initiated _by_ it, even though it makes us believe that it was initiated by us. Contempt is its most insidious tool precisely because it appears to be the most unmistakably righteous. It is a secret way to leak evil deep into the world, where we can disown all complicity for it.

(To be clear: there may well be groups of particularly "bad" people who conspire to cause great harm, but their existence wouldn't be possible if the rest of us weren't feeding the source — and conversely, it is _inevitable_ given that we are. **We must hold such people accountable**, but when we do this with contempt, we are reinforcing the conditions that effectively _compel_ their existence.)

Our true enemy is not other people, but the parasite manipulating _all_ of our minds. The greatest gift you can give the world is returning to your "angel"; the only thing that can truly evict the "devil." This "angel" is not weak, and it's not always nice. It can do whatever is required to defeat evil. The only thing it never does is fall into that dark state of mind where it _pretends_ to be doing good while secretly causing mayhem.

_Any_ time you feel malice, contempt, or even self-righteousness toward another being; any time you see them as fundamentally defective or inferior; you are being manipulated into spreading evil in some way that you can't yet see. It is only by clearing up this misperception in your own mind that you begin to see what is causing it in others' — and thereby become able to do something genuinely useful about it.

This is called compassion[^compassion]. It doesn't always know what the most beneficial behavior is. That requires _wisdom_. It only ensures that you are, indeed, behaving in a way that is truly aligned with your deepest values; your profound love for the world. Developing wisdom is a vast topic, and beyond the scope of this work.

When compassion is developed to its full extent, it reveals the vast interconnectedness not only of humanity, but of all of reality. From here, malice and contempt are literally impossible. This is something that is only fully seen upon enlightenment — but we can all sense it to a greater or lesser degree at all times. 

Enlightenment is a lofty goal, but we can start small, by changing social norms. Contempt for "bad people" is the most insidious, and must go the way of all other forms of hatred if we are to survive.

## Footnotes

[^contempt]: Specifically, it is contempt for *people* that is wrong. Contempt for ideas or behaviors can actually be healthy.

[^intrinsic]: You may wonder how it is possible to know that evil is not intrinsic to other people's minds, but for our purposes it's more important to see that (1) our _perception_ of their intrinsic defectiveness is our own projection, and (2) our own darkness gives us the capacity to devolve into a condition in which others would be utterly convinced that _ours_ is intrinsic.

[^subhuman]: Notice that genocides can only be perpetrated when the victims are seen as subhuman. The Nazis referred to Jews as 'vermin,' and during the genocide in Rwanda, Tutsis were referred to as 'cockroaches.' This is a common pattern throughout history.

[^compassion]: You could say that everything comes down to distinguishing when we're being malicious in the name of good vs compassionate in a way that necessitates harm. People can sense the difference, even when we think they can't.
