> _Be kind, for everyone you meet is fighting a great battle._ —Author unknown

The greatest trick the Devil ever pulled was to convince you that he doesn't exist _within your own mind_. The truth is that the more certain you are that you are immune to evil, the more surely you are already under its powerful grip without realizing it.

---

Take a moment to reflect on what's wrong with the world, and bring to mind the people responsible. Don't they seem _fundamentally morally defective_? Do you feel contempt or maybe even malice? It feels like those emotions are there to help you _fight_ evil, but they are actually manifestations _of_ evil. While feeling them, you can only darken the world, even as you are flawlessly convinced that you're helping.

This is not something I can convince you of, so I won't even try. But here's the thing: part of you already knows it. You don't enjoy mocking or shaming your enemies to help them (or anyone else) see the light, or to make the world a better place. You do it to make yourself feel superior. It may temporarily suppress their misbehavior, but it _will_ increase the net hostility and polarization in the world. You may tell yourself that it won't, or that it's their fault if it does, or that the benefits outweigh the drawbacks, but part of you knows that these are just lame excuses for malicious behavior. This is true of _all_ forms of unkindness. This example is just one among many.

This isn't an attack on you. But something within you is actively preventing you from consciously acknowledging the effects of your words and actions. Why? 

Part of you _knows_ that darkness exists within you, and it does everything in its power to shield this horrifying fact from your conscious mind. It makes you actively seek out the evil in others, because viciously attacking theirs takes attention off of your own. Said another way: something within us _needs_ other people to be "bad," so that we can know ourselves as "good" by comparison. So we subconsciously do things that _provoke_ evil in others, unbeknownst to our conscious minds.

Think back to a time when you disobeyed your conscience, pretending either that you couldn't hear it or that you could safely ignore it. When this happens, a schism is created in your mind: part of you knows _perfectly well_ that you're doing wrong, but that knowledge is cleverly hidden from conscious self-reflection. It is then easy to convince others that you _don't_ know, because you have convinced _yourself_. **All evil relies on this mechanism of self-deception**.

Evil (almost) never _feels_ evil. That's the most terrifying thing. One day you wake up and discover that nearly everything you've been doing to "fight evil" has only been amplifying it — and worse, that **part of you always knew this, even as you were doing it**. Until you see that this is going on within you (and clean it up), you have no hope of helping fix the evil "out there." You can only create more, while being supremely confident that you're helping.

The longer you let this condition fester, the more you must hide it from yourself, because the more you subconsciously recognize the horrifying (and increasing) similarity between what you're doing and what you're accusing others of doing: being cruel and pretending that it's okay. Very quickly you find yourself "in too deep" and completely unable to detect this, even when it is pointed out. In fact, when people _do_ point it out, your subconscious registers them as enemies, to "protect" you.

This is where the "bad people" find themselves. Something in them is shielding the _wrongness_ of their behavior from conscious self-reflection — and the more contemptuously you judge them for it, the more they will perceive _you_ as evil and dig in their heels. You will take this as confirmation of _their_ evil, but they are correctly recognizing the same self-deceptive mechanism in you that is operating within them. Part of you is baiting them into seeing you as evil, to justify your contempt — and this _is_ evil. This is how our darkness gets us to escalate violence while blaming it on others.

(The brilliance of this ruse is too amazing not to linger on for a moment. The only thing needed to create new evil is to _appear evil_, because this triggers malice in others. But go ahead and _try_ to appear evil. You can't do it, can you? You know that you're faking it. Now give someone a dehumanizing glare. Put as much contempt and malice into it as you can. There — that feels evil, doesn't it? They can feel it too. Now all that remains is to hide from yourself that you're trying to induce this feeling in others. _Voilà_. This is how we create evil while feeling righteous about it.)

The reason that the "bad people" need to shield their misbehavior is that _part of them doesn't want to be doing wrong._ This means that they are not _fundamentally_ defective. You don't have to take my word for it, but can actually learn to perceive this. If you manage to take your own self-deception mechanism offline, it feels exactly like you'd imagine feeling if you were suddenly freed from a demonic possession. When it lifts, you see that the darkness is not intrinsic to any mind, but has very cleverly commandeered them. We perceive it as intrinsic only to justify our contempt.

To be fair, there seems to be a tiny percentage of people who have invited the demon in, for whom the description "evil" really does capture something important. They pose a much greater challenge, because a large part of them _does_ want it. Being "kind" to them in the conventional sense can indeed be dangerous. And yet the very _deepest_ part of them does not want it. Again, once you see exactly what "it" is, you understand why _nobody_ ultimately could. Think of it as a form of Stockholm syndrome. If you really want to defeat evil, you must want them to be free of it, too.

When we meet (or even hear about) such people, we often experience the overwhelming urge to hate them, but this is the ultimate trap. What we're feeling is the urge to _shove them deeper into the abyss where they "belong."_ The more thoroughly the darkness has ensnared others, the more it behaves like a black hole, sucking away our own light. If we are not alert to this trap, we enter their dark space of mind, in which the deepest evil feels impossibly righteous. Don't fall for it.

How can you know if your self-deception mechanism has "gone offline"? You will clearly perceive your profound interconnectedness with the world. The "great battles" that others are facing will suddenly become obvious, as will your role in having exacerbated them. Malice, contempt [^contempt], and self-righteousness will be recognized as profoundly delusional. You will remember that you are not fundamentally better (or worse) than anyone, and that pretending you are just makes the world darker.

This perspective is not an altered state of mind, but something that is always there yet somehow curiously hidden. It is your deepest and most natural mode of knowing, which is how you will know that you can trust it.

The root of the problem was the desire to be special; what the Buddhists call the _ego_. For those of us with a self-image as "good people," this manifests as the need to be _relatively_ good; i.e., good in comparison to others. This duality forces us to continually create "bad people" in all sorts of subtle ways that we can't consciously recognize. This process only comes to an end when we discover the _absolute_ good within. This is something that we cannot take any credit for[^credit]. Instead, we can only feel profound gratitude for whatever grace allowed us to discover it, and heartbreak that it still remains so deeply hidden in others. The hardest part is watching the whole world being casually cruel to each other, not realizing which "team" they are secretly fighting for. It inspires a fierce determination to fight the "possession" that has captured people's minds, instead of deepening it like we've unwittingly been doing.

This doesn't mean that you will suddenly be nice or lovey-dovey toward evildoers. You may still need to be fierce, or perhaps even violent[^dalai-lama-gun]. Mockery, shaming, or even _apparent_ contempt might still be useful. But it will be in the service of _freeing_ people from the darkness, not pushing them further in. It is a kind of "tough love," and feels _nothing_ like the antagonism that you normally feel when "fighting evil." You are still "connected to your heart." **That is what is most crucial.** Others can sense the profoundly benevolent intent (even if only subconsciously), and it makes _all the difference in the world_.

To put it another way, in every interaction you have two options: to either encourage the Light in others, or to attack their darkness. Encouraging their Light isn't about being _nice_. It is about being completely unwilling to abandon yours under _any circumstances_ — including the one that their darkness is presently using to test you. It is looking for a "hook" in your mind that it can use to justify itself — some sign that even you, the "good person," are ultimately just faking it. If you are unwilling to abandon your integrity even then, the blinding brilliance of your Light _will_ tame their darkness at least a little. Or, said differently, it will remind their Light that it has a partner in the fight.

This is authentic kindness (aka compassion). It is "radical" in that it contradicts our usual intuition, that some people "deserve" our compassion and others don't. It could never be the case that some people deserve to be shoved further into the abyss while others deserve to be freed from it.

<p align="center" width="100%">
    <img width="300px" src="img/good-vs-bad.png"> 
</p>

I know it feels like some people don't _have_ an inner Light to encourage, but this is just an illusion that our darkness uses to get its foot in the door. Once it has tricked us into dividing the world into fundamentally good and bad people — which feels like the most natural thing in the world — it has gained nearly unfettered access to our minds. Then, it is only a matter of time until the right conditions manifest that license us to commit unspeakable horror in the name of "good."[^genocide]

> _And no wonder, for even Satan masquerades as an angel of light._ —2 Corinthians 11:14

You know the classic image of the angel and devil sitting on our shoulders? It's _almost_ accurate, except for two things. First, the angel isn't external to you, but represents your intrinsically compassionate nature. The devil _is_ extrinsic; it is a kind of parasite. But it doesn't just whisper obviously-bad ideas in your ear; it alters your very perception and pretends to _be_ your inner angel.

<p align="center" width="100%">
    <img width="300px" src="img/parasite.png"> 
</p>

It is this devil that tricks you into seeing other people as _fundamentally_ defective, instead of seeing that they are being manipulated by _their_ devils (which is something that your angel _can_ see). Our devils continually trigger each other — not because they are enemies, but _because they are allies_. This is how they strengthen each other. Evil never actually fights evil; it only pretends to, to create more of itself under the guise of good.

In this way, our devils behave more like a single "distributed organism" — the _Devil_, if you will — signaling to itself through the vast network of human minds. It leverages our collective intelligence to produce horrifying outcomes that none of us claim to want, yet which are the inevitable result of our cumulative self-deception.

<p align="center" width="100%">
    <img width="300px" src="img/shared-devil.png"> 
</p>

You know how it is said that "the elites" are tricking us into hating each other to take attention off of themselves? Doesn't this make you hate them? Could it be that there is something even more subtle and wicked that is tricking us into hating them, to keep our attention off of _it_? Indeed there is.

You know how people sometimes suspect that there's an "evil global conspiracy" lurking in the shadows, responsible for all the world's ills? They are not crazy. They are subconsciously sensing something genuine. There is an aspect of all of our minds communicating with itself beneath our conscious thresholds, shielding itself from discovery in _insanely_ clever ways. The closer we get to discovering it, the more it tricks us into projecting it "out there," so that we viciously attack others instead of defeating the one component of it that is within our own grasp. It stays alive because each one of us is valiantly _protecting_ our portion of it, believing that it's our friend.

<p align="center" width="100%">

This "dark entity" continually drives humanity toward various kinds of Armageddon: situations in which everyone gets to violently prove just how righteous they are. It is why the US is headed toward civil war without anyone recognizing their own complicity, and explains bitter [divorces](https://www.gottman.com/blog/this-one-thing-is-the-biggest-predictor-of-divorce/) in which each side feels like the exclusive victim / hero. Nearly the whole world is caught in its terrible sway, evil provoking "righteous" retribution at every turn, without anyone ever suspecting the true source of it all.

This is not just a wacky theory. As best I can tell, everyone who introspects carefully enough eventually discovers this. Something within your very mind is conspiring with the darkness in others to produce a kind of Hell on Earth. Every time you feel contempt for _anyone_, your devil is reaching out to give theirs a kind of secret handshake; a sinister agreement to keep this world bound in darkness. I have used the word "subconscious" to describe this activity, but that's not quite accurate. **It is completely accessible to consciousness, if you know how to look.** It is something you are _doing._ [The Devil hides in the very last place you would ever look](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gg8JYYyWSPg).

It is impossible to overstate the shock of discovering, for the first time, that you have _always_ been in on the "evil global conspiracy." It is terrifying, heartbreaking, and humbling all at once. Every single act of unkindness we've ever perpetrated has been in the service of the Beast, even when we told ourselves that it was noble. This includes not only being cruel to other people, but _all_ acts in which we skirt our conscience — such as when we "shave off a little extra" for ourselves at the expense of others, or take pleasure in others' suffering, or countless other "innocent" misbehaviors.

To be clear: there are surely groups of particularly "endarkened" people who conspire to cause great harm, but their existence wouldn't be possible if the rest of us weren't feeding the source — and conversely, it is _completely inevitable_ given that we are. **We must hold such people accountable** — but when we do it with contempt, we are reinforcing the very conditions that _compel_ their existence. They will continue to exist for as long as we each cherish the "right" to harbor a little darkness ourselves.

<p align="center" width="100%">
    <img width="300px" src="img/evil-conspiracy.png"> 
</p>

Ironically, we have no leg to stand on if we're still feeling self-righteous, because that is the surest sign that we are still under the demon's malevolent sway. This is precisely the opposite of what that emotion tells us — that the more we feel it, the more _free_ of evil we must surely be. It is actually impossible to fight evil from this place, because self-deception can only ever create more of itself.

Our true enemy is not other people, but the dark "entity" that has captured _all_ of our minds. By keeping our attention fixated perpetually outward, it ensures that we never introspect deeply enough to discover our own complicity in keeping it alive.

Perhaps MLK said it best:

> *Darkness cannot drive out darkness; only light can do that. Hate cannot drive out hate; only love can do that.*

Ultimately, evil is not actually a _presence_ (like it seems), but an _absence_. The absence of what? Of the perception of the profound interconnectedness of all Life; of our fundamental equality with others. Ultimately, all self-deception boils down to willful ignorance of this truth. It is simply not possible to reduce the darkness in the world by withholding our own Light; by leveraging our contempt, malice, hatred, etc. That is an insidious trap that we _must_ see through if humanity is to survive.

Your Light is capable of accomplishing everything you _think_ you need your darkness for, and much more — but there is a price that must be paid: you will have to give up the illusion of being special; one of the few "good people" fighting the hordes of evil. You must relinquish the sinister pleasure of watching your enemies "get owned." In short, you must give up self-deception.

In exchange, you will discover how to move toward the world you actually want in your deepest heart of hearts. It is well worth the price, and more.

## Footnotes

[^contempt]: Specifically, we mean (genuine) contempt for *people*. Contempt for ideas or behaviors can actually be healthy, as perhaps can (apparent) contempt that is rooted in genuine compassion.

[^credit]: In fact, taking credit for it is one way to be sure that you haven't found it.

[^dalai-lama-gun]: The Dalai Lama was once asked what you should do if a gunman is trying to shoot you and you have a gun. [He said "shoot back."](https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/dalai-gun/)

[^genocide]: This is what permits genocide. The Nazis referred to Jews as 'vermin,' and during the genocide in Rwanda, Tutsis were referred to as 'cockroaches.' This is a common pattern throughout history. Perhaps paradoxically, the only way to be sure that you'd never do such a thing is that you don't feel contempt for the people who have.
